The [[American Psychiatric Association]] have criticized the clinical appropriateness of Amen's use of  brain scans, stating, "the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown."&lt;ref name="Association2006"/&gt;

==Operations==
Amen Clinics was founded in 1989. It has been using brain SPECT in an attempt to diagnose and treat psychiatric illness since 1991.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost&gt;{{cite web | title = Change Your Brain, Change Your Body | author = Daniel G.

As of 2014, Amen Clinics had a database of more than 100,000 functional brain scans.&lt;ref name=molecularimaging&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.molecularimaging.net/topics/molecular-imaging/neuroimaging/new-spect-database-holds-100k-scans-psychiatric-study | title = New SPECT database holds 100K scans for psychiatric study | author = Kathy Mahdoubi | publisher = Molecular Imaging | date = 13 October 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects are from 111 countries with ages from 9 months to 101 years old.&lt;ref name=molecularimaging/&gt; The database was funded in part by Seeds Foundation in Hong Kong, and developed by Daniel Amen with a team of researchers including Kristen Willeumier.&lt;ref name=molecularimaging/&gt;

Amen Clinics has worked to treat athletics-related brain damage for professional athletes, including current and 117 former [[National Football League]] players.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leighsteinberg/2013/03/09/death-of-the-nfl-part-2/ | title = Death of the NFL: Part 2 | author = Leigh Steinberg | publisher = ''[[Forbes]]'' | date = 3 September 2013 | accessdate = 19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-concussions-lawsuits-aim-to-improve-the-damaged-brain/2012/06/07/gJQA9egaLV_story.html | title = NFL concussions lawsuits aim to improve the damaged brain | author = Rick Maese | publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]'' | date = 7 June 2012 | accessdate = 19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Amen Clinics uses [[SPECT]] scans to measure blood flow and activity patterns in the brain.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="controversial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9836429/Dr-Daniel-Amen-interview-the-shrink-who-believes-technology-will-replace-the-couch.html|title=Dr Daniel Amen interview: the shrink who believes technology will replace the couch|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sanjiv|date=6 February 2013|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also uses diagnostics such as questionnaires, clinical histories, and clinical interviews.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;  Amen Clinics claims that SPECT scans enable doctors to tailor treatment to individual patients' brains. A retrospective study released by Amen in 2010 showed that "regional cerebral blood flow, as measured by SPECT, predicted stimulant response in 29 of 157 patients."&lt;ref&gt;Adinoff &amp; Devous, 2010 [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=102445#B4 Response to Amen Letter American] Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harriet A. Hall|Harriet Hall]] has written critically about SPECT scans in articles for [[Quackwatch]] and for the ''Science-Based Medicine'' website.&lt;ref name="sbm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/spect-scans-at-the-amen-clinic-a-new-phrenology/|title=SPECT Scans at the Amen Clinic – A New Phrenology?|last=Hall|first=Harriet|date=8 April 2008|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/06ResearchProjects/amen.html|title=A Skeptical View of SPECT Scans and Dr. Daniel Amen|author=Harriet Hall, M.D.|date=15 November 2007|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall accuses the clinics of misrepresenting an unproven treatment as effective, of concealing important warning information, and of creating false hopes by promising things that can't be done.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt; She dismisses the scans as "pretty pictures" and says that although Amen himself seems to believe in his approach, "humans are very good at fooling themselves".&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;

A 2011 paper co-authored by the neuroscientist [[Anjan Chatterjee (neuroscientist)|Anjan Chatterjee]] discussed example cases that were found on the Amen Clinic's website. The paper noted that the example cases "violate the [[standard of care]]" because a normal clinical diagnosis would have been sufficient and functional neuroimaging was unnecessary.&lt;ref name=chancellor/&gt; According to the [[American Psychiatric Association]], "the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown."&lt;ref name="Association2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Compendium 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zql0AqtRSrYC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2006|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-0-89042-385-1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brainwashing''' (also known as '''mind control''', '''menticide''', '''coercive persuasion''',  '''thought control''', '''thought reform''', and '''re-education''') is the concept that the [[human mind]] can be altered or controlled by certain [[psychological]] techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to [[think]] critically or independently,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Religion, Volume 2, Gyan Publishing House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, Robert Jean Campbell, Oxford University Press, USA, 2004, page 403&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Psychology, Raymond J. Corsini, Psychology Press, 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kowal, D. M. (2000). Brainwashing. In A. E. LOVE (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychology, vol. 1 (pp. 463-464). American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10516-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the [[Chinese government]] appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at [[Nazi Germany]], at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]]. It was later applied by [[Margaret Singer]], [[Philip Zimbardo]] and some others in the [[anti-cult movement]] to explain conversions to some [[new religious movement]]s and other groups. This resulted in [[scientific]] and [[legal]] debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Stuart|title=Media Coverage of Unconventional Religion: Any "Good News" for Minority Faiths?|journal=Review of Religious Research|date=December 1997|volume=39|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.2307/3512176|jstor=3512176}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eileen Barker]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]], and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite web |first=J. Gordon |last=Melton |authorlink=J. Gordon Melton |title=Brainwashing and the Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton.htm |publisher=CESNUR: Center for Studies on New Religions |date=10 December 1999 |accessdate=5 September 2009 |quote=Since the late 1980s, though a significant public belief in cult-brainwashing remains, the academic community-including scholars from psychology, sociology, and religious studies-have shared an almost unanimous consensus that the coercive persuasion/brainwashing thesis proposed by Margaret Singer and her colleagues in the 1980s is without scientific merit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other views have been expressed by scholars including: [[Dick Anthony]], [[Robert Cialdini]], [[Stanley A. Deetz]], [[Michael J. Freeman]], [[Robert Jay Lifton]],  [[Joost Meerloo]], [[Daniel Romanovsky]], [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]], [[Louis Jolyon West]], and [[Benjamin Zablocki]]. The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in legal cases, especially regarding [[child custody]]; and is also a major theme in [[science fiction]] and in criticism of modern [[political]] and  [[corporate culture]].  Although the term appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DSM-5|title=DSM-5|last=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not accepted as [[scientific fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bvem38QO9y0C|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781134636969|language = en|first = Frank|last = Usarski|page = 238|quote = ...there has been until now a lack of any convincing scientific evidence which can be applied in a generalised form to show that involvement in a New Religious Movement has any destructive consequences for the psyche of the individual concerned. ... The fact that, in all the ensuing years, no one has succeeded in verifying beyond reasonable doubt any of these claims, has however, never been regarded as a reason to exonerate the groups in any way. ... Thus, up to the time of writing, there has not been one single successful, legal conviction of the Scientology Church, even though this group has come to be regarded as the most dangerous of the new religious organisations. ... The fact that even long-term investigations have as yet failed to produce the desired results continues to be ignored.|editor-last = Cresswell|editor-first = Jamie|editor-last2 = Wilson|editor-first2 = Bryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese term ''xǐnăo'' (洗脑，literally "wash brain")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=%E6%B4%97%E8%85%A6|title=Word dictionary - 洗腦 - MDBG English to Chinese dictionary|work=mdbg.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally used to describe the coercive [[persuasion]] used under the [[Maoist]] government in China, which aimed to transform "reactionary" people into "right-thinking" members of the new Chinese social system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Kathleen |authorlink= Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title= Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url= https://books.google.com/?id=D3tYeMLc4hQC |accessdate= 2010-07-02 |year= 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-920478-6 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[pun]]ned on the [[Taoist]] custom of "cleansing/washing the heart/mind" (''xǐxīn''，洗心) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.&lt;ref&gt;'''Note:''' ''xīn'' can mean "heart", "mind" or "centre" depending on context. For example, {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心脏病|xīn zàng bìng]]}} means [[Cardiovascular disease]], but {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心理医生|xīn lǐ yī shēng]]}} means [[psychologist]], and {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:市中心|shì zhōng xīn]]}} means [[Central business district]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the earliest known English-language usage of the word "brainwashing" in an article by newspaperman [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]], in ''Miami News'', published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken [[Anti-communism|anticommunist]] and was said to be a [[CIA]] agent working undercover as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |authorlink=John D. Marks |title=The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control |url= http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LSD/marks.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30 |year=1979 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8129-0773-5 |chapter=8. Brainwashing |chapterurl=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks8.htm |quote=In September 1950, the ''[[The Miami News|Miami News]]'' published an article by Edward Hunter titled '"Brain-Washing" Tactics Force Chinese into Ranks of Communist Party.' It was the first printed use in any language of the term "brainwashing," Hunter, a CIA propaganda operator who worked under cover as a journalist, turned out a steady stream of books and articles on the subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953), some American [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, even in a few cases defected to their side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Browning |title=Was Kidnapped Utah Teen Brainwashed? |work=[[Palm Beach Post]] |location=Palm Beach |issn=1528-5758 |date=2003-03-14 |quote=During the Korean War, captured American soldiers were subjected to prolonged interrogations and harangues by their captors, who often worked in relays and used the "good-cop, bad-cop" approach, alternating a brutal interrogator with a gentle one. It was all part of "Xi Nao," washing the brain. The Chinese and Koreans were making valiant attempts to convert the captives to the communist way of thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt; British radio operator [[Robert W. Ford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford RC |authorlink=Robert W. Ford |title= Captured in Tibet |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-19-581570-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert W. Ford |author=Ford RC |title=Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet |publisher=SLG Books |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-9617066-9-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British army Colonel [[James Carne]] also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their war-era imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/02/23/83712037.pdf "Red Germ Charges Cite 2 U.S. Marines," 23 February 1954], accessed 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine  confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|biological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. [[Mark W. Clark]] asserted:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/02/24/93602632.pdf "Clark Denounces Germ War Charges", 24 February 1953], accessed 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want .... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.''

Beginning in 1953, [[Robert Jay Lifton]] interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the [[Korean War]] as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China]]'', was based on this research.)&lt;ref&gt;A. L.

In 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled ''Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War'', which called brainwashing a "popular misconception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = U.S Department of the Army | authorlink = | title = Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War. |publisher =U.S Gov't Printing Office | series = | volume = | edition =Pamphlet number 30-101 | date =15 May 1956 | location = | pages = 17 &amp; 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea."&lt;ref name="CommunistInterogation51"&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future [[totalitarian]] society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry and Public Affairs, Leo H.

In the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'', ''[[The Bamboo Prison]]'', ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'', and ''[[The Fearmakers]]''. ''[[Forbidden Area]]'' told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through [[classical conditioning]] by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (based on the 1959 novel by [[Richard Condon]]) "put brainwashing front and center" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Enemies of the American Way: Political Paranoia About Nazis, Communists, Saboteurs, Terrorists and Body Snatching Aliens in Film and Television'', Fraser A.

Mind control remains an important theme in [[science fiction]]. Terry O'Brien comments: "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brien in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A subgenre is ''corporate mind control'', in which a future society is run by one or more business [[corporations]] that dominate society using [[advertising]] and [[mass media]] to control the population's thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Per Schelde, ''Androids, Humanoids, and Other Science Fiction Monsters: Science and Soul in Science Fiction Films'', NYU Press, 1 July 1994, pages 169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==
In 1974, [[Patty Hearst]], a member of the wealthy [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst family]], was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a left-wing group calling itself the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities.  In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony.  Her attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]] argued in her trial  that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: [[diminished responsibility]].)  Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe, James T. Richardson, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012, page 518&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 1969 to 1971 case of [[Charles Manson]], who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology'', by Charles Patrick Ewing, Joseph T.

Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist [[Louis Jolyon West]] and psychologist [[Margaret Singer]].  They had both studied the experiences of  Korean War POWs. In 1996 Singer published her theories in her best-selling book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]''.&lt;ref name="refocus.org"&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202034934/http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html |date=2 February 2015 }}, Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|isbn=9781134499700|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter|last2=Clarke|first2=Reader in Modern History Fellow Peter|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/us/louis-j-west-74-psychiatrist-who-studied-extremes-dies.html|title=Louis J.

[[Italy]] has had controversy over the concept of ''[[plagio]]'', a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]] and the consequent negation of his or her [[personality]]. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Usai “Profili penali dei condizionamenti mentali, Milano, 1996 {{ISBN|88-14-06071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied "with some success" in  [[child custody]] and [[child sexual abuse]] cases.

:''In the 1980s there was a wave of ‘brainwashing’ claims, and then parliaments around the world examined the issue, courts around the world examined the issue, and reached a clear ruling: That there is no such thing as cults…that the people making these claims are often not experts on the issue. And in the end courts, including in Israel, rejected expert witnesses who claimed there is "brainwashing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/will-israels-first-anti-cult-legislation-harm-religious-freedom], ''[[Times of Israel]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;''

It is neither magical nor mystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo 1997 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a [[pseudo-scientific]] approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's [[worldview]] was substantially changed by these coercive methods.

Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of "brainwashing"), fewer than 25% joined the group for more than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later.

===American Psychological Association on brainwashing===
{{Main article|APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control}}
In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.
&lt;ref&gt;
As archived at http://www.cesnur.org/testi/DIMPAC.htm, retrieved 2008-06-23
&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the following conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;

''Cults and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded that "after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force.

Russian historian [[Daniel Romanovsky]], who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called "[[Nazi]] brainwashing" of the people of [[Belarus]] by the occupying Germans during the [[Second World War]], which took place through both mass [[propaganda]] and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the [[Soviet]] government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Europe and the Final Solution'', David Bankier, Israel Gutman, Berghahn Books, 2009, page 282-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Jonathan Petropoulos, John Roth, Berghahn Books, Jul 15, 2005, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minsk Ghetto 1941-1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism, Barbara Epstein, University of California Press, 2008, page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Postcommunist Europe, John-Paul Himka, Joanna Beata Michlic, University of Nebraska Press, Jul 1, 2013, pages 74, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/soviet_jews_exodus/English/Interview_s/InterviewRomanovsky.shtml Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU6WielZ_VoC&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Soviet Person as a Bystander of the Holocaust: The case of eastern Belorussia|first=Daniel|last=Romanovsky|page=276|title=Nazi Europe and the Final Solution|editor-first=David|editor-last=Bankier|editor2-first=Israel|editor2-last=Gutman|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books}}

[[Joost Meerloo]], a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. ("Menticide" is a [[neologism]] coined by him meaning: "killing of the mind.") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the [[interrogation]] of accused [[Nazi war criminals]]. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Propaganda Studies, Jonathan Auerbach, Russ Castronovo, Oxford University Press, 2014, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; His best-selling 1956 book, ''The Rape of the Mind'', concludes by saying: 
:''The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide—those perversions of psychology—can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.'' &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite web |author= [[Joost Meerloo|Meerloo, Joost]] |url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html |title=''The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing'' |year=1956 |publisher=World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have said that modern [[business corporation]]s practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Leadership: Individual, Organizational, and Societal Perspectives'', Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling, Scott Taylor, Oxford University Press, 30 June 2011, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have linked "corporate brainwashing" with [[globalization]], saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide [[Cultural homogenization|monocultural]] network of producers, consumers, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Anti-corporate Movement: Corporations and the People who Hate Them'', Evan Osborne, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''More Money Than Brains: Why School Sucks, College is Crap, &amp; Idiots Think They're Right'', [[Laura Penny]], McClelland &amp; Stewart, 20 April 2010, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 book, ''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization'', [[Stanley A. Deetz]] says that modern "[[self awareness]]" and "[[self improvement]]" programs provide corporations with even more effective tools to control the minds of employees than traditional brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization: Developments in Communication and the Politics of Everyday Life'', Stanley Deetz, SUNY Press, 1 January 1992, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2000 book, ''Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the [[War on Terrorism]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including [[thought-terminating cliché]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Destroying the ''World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Owl Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2004 [[popular science]] book, ''[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]'', [[neuroscientist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. She suggests that persons under its influence have more rigid [[neurological]] pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Szimhart | first =Joseph | title =Thoughts on thought control | journal =[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume =29 | issue =4 | pages =56–57 | date =July–August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers  praised her book for its clear presentation, while some criticized it for oversimplification.&lt;ref name="lefanu"&gt;{{cite news | last =Le Fanu | first =James | title =Make up your mind | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher =Telegraph Media Group Limited | date =20 December 2004 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/12/19/botay19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2004/12/19/bomain.html | accessdate = 2008-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hawkes | first =Nigel | title =Brainwashing by Kathleen Taylor | work =[[The Times]] | publisher =Times Newspapers Ltd | date =27 November 2004 | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article395436.ece | accessdate = 2008-11-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Caterson | first =Simon | title =Hell to pay when man bites God | work =[[The Australian]] | page =4 | date =2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Kathleen Eleanor |authorlink=Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title=Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BIuju20yhDkC&amp;dq |accessdate=2009-07-30 |date=December 2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280496-9 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Characterology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} "character" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a method of character reading that attempted to combine revised [[physiognomy]], reconstructed [[phrenology]] and amplified [[pathognomy]], with [[ethnology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].  Developed by [[L. Hamilton McCormick]] in the 1920s, characterology was an attempt to produce a scientific, objective system to assess an individual's character.

Characterology attempted to resolve flaws in the phrenological systems of [[Franz Joseph Gall]] 
and [[Johann Spurzheim]]. McCormick tried to distance himself from those earlier systems, and wrote extensively about how his ideas improved upon them.

McCormick suggested possible applications for characterology, e.g., advice for [[parent]]s and [[educator]]s, guidance in [[military]] officer promotions, evaluating [[thinking]] patterns (i.e., [[reason]]-oriented or [[memory]]-oriented ), assessing  business associates and competitors, career counseling, and selecting [[marriage|marital partners]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">In the [[social science|social sciences]], '''coding''' is an analytical process in which data, in both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] form (such as [[questionnaire]]s results) or [[qualitative research|qualitative]] form (such as [[interview]] [[:wikt:transcript|transcript]]s) are categorized to facilitate analysis.

One purpose of coding is to [[data transformation|transform the data]] into a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. This categorization of [[information]] is an important step, for example, in preparing [[data]] for [[computer]] processing with [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].

Some studies will employ multiple coders working independently on the same data. This minimizes the chance of [[observational error|errors]] from coding and is believed to increase the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of data.

==Directive==
One code should apply to only one category and categories should be comprehensive. There should be clear guidelines for ''coders'' (individual who do the coding) so that code is consistent.

==Quantitative approach==
For quantitative analysis, data is coded usually into [[levels of measurement|measured and recorded as nominal or ordinal]] [[Variable (programming)|variables]].

Questionnaire data can be ''pre-coded'' (process of assigning codes to expected answers on designed questionnaire), ''field-coded'' (process of assigning codes as soon as data is available, usually during [[fieldwork]]), ''post-coded'' (coding of [[Open-ended question|open question]]s on completed questionnaires) or ''office-coded'' (done after fieldwork). Note that some of the above are not mutually exclusive.

In social sciences, [[spreadsheets]] such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and more advanced software packages such as [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Matlab]], [[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[DAP (software)|DAP]]/[[SAS System|SAS]], [[MiniTab]] and [[Stata]] are often used.

==Qualitative approach==
For disciplines in which a [[qualitative research|qualitative]] format is preferential, including [[ethnography]], [[humanistic geography]] or [[phenomenological psychology]] a varied approach to coding can be applied. Iain Hay (2005) outlines a two-step process beginning with basic coding in order to distinguish overall themes, followed by a more in depth, interpretive code in which more specific trends and patterns can be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, I. (2005). ''Qualitative research methods in human geography'' (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of qualitative coding can be attributed to either grounded or ''a priori'' coding.&lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, Johnny. (2015). "The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers" (3rd ed.). SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Grounded coding refers to allowing notable themes and patterns emerge from the document themselves, where as ''a priori'' coding requires the researcher to apply pre-existing theoretical frameworks to analyze the documents. As coding methods are applied across various texts, the researcher is able to apply axial coding, which is the process of selecting core thematic categories present in several documents to discover common patterns and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Grbich, Carol. (2013). "Qualitative Data Analysis" (2nd ed.). The Flinders University of South Australia: SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to constructing categories, a researcher must apply a first cycle coding method. There are a multitude of methods available, and a researcher will want to pick one that is suited for the format and nature of their documents. Not all methods can be applied to every type of document. Some examples of first cycle coding methods include:

*''In Vivo Coding'': codes terms and phrases used by the participants themselves. The objective is to attempt to give the participants a voice in the research.
*''Process Coding'': this method uses gerunds ("-ing" words) only to describe and display actions throughout the document. It is useful for examining processes, emotional phases and rituals.
*''Versus Coding'': uses binary terms to describe groups and processes. The goal is to see which processes and organizations are in conflict with each other throughout the document. These can be both conceptual and grounded objects. 
*''Values Coding'': codes that attempt to exhibit the inferred values, attitudes and beliefs of participants. In doing so, the research may discern patterns in world views.

The process can be done manually, which can be as simple as highlighting different concepts with different colours, or fed into a software package. Some examples of [[computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software|qualitative software packages]] include [[Atlas.ti]], [[MAXQDA]], [[NVivo]], and [[QDA Miner]].

After assembling codes it is time to organize them into broader themes and categories. The process generally involves identifying themes from the existing codes, reducing the themes to a manageable number, creating hierarchies within the themes and then linking themes together through theoretical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Gery and H. Bernard. (2003). "Techniques to Identify Themes." Field Methods. Vol.15(1). pp85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memos==
Creating memos during the coding process is integral to both grounded and a priori coding approaches. Qualitative research is inherently reflexive; as the researcher delves deeper into their subject, it is important to chronicle their own thought processes through reflective or methodological memos, as doing so may highlight their own subjective interpretations of data &lt;ref&gt;Primeau, Loree A. (2003). "Reflections on Self in Qualitative Research: Stories of Family" The American Journal of Occupational Therapy. Vol. 57, 9-16&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial to begin memoing at the onset of research. Regardless of the type of memo produced, what is important is that the process initiates critical thinking and productivity in the research. Doing so will facilitate easier and more coherent analyses as the project draws on &lt;ref&gt;Charmaz, Kathy. (2006). "Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis." SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Memos can be used to map research activities, uncover meaning from data, maintaining research momentum and engagement and opening communication.&lt;ref&gt;Birks et al. (2008). "Memoing in qualitative research" Journal of Research in Nursing. SAGE Publications. Vol. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crop circle''' or '''crop formation''' is a pattern created by flattening a [[crop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crop-circle?q=crop+circle|title=crop circle - Definition of crop circle in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually a [[cereal]].

The number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]].&lt;ref name="northcote"&gt;{{cite web |author= Jeremy Northcote |url= http://www.siue.edu/GEOGRAPHY/ONLINE/Northcote06.pdf |title= Spatial distribution of England's crop circles |journal= Geography Online |publisher= [[Southern Illinois University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"/&gt;

Formations are usually created overnight,&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; although some are reported to have appeared during the day.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 140–42}} In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause [[cropmark]]s in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year.

== History ==

The concept of "crop circles" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see [[#Bower and Chorley|Bower and Chorley]], below).&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Demon-Haunted World]] |author= Carl Sagan |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |pages= 72–76|isbn= 0747251568 |publisher= [[Headline Publishing Group]] |ref= {{harvid|Sagan|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGEO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |author1= Rob Irving |author2= Peter Brookesmith |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Crop-Circles-The-Art-of-the-Hoax.html |title= Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |work= Smithsonian.com |date= December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that they were inspired by the [[Tully, Queensland|Tully]] "saucer nest" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;

=== Before the 20th century ===

A 1678 news pamphlet ''[[Mowing-Devil|The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire]]'' is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; (see [[#Folklore|folklore section]]).

In 1686, British [[naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see [[fairy ring]]s) in ''The Natural History of Stafford-Shire'' and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause.&lt;ref name=NatHist&gt;{{cite book |author= John Aubrey |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |title= The Natural History of Stafford-Shire |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402233131/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |archivedate= 2 April 2007 |df= dmy-all }} at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhiloTrans&gt;{{cite journal |title= ''The Natural History of Staffordshire'' by Robert Plott; ''Sciotericum Telescopicum or a new Contrivance of adapting a Telescope to a Horizontall Diall, for observing the moment of time by day or night'' by Will Molineux |journal= Philosophical Transactions |volume= 16 (1686–1692) |jstor= 101866 |pages= 207–16 |department= Accounts of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by [[Erich von Däniken]].{{refn|group=n|Keving Greene wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulties that exist in communicating the results of archaeology have undoubtedly contributed to the flourishing of writers, such as Erich von Däniken, who take a particular delight in deriding the inability of 'experts' to find explanations that seize the imagination of the public. (...) Few archaeologists have sold as many paperbacks as von Däniken; more recently, a meteorologist who linked crop circles to prehistoric ring-ditches or round barrows generated a reaction that no orthodox student of these monuments has ever achieved (Meaden 1991) [in reference to {{cite book |author= T.

An 1880 letter to the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by amateur scientist [[John Rand Capron]] describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.{{refn|name="Capron1880"|group=n|John Rand Capron wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The storms about this part of Surrey have been lately local and violent, and the effects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour's farm on Wednesday evening (21st), we found a field of standing wheat considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots (...) they all presented much the same character, viz, a few standing stalks as a centre, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside there a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered. (...) I could not trace locally any circumstances accounting for the peculiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall. They were suggestive to me of some cyclonic wind action, and may perhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/022290d0 |bibcode= 1880Natur..22..290C |title= Storm Effects |url= http://www.iccra.org/Historical%20Research/Storm%20Effects_Nature_1880_J_Rand_Capron.pdf |year= 1880 |author= John Rand Capron |journal= Nature |volume= 22 |issue= 561 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CJlFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 290]}} Retrieved from {{cite web |title= Nature archive for the decade 1880–1889 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/currentdecade.html?decade=1880&amp;year=1880 |work= nature.com |publisher= Nature |accessdate= 23 August 2011}} Republished in {{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BGIdAQAAIAAJ |title= A case of genuine crop circles dating from July 1880 – as published in Nature in the year 1880 |journal= Journal of Meteorology |volume= 25 |pages= 20–21 |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

=== 20th century ===
In 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: "a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up."&lt;ref&gt;Sussex Notes and Queries, 1937 Eliot Cecil Curwen pp. 139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, amateur astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of "spiral flattening". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.&lt;ref&gt;Moore P. ‘That Wiltshire Crater’ Letter to the editor ''New Scientist'' 8 August 1963
{{blockquote|1=In the adjoining wheatfields were other features, taking the form of circular or elliptical areas in which the wheat had been flattened. I saw these myself; they had not been much visited, and were certainly peculiar One, very well-defined, was an oval 15 yards long by 41 broad. There was evidence of "spiral flattening", and in one case there was a circular area in the centre in which the wheat had not been flattened. In no case was there any evidence of an actual depression in the ground.

(...) [The crater] could have been caused by natural subsidence, but it did not give that impression, and in any case there are the areas of flattened wheat to be taken into account; it would be remarkable coincidence if these areas were not associated with the crater. Since the areas of flattened wheat "led" to the crater, it looks very much as though they, and the crater, were caused by something which came from the sky. In this case, the wheat would have been flattened by violent air-currents produced by the falling body.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Hugh Ernest Butler]] observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ernest Butler 'That Wiltshire Crater', ''New Scientist'' issue 352, 15 August 1963 Letters to the editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, in [[Tully, Queensland]], Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in [[Duhamel, Alberta]], Canada; [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ufo/002029-1200-e.html |title= Canada's Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown: Duhamel, Alberta: August 1967 |date= 14 December 2007 |origyear= 2005}} At Library and Archives Canada. ([http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ovni/002029-1200.01-f.html Original] in French).&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous case is the 1966 Tully "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or {{convert|40|ft|m}} from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud.&lt;ref name=skepticssa&gt;{{cite web |author= Laurie Eddie |date= 4 November 2004 |url= http://www.skepticssa.org.au/html/cropcircles.html |title= The Skeptics SA Guide to: Crop circles |work= Skepticssa.org.au. |publisher= Skeptics SA |accessdate= 2012-01-01 |ref= {{harvid|Eddie|2004}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local police officer, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the [[University of Queensland]] concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a [[willy-willy]] (dust devil), or a [[waterspout]]. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the "saucer" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The flattened crops society |work= [[The Scotsman]] |date= September 7, 2002 | author= Jim Gilchrist |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12991491.html }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in [[Wiltshire]], and there were rumours of "saucer nests" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; In ''[[Fortean Times]]'' David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near [[Gloucestershire]] using ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eddie|2004}} citing: {{cite journal |author= D. Wood |year= 2000 |title= Pioneer pranksters? |journal= [[Fortean Times]] |volume= 131 |issue= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' recorded the earliest usage of the term "crop circles" in a 1988 issue of ''[[Journal of Meteorology]]'', referring to a BBC film.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', "Crop: Draft additions 1997", in '' Jrnl. Meteorol''. 13 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The coining of the term "crop circle" is attributed to [[Colin Andrews]] in the late 1970s or early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Brian Regal |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 2009 |isbn= 9780313355073 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?ei=2aNnUpPmK-LT0QWBxIGIDw&amp;id=14AbAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22crop+circles%22++colin+andrews+coined&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=coined 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/5452330/Crop-circle-picture-gallery-shows-more-complex-forms.html |title= Crop circle picture gallery shows more complex forms |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 5 June 2009 |accessdate= 23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite book |title= Reframing Dutch Culture: Between Otherness and Authenticity |series= Progress in European Ethnology |author1= Peter Jan Margry |author2= Herman Roodenburg |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]] |year= 2007 |pages= 150–51 |isbn= 9780754647058 |ref= {{harvid|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in [[Hampshire]] and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Disease brings poor crop of circles | newspaper = BBC News | date = 2001-08-17 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1496296.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name=NGEO&gt;{{cite news |author= Hillary Mayell |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles.html |title= Crop circles: Artwork or alien signs |page= [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles_2.html 2] |magazine= National Geographic |date= 2 August 2002 |accessdate= 28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.

=== 21st century ===
Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Benjamin Radford |url= http://www.livescience.com/6546-beautiful-math-equation-crop-circle.html |title= 'Beautiful Math Equation' Found in Crop Circle |work= [[LiveScience]] |date= 8 June 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Marc West |date= 2008-06-30 |url= http://plus.maths.org/content/pi-appears-crop-circle |title= Pi appears in crop circle |work= plus.maths.org. |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/crop-circle-season-arrives-with-a-mathematical-message-1982647.html |title= Crop circle season arrives with a mathematical message |department= This Britain |newspaper= The Independent |date= 2010-05-26 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]]. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]], long barrows such as [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], and [[:Category:White horses in England|white horses in chalk hills]].&lt;ref name="northcote"/&gt;

== Bower and Chorley ==
In 1991, self-professed [[practical joke|pranksters]] Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line.&lt;ref name="today91"&gt;{{cite news |author= Graham Brough |year= 1991 |title= Men who conned the world |newspaper= Today (defunct) |location= UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a "cereologist" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 'Jovial Con Men' Demystify Those Crop Circles in Britain |newspaper= New York Times |author= William E.

According to Professor Richard Taylor, "the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe."&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

''Smithsonian'' magazine wrote:

:Since Bower and Chorley’s circles appeared, the geometric designs have escalated in scale and complexity, as each year teams of anonymous circle-makers lay honey traps for New Age tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/crop-circles-the-art-of-the-hoax-2524283/ |title=Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |newspaper=Smithsonian |first1=Rob |last1=Irving |first2=Peter |last2=Brookesmith |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective ''Circlemakers,'' founded by artists [[Rod Dickinson]] and [[John Lundberg]] (and subsequently including artists Wil Russell and Rob Irving), have been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of their art practice and for commercial clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Henry Hemming |year= 2009 |title= In Search of the English Eccentric |publisher= John Murray |isbn= 0719522129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning entry was produced by three [[Westland Helicopters]] engineers, using rope, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe, a plank, string, a telescopic device and two stepladders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= David Jenkins |title= Crop circle conundrum |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/7955868/Crop-circle-conundrum.html |accessdate= 10 August 2012 |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rupert Sheldrake, the competition was organised by him and [[John Michell]] and "co-sponsored by The Guardian and The Cerealogist". The prize money came from ''PM'', a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that "The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rupert Sheldrake |title= The Crop Circle Making Competition |url= http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&amp;Papers/articles/pdf/Cropcircles_Michellany.pdf |publisher= Rupert Sheldrake |accessdate= 10 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121207041147/http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles%26Papers/articles/pdf/Cropcircles_Michellany.pdf |archivedate= 7 December 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Discovery Channel]] commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from [[MIT]] to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish "real" crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley. The creation of the circle was recorded and used in the Discovery Channel documentary ''Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields''.&lt;ref name=discovery1&gt;{{cite AV media |title= Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2002-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''The Guardian'' reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts.&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"/&gt;

A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic rings]].  Another Olympic crop circle was visible to passengers landing at nearby [[Heathrow Airport]] before and during the Games.&lt;ref name="olympic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnclarke/2012/07/09/mystery-crop-circles-revealed-as-olympic-publicity-stunt/|title=Mystery Crop Circles Revealed As Olympic Publicity Stunt|last=Clarke|first=John|date=July 9, 2012|publisher=''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal implications ==
In 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in [[agriculture]], created a {{convert|36|m|adj=on}} diameter crop circle in a wheat field near [[Székesfehérvár]], {{convert|43|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Budapest]], on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian forint|Ft]] (~$3,000 USD) in [[damages]]. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000&amp;nbsp;Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media's promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students' legal fees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Creation ==
[[File:Swiss crop circle detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of a crop circle in a field in Switzerland]]
The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, [[advertising]], or [[Crop art#Crop circles|art]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;

Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |title= Crop-circle mania: An investigative update |journal= Skeptical Inquirer}} Cited as reference 6 in {{harvnb|Nickell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Bower and Chorley and tabloid ''Today'' hoaxing Pat Delgado,&lt;ref name="today91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"/&gt; the Wessex Sceptics and [[Channel 4]]'s ''Equinox'' hoaxing Terence Meaden,&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"&gt;{{cite news |title= Flattened.

Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the [[Internet]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising.&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|name= "Cohen2008"}} Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,{{refn|group=n|The website Crop Circle Research.com described one formation stating, "It looks reminiscent of a fake dummy constructed by 'Balok' in a Star Trek episode called '[[The Corbomite Maneuver|Corbomite Manourvre]]'{{sic}} (series 1)' or the logo of local soccer club [[Feyenoord]]".{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}}}}

== Alternative explanations ==
=== Weather ===
It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak [[tornado]]es to [[ball lightning]], but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/circular_reasoning_the_mystery_of_crop_circles_and_their_orbs_of_light/ |title= Circular Reasoning: The 'Mystery' of Crop Circles and Their 'Orbs' of Light |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 26.5 |date=September–October 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206012813/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-09/crop-circles.html |archivedate= 2006-12-06 |deadurl= no |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal ''Nature'' about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was "suggestive of some cyclonic wind action".{{refn|group=n|name= "Capron1880"}}

In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic "plasma vortex".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] who said that, "Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2011|title=Coming soon to a field near you|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/richardtaylor/files/2015/12/CropCirclesphysicsworld-1o814jx.pdf|department=Feature: Crop circles|journal=Physics World|ref={{harvid|Taylor|2011}}|author=Richard Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles.{{refn|group=n|name="Taylor2011_note"|In a ''Physics World'' article Richard Taylor wrote, "Today, with the benefit of hindsight, such explanations sound rather contrived. At the height of the debate, though, no less a physicist than Stephen Hawking was prepared to accept some version of Meaden's theory.

Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various [[paranormal]], [[ufology|ufological]], and [[forteana|anomalistic]] investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5777580/Mayan-apocalypse-crop-circle-appears-at-Silbury-Hill.html |title= Mayan 'apocalypse' crop circle appears at Silbury Hill |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1&gt;{{cite book |author= Eltjo Haselhoff |year= 2001 |title= The Deepening Complexity of Crop Circles: Scientific Research &amp; Urban Legends |publisher= Frog Ltd |isbn= 1583940464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark1&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jerome Clark |author2= Nancy Pear |year= 1995 |title= Strange and Unexplained Happenings: When Nature Breaks the Rules of Science |publisher= [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |volume= 3 |isbn= 0810397803}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1/&gt;{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 138–39}}&lt;ref name=faussett1&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Godfrey-Faussett |year= 2004 |title= England |series= Footprint Travel Guides |isbn= 1903471915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many  [[New Age]] groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.

Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}} Some proposed entities are: [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] asking to stop [[global warming]] and human [[pollution]], God, supernatural beings (for example Indian [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed "quantum field", or extraterrestrial beings.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}}

Responding to local beliefs that "extraterrestrial beings" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) described crop circles as "man-made". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, "We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven." Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and [[anomalistics|anomalistic]] investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] by [[scientific skepticism|sceptical]] groups and scientists, including the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author= John Vidal |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/05/ruralaffairs |title= The bizarre revival of crop circles – and advice on how to make your own |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickell1996&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=June 1996 |volume= 6.2 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/levengoods_crop-circle_plant_research |title=Levengood’s crop-circle plant research |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=levengood1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.C.

=== Animal activity ===
In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of [[Tasmania]] stated that Australian [[Wallaby|wallabies]] had been found creating crop circles in fields of [[opium poppy|opium poppies]], which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper= BBC News | date= 25 June 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8118257.stm|title=Stoned wallabies make crop circles|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to crops ===
A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late&lt;!--described as semi-retired by csicop source--&gt; biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt;

Levengood published papers in journal ''[[Physiologia Plantarum]]'' in 1994&lt;ref name=levengood1994 /&gt; and 1999.&lt;ref name=levengood1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1= W.C.

Talbott |year= 1999 |title= Dispersion of energies in worldwide crop formations |journal= Physiologia Plantarum |volume= 105 |pages= 615–24 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle.&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; In 1996 sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] objected that [[correlation is not causation]],&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; raised several objections to the Levengood's methods and assumptions,&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt; and said "Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites." (in reference to [[cattle mutilation]]).&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt;

A study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the [[pulvini]] of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, "suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood's observations of stunted seed growth."

=== Magnetism ===
In 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the [[Earth's magnetic field]], that creates a current that "electrocutes" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/872142.stm | title=Magnetic 'solution' to crop circle puzzle | work=BBC News | date=9 August 2000 | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old [[Folklore|folkloric]] tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 152}}

Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of "[[Fairy ring|fairie rings]]".&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Tales also mention [[Will-o'-the-wisp|balls of light]] many times but never in relation to crop circles.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

[[File:Diablefaucheur.jpg|thumb|upright|1678 pamphlet on the "[[Mowing-Devil]]".]]

A 17th-century English [[woodcut]] called the ''[[Mowing-Devil]]'' depicts the [[devil]] with a [[scythe]] mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The [[pamphlet]] containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have "the devil himself" perform the task.  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

In the 1948 German story ''Die zwölf Schwäne'' (''The Twelve Swans''), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve [[swan maiden|princesses disguised as swans]], who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

'''''Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe''''' is a science book by [[mathematical physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] published by [[The Bodley Head]] in 2010. The book outlines Penrose's [[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology]] (CCC) model, which is an extension of [[general relativity]] but opposed to the widely supported multidimensional [[String theory|string theories]] and [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] following the [[Big Bang]].

==Synopsis==
Penrose examines implications of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second Law]] of Thermodynamics and its inevitable march toward a maximum [[entropy]] state of the [[universe]]. Penrose illustrates entropy in terms of information state [[phase space]] (with 1 dimension for every [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]) where particles end up moving through ever larger grains of this phase space from smaller grains over time due to random motion. He disagrees with [[Stephen Hawking]]'s back-track&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawking|first=S.W.|title=Information Loss in Black Holes|journal=Physical Review D|date=18 July 2005|volume=72|issue=8 |pages=084013|arxiv=hep-th/0507171 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.72.084013 |bibcode = 2005PhRvD..72h4013H }}&lt;/ref&gt; over whether [[Black hole information paradox|information is destroyed]] when matter enters [[black holes]]. Such information loss would non-trivially lower total entropy in the universe as the black holes wither away due to [[Hawking radiation]], resulting in a loss in phase space degrees of freedom.

Penrose goes on further to state that over enormous scales of time (beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years), distance ceases to be meaningful as all [[mass]] breaks down into extremely [[red shift|red-shifted]] [[photon]] energy, whereupon time has no influence, and the universe continues to expand without event {{math|[[Arrow (symbol)|→]]}}{{math|[[Infinity|∞]]}}. This period from Big Bang to infinite expansion Penrose defines as an [[aeon]]. The smooth [[no-hair theorem|“hairless”]] [[Infinity|infinite]] oblivion of the previous aeon becomes the low-entropy Big Bang state of the next aeon cycle. [[Conformal geometry]] preserves the angles but not the distances of the previous aeon, allowing the new aeon universe to appear quite small at its inception as its phase space starts anew.

Penrose cites concentric rings found in the [[WMAP]] [[cosmic microwave background]] survey as preliminary evidence for his model, as he predicted black hole collisions from the previous aeon would leave such structures due to ripples of [[gravitational waves]].

==Reception==
Most nonexpert critics (nonscientists) have found the book a challenge to fully comprehend; a few such as ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe – Review|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doug Johnstone for ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnstone|first=Doug|title=Book reviews: The Grand Design {{!}} Cycles of Time|url=http://living.scotsman.com/books/Book-reviews-The-Grand-Design.6538072.jp|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; appreciate the against the grain innovative ideas Penrose puts forth. [[Quantum (book)|Manjit Kumar]] reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' admires the [[Russian doll]] geometry play of the CCC concept, framing it as an idea of which [[M. C. Escher]] "would have approved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Manjit|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe by Roger Penrose – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|accessdate=27 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Storrs for the ''New York Journal of Books'' concedes that this is not the book that an unambitious lay person should plunge into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storrs|first=Graham|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe|journal=New York Journal of Books|date=3 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/cycles-time-extraordinary-new-view-universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American fiction writer [[Anthony Doerr]] in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' writes "Penrose has never shied away from including mathematics in his texts, and kudos to his publisher for honoring that wish. That said, the second half of ''Cycles of Time'' offers some seriously hard sledding"; "If you'll forgive a skiing metaphor, ''Cycles of Time'' is a black diamond of a book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doerr|first=Anthony|title=The music of physics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28691694.html|accessdate=15 April 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2011|agency=(subscription required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the phenomenon ''E'' as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

==Growth==

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

Scientific explanations increasingly pose not [[determinism]]'s universal laws, but [[probabilism]]'s chance,&lt;ref name=Karhausen/&gt; ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;  Smoking's contribution to [[lung cancer]] fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 3], subch "Repudiation of DN model of explanation", pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An [[applied science]] that applies [[statistics]] seeking associations between events, [[epidemiology]] cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.&lt;ref name=Rothman-Greenland&gt;{{Cite journal

See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertia is the state of a body experiencing no acceleration, whether by change in speed—either quickening or slowing—or by change in direction, and thus exhibits constant [[velocity]], which is speed plus direction.&lt;/ref&gt; which, by omitting aether,&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=ether pp 29–30].&lt;/ref&gt; converted space and time into ''relative'' phenomena whose relativity aligned [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]] with the Newtonian principle [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity or invariance]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To explain absolute light speed without aether, Einstein modeled that a body at motion in an electromagnetic field experiences [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], which [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had already modeled as [[Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction]] and [[Lorentz transformation]] but by hypothesizing [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] states of the aether, whereas Einstein's special relativity was simply [[kinematics|kinematic]], that is, positing no causal mechanical explanation, simply describing positions, thus showing how to align measuring devices, namely, clocks and rods.

In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently formalized [[quantum mechanics]] (QM).&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq= pp 113–18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite clashing explanations,&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=QMs&gt;Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] posed an [[electron]]'s charge smeared across space as a [[wavefunction|waveform]], later reinterpreted as the electron [[probability amplitude|manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely]] while eventually building up that deterministic waveform.  Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.  Again, we have an example of a false but empirically successful theory".&lt;/ref&gt; "relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since" 1905 brought [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;Pigliucci, ''Answers for Aristotle'' (Basic Books, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=laZensALMSgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=antirealist+aether p 119]: "But the antirealist will quickly point out that plenty of times in the past scientists have posited the existence of unobservables that were apparently necessary to explain a phenomenon, only to discover later on that such unobservables did not in fact exist.  A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.  The antirealists will relish pointing out that modern physics features a number of similarly unobservable entities, from [[quantum foam|quantum mechanical 'foam']] to [[dark energy]], and that the current crop of scientists seems just as confident about the latter two as their nineteenth-century counterparts were about aether".&lt;/ref&gt;  Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence,&lt;ref name=Tavel/&gt; simply said it superfluous.&lt;ref name=Cordero-p29-30/&gt;  Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p78-80&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt; and to explain motion was led back to aether in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Laughlin&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'' (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=ironic pp 120–21].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorentz aether theory|Lorentz aether]] was at absolute rest—acting ''on'' matter but not acted on ''by'' matter.  Replacing it and resembling [[Ernst Mach]]'s aether, Einstein aether is [[spacetime]] itself—which is the [[gravitational field]]—receiving motion from a body and transmitting it to other bodies while propagating at light speed, [[gravitational waves|waving]].  An unobservable, however, Einstein aether is not a privileged [[frame of reference|reference frame]]—is not to be assigned a state of absolute motion or absolute rest.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet resistance to [[relativity theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Relativity theory comprises both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR).  Holding for inertial reference frames, SR is as a limited case of GR, which holds for all reference frames, both inertial and accelerated.  In GR, all motion—inertial, accelerated, or gravitational—is consequent of the geometry of 3D space stretched onto the 1D axis of time.  By GR, no force distinguishes acceleration from inertia.  Inertial motion is consequence simply of ''uniform'' geometry of spacetime, acceleration is consequence simply of ''nonuniform'' geometry of spacetime, and gravitation is simply acceleration.&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote/&gt;  Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether,&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 14–18].&lt;/ref&gt; but Einstein aether, too, was opposed.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Objects became conceived as pinned directly on [[spacetime|space and time]]&lt;ref&gt;In Einstein's 4D spacetime, 3D space is stretched onto the 1D axis of time flow, which [[time dilation|slows]] while space additionally [[space contraction|contracts]] in the vicinity of mass or energy.&lt;/ref&gt; by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-p180&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, QED along with [[weak force|weak nuclear field]] was reduced to [[electroweak theory]] (EWT), and the [[strong force|strong nuclear field]] was modeled as [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Comprised by EWT, QCD, and [[Higgs field]], this [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is an "effective theory",&lt;ref&gt;As an effective field theory, once adjusted to particular domains, Standard Model is predictively accurate until a certain, vast energy scale that is a cutoff, whereupon more fundamental phenomena—regulating the effective theory's modeled phenomena—would emerge. (Burgess &amp; Moore, ''Standard Model'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLYECqs2geEC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=effective p xi]; Wells, ''Effective Theories'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKKAfrfCofcC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Natural+Standard+Model pp 55–56]).&lt;/ref&gt; not truly fundamental.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner&gt;Jegerlehner, "The Standard Model as a low-energy effective theory", [https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7813 arXiv:1304.7813]: "We understand the [[Standard Model|SM]] as a low energy effective emergence of some unknown physical system—we may call it 'ether'—which is located at the [[Planck scale]] with the [[Planck length]] as a 'microscopic' length scale.  Note that the cutoff, though very large, in any case is finite".&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[gluons|QCD's particles]] are considered nonexistent in the everyday world,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; QCD especially suggests an aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73/&gt; routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry.&lt;ref name=Laughlin-quote&gt;Laughlin, ''A Different Universe'', (Basic Books, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=djQKg_XBsLEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq= pp 120–21]: "The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity.  This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  ...  Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry.  It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.  The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.  But we do not call it this because it is taboo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirmation of the [[Higgs particle]], modeled as a condensation within the [[Higgs field]], corroborates aether,&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt; although physics need not state or even include aether.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Organizing regularities of ''observations''—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover ''aether''.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem/&gt;

In 1905, from [[special relativity]], Einstein deduced [[mass–energy equivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;Mass–energy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; particles being variant forms of distributed energy,&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA616&amp;dq=special p 13]: "[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy".&lt;/ref&gt; how [[particle accelerator|particles colliding at vast speed]] experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,&lt;ref&gt;Braibant, Giacomelli &amp; Spurio, ''Particles and Fundamental Interactions'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YUUG2pGeIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=electron+proton+neutron+collisions p 2]: "Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass".&lt;/ref&gt; although physicists' talk promotes confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]] explained, "People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it.  The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside.  Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy.  Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding [[proton]]s.  The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being" [Avent, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&amp;A"], ''Economist'', 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  As "the contemporary locus of [[metaphysical]] research", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as ''excitation modes'' of fields,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P396&amp;dq= p 396].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt; the particles and their masses being states of aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13&gt;Wilczek, [http://ctpweb.lns.mit.edu/physics_today/phystoday/Ether.pdf "The persistence of ether"], ''Phys Today'', 1999; '''52''':11,13, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,&lt;ref name=Riesselmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 "The grid (persistence of ether)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ether+QCD p 73]: "For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.  Other developments in modern physics reinforce and enrich that lesson.  Later, as we explore the current frontiers, we'll see how the concept of 'empty' space as a rich, dynamic medium empowers our best thinking about how to achieve the unification of forces".&lt;/ref&gt; as long ago foreseen.&lt;ref name=Lodge/&gt;  Yet a ''quantum'' field is an intricate abstraction—a ''mathematical'' field—virtually inconceivable as a ''classical'' field's physical properties.&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate"], ''Sci Am'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">{{short description|A measure of the relative contributions of temperature and salinity in determining the density gradient in a seawater column}}
The '''density ratio''' of a column of [[seawater]] is a measure of the relative contributions of [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] in determining the [[density]] gradient.&lt;ref&gt;You, Yuzhu. "A global ocean climatological atlas of the Turner angle: implications for double-diffusion and water-mass structure." Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 49.11 (2002): 2075-2093.&lt;/ref&gt; At a density ratio of 1, temperature and salinity are said to be ''compensated'': their density signatures cancel, leaving a density gradient of zero.  The formula for the density ratio, R, is:

R = αθ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;/βS&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, where

* θ is the [[potential temperature]]
* S is the salinity
* z is the vertical coordinate (with subscript denoting [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] by z)
* ρ is the density
* α = −ρ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;∂ρ/∂θ is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] 
* β = ρ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;∂ρ/∂S is the haline contraction coefficient

When a water column is "doubly stable"--both temperature and salinity contribute to the stable density gradient--the density ratio is negative (a doubly unstable water column would also have a negative density ratio, but does not commonly occur).  A statically stable water column with a density ratio between 0 and 1 (cool fresh overlying warm salty) can support [[diffusive convection]], and a statically stable water column with a density ratio larger than 1 can support [[salt fingering]].

Density ratio may also be used to describe thermohaline variability over a non-vertical spatial interval, such as across a [[front (oceanography)|front]] in the [[mixed layer]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick, Daniel L., and Raffaele Ferrari. "Compensation of horizontal temperature and salinity gradients in the ocean mixed layer." Science 283.5401 (1999): 526-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the signs of both the numerator and denominator are reversed, the density ratio remains unchanged. A related quantity which avoids this ambiguity as well as the infinite values possible when the denominator vanishes is the Turner angle, Tu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Turner_angle American Meteorological Society Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:18th century dowser.jpg|thumb|right|A dowser, from an 18th-century French book about superstitions]]

'''Dowsing''' is a type of [[divination]] employed in attempts to locate [[ground water]], buried metals or [[ore]]s, gemstones, [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Grave (burial)|gravesites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=William E|title=Grave Dowsing Reconsidered|url=https://archaeology.uiowa.edu/file/726/download?token=DqQdlDVi|accessdate=21 June 2017|agency=Office of the State Archaeologist|publisher=The University of Iowa|date=23 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other objects and materials without the use of scientific apparatus.  Dowsing is considered a [[pseudoscience]], and there is no [[scientific evidence]] that it is any more effective than [[random chance]].&lt;ref name="Vogt1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogt|first=Evon Z.|author2=Ray Hyman|title=Water Witching U.S.A.|publisher=Chicago University Press|location=Chicago|year=1979|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-226-86297-2}} via {{cite book|last=Hines|first=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|year=2003|edition=Second|page=420|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]]. (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood Press. pp. 55–57. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowsing is also known as '''divining''' (especially in reference to interpretation of results),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8vBAX1_UPGsC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Discovering Dowsing and Divining'', p. 5], Peter Naylor&lt;/ref&gt; '''doodlebugging'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readersandrootworkers.org/wiki/Category:Dowsing,_Doodlebugging,_and_Water_Witching|title=Dowsing, Doodlebugging, and Water Witching|work=Association of Independent Readers and Rootworkers Wiki|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=xrLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=doodlebugging+dowsing#v=onepage&amp;q=doodlebugging%20dowsing&amp;f=false | title = Keystone Folklore Quarterly | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or (when searching specifically for water) '''water finding''', '''water witching''' (in the United States) or '''water dowsing'''.

A Y-shaped twig or rod, or two L-shaped ones — individually called a '''dowsing rod''', '''divining rod''' (Latin: '''virgula divina''' or '''baculus divinatorius'''), "vining rod", or '''witching rod''' — are sometimes used during dowsing, although some dowsers use other equipment or no equipment at all.
Dowsing appears to have arisen in the context of [[Renaissance magic]] {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} in [[German Renaissance|Germany]], and it remains popular among believers in [[Forteana]] {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} or [[radiesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;As translated from one preface of the Kassel experiments, "roughly 10,000 active dowsers in Germany ''alone'' can generate a conservatively-estimated annual revenue of more than 100 million DM (US$50 million)". [http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ GWUP-Psi-Tests 2004: Keine Million Dollar für PSI-Fähigkeiten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410205142/http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ |date=April 10, 2005 }} (in German) and [http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm English version] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814114138/http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm |date=August 14, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The motion of dowsing rods is now generally attributed to the [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor response]].&lt;ref name= "Zusne 1989"&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. pp. 105–110. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Novella 2002"&gt;Novella, Steve; Deangelis, Perry. (2002). ''Dowsing''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 93–94. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}} "Despite widespread belief, careful investigation has demonstrated that the technique of dowsing simply does not work. No researcher has been able to prove under controlled conditions that dowsing has any genuine divining power... A more likely explanation for the movement of a dowser's focus is the ideomotor effect, which entails involuntary and unconscious motor behavior."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, T. J; Crane, L. L.

Dowsing as practiced today may have originated in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] during the 16th century, when it was used in attempts to find [[metal]]s.

As early as 1518 [[Martin Luther]] listed dowsing for metals as an act that broke the [[I am the Lord your God|first commandment]] (''i.e.'', as [[occultism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Decem praecepta Wittenbergensi populo praedicta'', Martin Luther&lt;/ref&gt; The 1550 edition of [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]'' contains a woodcut of a dowser with forked rod in hand walking over a cutaway image of a mining operation. The rod is labelled "Virgula Divina – Glück rüt" (Latin: divine rod; German "Wünschelrute": fortune rod or stick), but there is no text accompanying the woodcut. By 1556 [[Georgius Agricola]]'s treatment of mining and smelting of ore, ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', included a detailed description of dowsing for metal ore.&lt;ref&gt;William Barrett and [[Theodore Besterman]]. ''The Divining Rod: An Experimental and Psychological Investigation.'' (1926) Kessinger Publishing, 2004: p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...There are many great contentions between miners concerning the forked twig, for some say that it is of the greatest use in discovering veins, and others deny it. ... All alike grasp the forks of the twig with their hands, clenching their fists, it being necessary that the clenched fingers should be held toward the sky in order that the twig should be raised at that end where the two branches meet. Then they wander hither and thither at random through mountainous regions. It is said that the moment they place their feet on a vein the twig immediately turns and twists, and so by its action discloses the vein ; when they move their feet again and go away from that spot the twig becomes once more immobile. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agricola|first1=Georgius|title=De Re Metallica|date=1556|location=Basel|page=38ff|edition=tr.

In the sixteenth century, German deep mining technology was in enormous demand all over Europe. [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon#Early modern period|German miners]] were licensed to live and work in [[Elizabethan England]];&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1215&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[Stannaries]] of [[Devon]] &amp; [[Cornwall]] and in [[Cumbria]]. In other parts of England, the technique was used in Elizabeth's royal mines  for [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]]. By 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales.&lt;ref name = JWG&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gough|first1=John Weidhofft|title=The Mines of Mendip|date=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|oclc=163035417|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-mining area of the [[Mendip Hills]] in Somerset in the 17th century the natural philosopher [[Robert Boyle]], inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a  practitioner try to find "latent veins of metals". Boyle saw the hazel divining rod ("virgula divinatoria") stoop in the hands of the diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man's genuine belief  but himself remained unconvinced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Robert|year=1661|title=Works|volume=One|publisher=[[Thomas Birch]]|pages=342–3|edition=1743|chapter=On Unsucceeding Experiments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dowsing in search of water is considered an ancient practice by some, old texts about searching for water do not mention using the divining rod, and the first account of this practice was in 1568.&lt;ref name="spooky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Sharon A. |author-link=Sharon A.

[[William F. Barrett|Sir William F. Barrett]] wrote in his 1911 book ''Psychical Research'' that: 
{{quote|...in a recent admirable Life of St. Teresa of Spain, the following incident is narrated: Teresa in 1568 was offered the site for a convent to which there was only one objection, there was no water supply; happily, a Friar Antonio came up with a twig in his hand, stopped at a certain spot and appeared to be making the sign of the cross; but Teresa says, "Really I cannot be sure if it were the sign he made, at any rate he made some movement with the twig and then he said, ' Dig just here ' ; they dug, and lo ! a plentiful fount of water gushed forth, excellent for 'drinking, copious for washing, and it never ran dry.' " As the writer of this Life remarks : " Teresa, not having heard of dowsing, has no explanation for this event," and regarded it as a miracle. This, I believe, is the first historical reference to dowsing for water.&lt;ref name="Barrett_Psychical Research_p171"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=William|title=Psychical Research|date=1911|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.

In 1662, dowsing was declared to be "superstitious, or rather [[satan]]ic" by a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Gaspar Schott]], though he later noted that he wasn't sure that the devil was always responsible for the movement of the rod.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], ''De La Baguette Divinatoire du pendule dit explorateur at des table tournants au point de vue de l'histoire, de la critique, and de la méthode expérimentale'', Paris, 1854. "''Le père Gaspard Schott (jés.) considère l'usage de la baguette comme superstitieux ou plutôt diabolique, mais des renseignements qui lui furent donnés plus tard par des hommes qu'il considérait comme religieux et probe, lui firent dire dans une notation à ce passage, qu'il ne voudrait pas assurer que le demon fait toujours ''tourner'' la baguette.''" (''Physica Curiosa'', 1662, lib. XII, cap. IV, pag. 1527). See [https://books.google.com/books?id=kzsAAAAAQAAJ facsimile] on [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the South of France in the 17th century it was used in tracking criminals and [[heresy|heretics]]. Its abuse led to a decree of the inquisition in 1701, forbidding its employment for purposes of justice.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Divining-rod |volume=8 |pages=333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[epigram]] by Samuel Sheppard, from ''Epigrams theological, philosophical, and romantick'' (1651) runs thus:

:''Virgula divina''.
:"Some Sorcerers do boast they have a Rod,
:Gather'd with Vowes and Sacrifice,
:And (borne about) will strangely nod
:To hidden Treasure where it lies;
:Mankind is (sure) that Rod divine,
:For to the Wealthiest (ever) they incline."

Early attempts at an explanation of dowsing were based on the notion that the divining rod was physically affected by emanations from substances of interest. The following explanation is from [[William Pryce]]'s 1778 ''Mineralogia Cornubiensis'':

{{quote|The corpuscles... that rise from the Minerals, entering the rod, determine it to bow down, in order to render it parallel to the vertical lines which the effluvia describe in their rise. In effect the Mineral particles seem to be emitted from the earth; now the Virgula [rod], being of a light porous wood, gives an easy passage to these particles, which are also very fine and subtle; the effluvia then driven forwards by those that follow them, and pressed at the same time by the atmosphere incumbent on them, are forced to enter the little interstices between the fibres of the wood, and by that effort they oblige it to incline, or dip down perpendicularly, to become parallel with the little columns which those vapours form in their rise.}}

A study towards the end of the nineteenth century concluded that the phenomenon was attributed to cryptesthesia, whereby the practitioner made unconscious observations of the terrain  and involuntarily influenced the movement of the rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pass|first1=A.C.|last2=Tawney|first2=Edward. B.|title=The divining rod|journal=Proceedings|date=1876|volume=I|pages=60 et seq|publisher=[[Bristol Naturalists' Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowsing was conducted in South Dakota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to help homesteaders, farmers, and ranchers locate water wells on their property.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Fairchild and Walker D. Wyman, Frontier Woman: The Life of a Woman Homesteader on the Dakota Frontier (River Falls: University of Wisconsin-River Falls Press, 1972), 50; Robert Amerson, From the Hidewood: Memories of a Dakota Neighborhood (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1996), 290–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-Rods===
[[File:Agriculture in Britain- Life on George Casely's Farm, Devon, England, 1942 D9817.jpg|thumb|right|1942: George Casely uses a hazel twig to attempt to find water on the land around his Devon farm]]
Traditionally, the most common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer branches from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. [[Hazel]] twigs in Europe and [[witch-hazel]] in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from [[willow]] or [[Peach|peach trees]]. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod is expected to dip, incline or twitch when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as "willow witching".

===L-Rods===
[[File:Allemanswiro.jpg|thumb|left|Two L-shaped metal wire rods]]
Many dowsers today use a pair of simple L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm pointing forward. When something is "found", the rods cross over one another. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods may be fashioned from wire coat hangers or wire flags used for locating utilities. Glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century [[New England]].

===Kassel 1991 study===
A 1990 [[double-blind]] study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ GWUP-Psi-Tests 2004: Keine Million Dollar für PSI-Fähigkeiten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410205142/http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ |date=April 10, 2005 }} (in German) and [http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm English version] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814114138/http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm |date=August 14, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotech1.com/cgi-bin/pages/common/index.pl?page=lrl&amp;file=info/kassel/kassel1.dat The Kassel Dowsing Test – Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotech1.com/cgi-bin/pages/common/index.pl?page=lrl&amp;file=info/kassel/kassel2.dat The Kassel Dowsing Test – Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken in [[Kassel]], Germany, under the direction of the ''[[Gesellschaft zur Wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften]]'' (Society for the Scientific Investigation of the Parasciences). [[James Randi]] offered a US$10,000 prize to any successful dowser. The three-day test of some 30 dowsers involved plastic pipes through which water flow could be controlled and directed. The pipes were buried {{convert|50|cm|in|1|sp=us|lk=on}} under a level field, the position of each marked on the surface with a colored strip. The dowsers had to tell whether water was running through each pipe. All the dowsers signed a statement agreeing this was a fair test of their abilities and that they expected a 100 percent success rate. However, the results were no better than chance, thus no one was awarded the prize.

===Betz 1990 study===
In a 1987–88 study in Munich by [[Hans-Dieter Betz]] and other scientists, 500 dowsers were initially tested for their skill, and the experimenters selected the best 43 among them for further tests. Water was pumped through a pipe on the ground floor of a two-storey barn. Before each test, the pipe was moved in a direction perpendicular to the water flow. On the upper floor, each dowser was asked to determine the position of the pipe. Over two years, the dowsers performed 843 such tests and, of the 43 pre-selected and extensively tested candidates, at least 37 showed no dowsing ability. The results from the remaining 6 were said to be better than chance, resulting in the experimenters' conclusion that some dowsers "in particular tasks, showed an extraordinarily high rate of success, which can scarcely if at all be explained as due to chance&amp;nbsp;... a real core of dowser-phenomena can be regarded as empirically proven."&lt;ref name=munich_study_quote&gt;Wagner, H., H.-D. Betz, and H. L. König, 1990. Schlußbericht 01 KB8602, Bundesministerium für Forschung und Technologie. [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/testing_dowsing_the_failure_of_the_munich_experiments/ As quoted by Jim T. Enright] in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after the Munich study was published, [[Jim T. Enright]], a professor of physiology who emphasised correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study's results are merely consistent with [[statistical fluctuations]] and not significant. He believed the experiments provided "the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim",&lt;ref name="enright"&gt;{{cite web

Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; if they only afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method.

Science writers such as [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] (1877), [[Millais Culpin]] (1920) and [[Martin Gardner]] (1957) considered the movement of dowsing rods to be the result of [[Ideomotor phenomenon|unconscious muscular action]] &lt;ref&gt;[[William Benjamin Carpenter|Carpenter, William Benjamin]].

It is the change in balance between opposing sets of muscles in the arms (flexors and extensors) that makes the rods move.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dowsing apparatus is known to amplify slight movements of the hands caused by a phenomenon known as the ideomotor response: people's subconscious minds may influence their bodies without consciously deciding to take action. This would make the dowsing rod susceptible to the dowsers's subconscious knowledge or perception; but also to [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref name="Zusne 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, R; Vogt, E. Z.

Psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] in a 1986 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' included dowsing in a list of "effects which until recently were claimed to be paranormal but which can now be explained from within orthodox science."&lt;ref name="marks1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marks|first=David F.|authorlink= David Marks (psychologist)|date=March 13, 1986|title=Investigating the paranormal|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|volume=320|pages=119–124|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/320119a0|pmid=3951553|issue=6058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, dowsing could be explained in terms of [[sensory cue]]s, [[Observer-expectancy effect|expectancy effects]] and [[probability]].&lt;ref name="marks1986" /&gt;

Science writer [[Peter Daempfle]] has noted that when dowsing is subjected to scientific testing, it fails. Daempfle has written that although some dowsers claim success, this can be attributed to the underground [[water table]] being distributed relatively uniformly in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Daempfle|Daempfle, Peter]].

In regard to dowsing and its use in archaeology, [[Kenneth Feder]] has written that "the vast majority of archaeologists don't use dowsing, because they don't believe it works."&lt;ref name="Feder 2010"/&gt;

Psychologist [[Chris French]] has noted that "dowsing does not work when it is tested under properly controlled conditions that rule out the use of other cues to indicate target location."&lt;ref name="French 2013"/&gt;

A report in [[The Guardian]] on the subject of British water company employees using dowsing, including from Anglian and Severn Trent, noted that "The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. [[Ofwat]] said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty." Anglian Water also attested to "the effectiveness of dowsing rods".&lt;ref name="guardian2017"/&gt;
A similar report from the [[BBC]] noted "All the companies emphasised they do not encourage the use of divining rods nor issue them to engineers, and said modern methods such as drones and listening devices were preferred."&lt;ref name="bbc2017"/&gt;

(Myron Wyn) 1950-}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed to unify [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2006a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2006b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was largely published in the journal ''[[Foundations of Physics Letters]]'' between 2003 and 2005.  Several of Evans' central claims were later shown to be mathematically incorrect{{sfn|Trovon De Carvalho|Rodrigues|2001}}{{sfn|Rodrigues|Souza|2005}}{{sfn|Bruhn|2008}}{{sfn|Bruhn|Hehl|Jadczyk|2008}} and, in 2008, the new editor of ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'', [[Nobel laureate]] [[Gerard 't Hooft]], published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis.{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

==Scope==
Earlier versions of the theory were called "[[O(3)]] [[electrodynamics]]". Evans claims that he is able to derive a generally covariant field equation for electromagnetism and gravity, similar to that derived by [[Mendel Sachs]].{{sfn|Evans|2003a}}

Evans argues that Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] does not take into account [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], which is included in the [[Einstein–Cartan theory]].{{sfn|Evans|2004a}}

In 1998 Evans founded the Alpha Institute for Advanced Studies (AIAS) to keep developing his theory. Its website collects papers on the theory and recent developments.&lt;ref name=AIAS/&gt;

The theory has been used to justify the [[motionless electromagnetic generator]], a [[perpetual motion machine]].{{sfn|Anastasovski et al.|2001}} In July 2017, Evans claimed (on his blog): "There is immediate international interest in [papers] UFT382 and UFT383, describing the new energy from spacetime (ES) circuits. There is also great interest in UFT364, the paper that describes the circuit [...] These circuits should be [...] developed into power stations." In November 2017, Evans expanded on this point, as follows (again on his blog): "There is no reasonable doubt that the vacuum (or aether or spacetime) contains a source of inexhaustible, safe and clean energy. This source can be used in patented and replicated circuits such as those of [Evans' self-published papers] UFT311, UFT364, UFT382, and UFT383."

==Reception==
Evans' claims are not accepted by the mainstream physics community. In an editorial note in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' the [[Nobel laureate]] [[Gerard 't Hooft]] discussed the "revolutionary paradigm switch in theoretical physics" promised by ECE theory. He concluded that activities in the subject "have remained limited to personal web pages and are absent from the standard electronic archives, while no reference to ECE theory can be spotted in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals".{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

Several of the published contributions in this theory have been shown to be mathematically incorrect.{{sfn|Trovon De Carvalho|Rodrigues|2001}}{{sfn|Rodrigues|Souza|2005}}{{sfn|Bruhn|2008}}{{sfn|Bruhn|Hehl|Jadczyk|2008}} In response to these demonstrations, 't Hooft's editorial note concludes, "Taking into account the findings of Bruhn, Hehl and Obukhhov, the discussion of ECE theory in the journal ''Foundations of Physics'' will be concluded herewith unless very good arguments are presented to resume the matter."{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

[[File:Fotografi av Conte Mattei - Hallwylska museet - 103008.tif|thumb|Count Cesare Mattei]]
'''Electrohomoeopathy''' (or '''Mattei cancer cure''') is a derivative of [[homeopathy]] invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of ''electro'' (referring to an electric [[energy (esotericism)|bio-energy]] content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than [[electricity]] in its conventional sense) and ''homeopathy'' (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturowatch.org/hx/fishbein.html|title=Naturopathy and Its Professors (1932)|work=naturowatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucrative for its inventor and popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomoeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy". Like all homeopathy, it is regarded by the [[modern medicine|medical]] and [[scientific community|scientific communities]] as [[pseudoscience]] and its practice as [[quackery]].

==History and criticism==
Electrohomeopathy was devised by Cesare Mattei (1809–1896) in the latter part of the 19th century. Mattei, a nobleman living in a castle in the vicinity of [[Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaplease.it/eng/megazine/giroditalia/rocchetta|title=Arabian Nights in the Apennines|work=italiaplease.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied natural science, anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry and botany. He ultimately focused on the supposed therapeutic power of "electricity" in botanical extracts. Mattei made bold, unsupported claims for the efficacy of his treatments, including the claim that his treatments offered a nonsurgical alternative to [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciper.org/print/RR1-3-1-3.html|title=Science in the 19th Century Periodical|work=sciper.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment regimens were met with scepticism by mainstream medicine:&lt;blockquote&gt;The electrohomeopathic system is an invention of Count Mattei who prates of "red", "yellow" and "blue", "green" and "white" electricity, a theory that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a large fortune for its chief promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692368|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–48|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|pmid=18340885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notwithstanding criticisms, including a challenge by the British medical establishment to the claimed success of his cancer treatments,&lt;ref&gt;GW Potter, "Matteism: An Exposure", ''[[British Medical Journal|British Med J]]'', 13 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; electrohomeopathy (or Matteism, as it was sometimes known at the time) had adherents in Germany, France, the USA and the UK by the beginning of the 20th century; electrohomeopathy had been the subject of approximately 100 publications and there were three journals dedicated to it.&lt;ref name=baylen&gt;{{cite journal
|first=J. O
|last=Baylen
|title=The Mattei cancer cure: a Victorian nostrum
|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society
|year=1969
|volume=7
|issue=169
|page=397
|jstor=1624730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Remedies are derived from what are said to be the active micro nutrients or mineral salts of certain plants. One contemporary account of the process of producing electrohomeopathic remedies was as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the nature of his remedies we learn ... that ... they are manufactured from certain herbs, and that the directions for the preparation of the necessary dilutions are given in the ordinary jargon of homeopathy. The globules and liquids, however, are "instinct with a potent, vital, electrical force, which enables them to work wonders". This process of "fixing the electrical principle" is carried on in the secret central chamber of a Neo-[[Moorish]] castle which Count Mattei has built for himself in the Bolognese [[Apennines]] ... The "red electricity" and "white electricity" supposed to be "fixed" in these "vegetable compounds" are in their very nomenclature and suggestion poor and miserable fictions.&lt;ref&gt;The Mattei Fable, ''British Med J'' Jan 17, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mattei's own ideas however, every disease originates in the change of [[blood]] or of the [[lymphatic system]] or both, and remedies can therefore be mainly divided into two broad categories to be used in response to the dominant affected system. Mattei wrote that having obtained plant extracts, he was "able to determine in the liquid vegetable electricity". Allied to his theories and therapies were elements of Chinese medicine, of medical [[humours]], of apparent Brownianism, as well as modified versions of [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s homeopathic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Lodispoto, 'L'Electromiopathie du Comte Cesare Mattei', ''Zeitschrift für Klassische Homöopathie'' (English abstract) 1971; 15: 130-135&lt;/ref&gt; Electrohomeopathy has some associations with [[Spagyric medicine]], a [[holistic]] medical philosophy claimed to be the practical application of alchemy in medical treatment, so that the principle of modern electrohomeopathy is that disease is typically multi-organic in cause or effect and therefore requires holistic treatment that is at once both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Modern usage==
A symposium took place in Bologna in 2008 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cesare Mattei,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesaremattei.com cesaremattei.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with attendees from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Germany]], UK, and the USA. Electrohomeopathy is practiced predominantly in India and Pakistan (RAJYA SABHA Parliamentary Bulletin- The Recognition of Electro Homeopathy System of Medicine Bill,
2015 by E. M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, M. P),&lt;ref&gt;The Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Research Desk) orders no. R14015/25/96-U&amp;H (R) (Pt.), 25 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but there are also a number of electrohomeopathy organizations and institutions worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10569">An '''electronic lab notebook''' (also known as '''electronic laboratory notebook''', or '''ELN''') is a [[computer program]] designed to replace paper [[lab notebook|laboratory notebook]]s.  Lab notebooks in general are used by [[scientist]]s, [[engineer]]s, and [[technician]]s to document [[research]], [[experiment]]s, and procedures performed in a laboratory.  A lab notebook is often maintained to be a [[legal document]] and may be used in a [[court of law]] as [[evidence (law)|evidence]].  Similar to an [[inventor's notebook]], the lab notebook is also often referred to in [[patent]] prosecution and [[intellectual property]] [[litigation]].

Electronic lab notebooks are a fairly new technology and offer many benefits to the user as well as organizations. For example: electronic lab notebooks are easier to search upon, simplify data copying and backups, and support collaboration amongst many users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |

ELNs can have fine-grained access controls, and can be more secure than their paper counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also allow the direct incorporation of data from instruments, replacing the practice of printing out data to be stapled into a paper notebook.&lt;ref name="Perkel2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Perkel | first1 = J. M. | title = Coding your way out of a problem | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 541–543 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21716280 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
ELNs can be divided into two categories:

* "Specific ELNs" contain features designed to work with specific applications, scientific instrumentation or data types.
* "[[Cross-disciplinary]] ELNs" or "Generic ELNs" are designed to support access to all data and information that needs to be recorded in a lab notebook.

Solutions range from specialized programs designed from the ground up for use as an ELN, to modifications or direct use of more general programs.  Examples of using more general software include using [[OpenWetWare]], a [[MediaWiki]] install (running the same software that Wikipedia uses), as an ELN, or the use of general note taking software such as OneNote as an ELN.&lt;ref name="Perkel2011"/&gt;

ELN's come in many different forms. They can be standalone programs, use a client-server model, or be entirely web-based. Some use a lab-notebook approach, others resemble a blog.

A good many variations on the "ELN" acronym have appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labii.com/|title=Labii ELN &amp; LIMS|date=2017-04-30|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-30}}{{Cite web|url=http://cerf-notebook.com/articles/eln-glossary/|title=Lab Notebook (ELN) Glossary - CERF|date=2016-02-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between systems with different names are often subtle, with considerable functional overlap between them. Examples include "ERN" (Electronic Research Notebook), "ERMS" (Electronic Resource (or Research or Records) Management System (or Software) and SDMS (Scientific Data (or Document) Management System (or Software). Ultimately, these types of systems all strive to do the same thing: Capture, record, centralize and protect scientific data in a way that is highly searchable, historically accurate, and legally stringent, and which also promotes secure collaboration, greater efficiency, reduced mistakes and lowered total research costs.

==Objectives==
A good electronic laboratory notebook should offer a secure environment to protect the integrity of both data and process, whilst also affording the flexibility to adopt new processes or changes to existing processes without recourse to further software development. The package architecture should be a modular design, so as to offer the benefit of minimizing validation costs of any subsequent changes that you may wish to make in the future as your needs change.

A good electronic laboratory notebook should be an "out of the box" solution that, as standard, has fully configurable forms to comply with the requirements of regulated analytical groups through to a sophisticated ELN for inclusion of structures, spectra, chromatograms, pictures, text, etc. where a preconfigured form is less appropriate. All data within the system may be stored in a database (e.g. MySQL, MS-SQL, Oracle) and be fully searchable. The system should enable data to be collected, stored and retrieved through any combination of forms or ELN that best meets the requirements of the user.

The application should enable secure forms to be generated that accept laboratory data input via PCs and/or laptops / palmtops, and should be directly linked to electronic devices such as laboratory balances, pH meters, etc.  Networked or wireless communications should be accommodated for by the package which will allow data to be interrogated, tabulated, checked, approved, stored and archived to comply with the latest regulatory guidance and legislation.  A system should also include a scheduling option for routine procedures such as equipment qualification and study related timelines. It should include configurable qualification requirements to automatically verify that instruments have been cleaned and calibrated within a specified time period, that reagents have been quality-checked and have not expired, and that workers are trained and authorized to use the equipment and perform the procedures.

==Regulatory and legal aspects==
The laboratory accreditation criteria found in the [[ISO 17025]] standard needs to be considered for the protection and computer backup of electronic records. These criteria can be found specifically in clause 4.13.1.4 of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;"ISO/IEC 17025:2005 - General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories." ISO - International Organization for Standardization. Web. 16 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.iso.org/iso/Catalogue_detail?csnumber=39883&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic lab notebooks used for development or research in regulated industries, such as medical devices or pharmaceuticals, are expected to comply with FDA regulations related to software validation.  The purpose of the regulations is to ensure the integrity of the entries in terms of time, authorship, and content.  Unlike ELNs for patent protection, FDA is not concerned with patent interference proceedings, but is concerned with avoidance of falsification.  Typical provisions related to software validation are included in the medical device regulations at 21 CFR 820 (et seq.)&lt;ref&gt;United States. Food and Drug Administration. Department of Health and Human Resources. 1 Food and Drugs - Subchapter H Medical Devices - Part 820 System RegCode of Federal Regulations - Title 2ulation. FDA.gov, 7 Oct. 1996. Web. &lt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=820&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Title 21 CFR Part 11]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Food and Drug Administration. Department of Health and Human Resources. Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21 Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures. FDA.gov. Authority: 21 U.S.C. 321-393; 42 U.S.C. 262., 20 Mar. 1997. Web. 16 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=11&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, the requirements are that the software has been designed and implemented to be suitable for its intended purposes.  Evidence to show that this is the case is often provided by a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) setting forth the intended uses and the needs that the ELN will meet; one or more testing protocols that, when followed, demonstrate that the ELN meets the requirements of the specification and that the requirements are satisfied under worst-case conditions.  Security, audit trails, prevention of unauthorized changes without substantial collusion of otherwise independent personnel (i.e., those having no interest in the content of the ELN such as independent quality unit personnel) and similar tests are fundamental.  Finally, one or more reports demonstrating the results of the testing in accordance with the predefined protocols are required prior to release of the ELN software for use.  If the reports show that the software failed to satisfy any of the SRS requirements, then corrective and preventive action ("CAPA") must be undertaken and documented.  Such CAPA may extend to minor software revisions, or changes in architecture or major revisions.  CAPA activities need to be documented as well.

Aside from the requirements to follow such steps for regulated industry, such an approach is generally a good practice in terms of development and release of any software to assure its quality and fitness for use.  There are standards related to software development and testing that can be applied (see ref.).

'''Faith healing''' is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as [[laying on of hands]]) that are believed by some to elicit [[miracle|divine intervention]] in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faith healing|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp#F|website=thearda.com|location=University Park, PA|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=2015-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101012004/http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp|archivedate=2016-01-01|deadurl=no}} Citing {{cite encyclopedia|year=1995|title=|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=William Scott|encyclopedia=The Harper Collins Dictionary of Religion|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a [[divine presence]] and power.

Many people interpret the Bible, especially the [[New Testament]], as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease.&lt;ref name="Kalb2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalb|first=Claudia|date=2004-11-10|title=Can religion improve health?

[[File:Fallerjfa.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by Fr. Joey Faller, Pulilan, Bulacan, Philippines]]
[[File:FvfFaithhealing6177 15.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by [[Fernando Suarez]], Philippines]] 
Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], faith healing often involves the [[laying on of hands]]. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including [[Elijah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Village" /&gt;

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{cite book |first= Reginald B. |last= Cherry |title= The Bible Cure |publisher= HarperOne |year= 1999 |origyear= 1998 |edition= reprint |isbn= 0062516159}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Citing: {{Bibleref2|John|9:1–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:46–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=32}} Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves, Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Wilfred, Jr. |last= Graves |authorlink= Wilfred Graves, Jr. |title= In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person |page= 52 |location= Shippensburg, PA |publisher= Destiny Image |isbn= 9780768437942}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:17|NIV}}, after describing [[Jesus exorcising at sunset]] and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|53:5|NIV}}: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. "[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are."&lt;ref name="Charisma1"&gt;{{cite news |first= Larry |last= Keefauver |title= The myths of faith healing |date= June 17, 2009 |url= http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |magazine= [[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511085525/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |archivedate= 2009-05-11|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes.  "Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to 'hold on to your miracle' will not cause your healing to manifest now."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt; Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. "The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt;

====New Testament====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
Parts of the four [[gospel]]s in the [[New Testament]] say that [[Jesus]] cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. One example is the case of "a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:26–27}} After healing her, Jesus tells her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:34|GW}} At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:52}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:10}}.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37), who "bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, "And who is my neighbor?" in verse 29) to "go, and do likewise" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thefaithfulword.org/faithhealing.html |title= Faith Healing – God's Compassion, God's Power, and God's Sovereignty: Is a Christian permitted to seek medical assistance and to use medicine? |date= December 16, 2003 |first= Craig W. |last= Booth |accessdate= 2007-05-01 |work= thefaithfulword.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a "sign"{{Bibleref2c|John|6:2}} to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ.{{Bibleref2c|John|4:48}} However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38-42}} but granted others{{Bibleref2c|Luke|9:38–43}} in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed ''all'' who were present every single time.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=61}} Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}}

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to "cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|10:8}}{{Bibleref2c|Mark|16:17–18}}

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: "Do not tell anyone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:4}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|9:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|5:43}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:36}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|8:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|9:9}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a "wicked and adulterous generation."{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–39}}

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]],{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:9||1 Corinthians 12:9}} and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Price |first= Charles P. |url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |chapter= Faith Healing |title= Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. |year= 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpJ3YJj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |archivedate= 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament [[Epistle of James]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|James|5:14}} the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus' [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles.

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age. as in Mt 12.28.

[[File:RichardRossiHealingService.JPG|right|thumb|[[Richard Rossi]] prays for the sick at one of his faith healing services, September, 1990.]]At the beginning of the 20th century, the new [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement drew participants from the [[Holiness movement]] and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in a Bible school conducted by [[Charles Fox Parham]], a holiness teacher and former [[Methodist]] pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in [[Los Angeles]] led by [[William Joseph Seymour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Synan |first= Vinson |title= The Origins of the Pentecostal Movement |url= http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/library/holyspirit/pentorg1.html |publisher= Holy Spirit Research Center, Oral Roberts University |date= 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smith Wigglesworth]] was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned [[evangelism|evangelist]] who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Sarah |last1=Posner |first2= Joe |last2= Conason |title= God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters |publisher= Polipoint Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 0979482216 |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, [[William M. Branham]] has been credited as the initiater of the post-World War II [[healing revival]]s.&lt;ref name="Anderson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first= Allan|year=2004|title=An introduction to Pentecostalism: global charismatic Christianity|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521532808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPbPTOi0Rk4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=58}}&lt;ref name="Harrell1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrell|first=David E.|year=1975|title=All things are possible: the healing and charismatic revivals in modern America|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253100900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks-Sa1mSnI8C&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=25}} The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers.

*healing by divine grace "interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] and [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|anointing with oil]] or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an [[Intercession of saints|appeal to the saints for their aid]]"&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=n2}}

In 2000, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued "Instruction on prayers for healing" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing,&lt;ref name="CDF2000"/&gt; which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.&lt;ref name="Ascoli2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascoli|first=Micol|year=2009|chapter=Psychotherapy or religious healing? : the 'therapeutic' cult of charismatic Catholics in Italy|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Su9Zhe3HglsC&amp;pg=PA229|editor1-last=Incayawar|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Wintrob|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Bouchard|editor3-first=Lise|title=Psychiatrist and traditional healers : unwitting partners in global mental health|series=WPA series, evidence and experience in psychiatry|location=Hoboken, NJ|publisher=J.

It accepts "that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science,"&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=n6}}{{efn|According to a ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article about [[psychotherapy]] from 1911, the application of scientific principles has probably been the responsible cause of more faith cures than anything else. Faith in a [[scientific discovery]] acts through the mind of a patient to bring about an improvement of symptoms, if not a cure of the disease. The patients who are cured usually suffer from [[chronic condition]]s, they either have only a [[persuasion]] that they are ill or have some physical ailment, but the patients inhibit through {{linktext|solicitude}} and worry the natural forces that would bring about a cure. This inhibition cannot be lifted until the mind is relieved by confidence in a remedy or scientific discovery that gives them a conviction of cure.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}} but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=nn11–12}}

Faith healing is reported by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the result of [[intercessory prayer]] to a [[saint]] or to a person with the gift of healing. According to ''U.S. Catholic'' magazine, "Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible." Three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for miracles.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite news |first= Leslie |last= Scanlon |title= It's a miracle! |magazine= U.S. Catholic |date= June 2009 |volume= 74 |issue= 6 |page= 12 |url= http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/05/its-miracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, "The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation,' or a sign of the kingdom that is coming." Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt;

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|title=Vatican tightens rules on miracles and money in sainthood cases|date=2016-09-23|work=Crux|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.&lt;ref name=Pinches&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pinches |first= Charles |title= Miracles: A Christian theological overview |journal= [[Southern Medical Journal]] |year= 2007 |volume= 100 |issue= 12 |pages= 1236–42 |pmid= 18090969 |doi= 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31815843cd |url= http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Fulltext/2007/12000/Miracles__A_Christian_Theological_Overview.17.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', it is often said that cures at [[shrine]]s and during [[Christian pilgrimage]]s are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in [[Divine providence]], and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|title=Psychotherapy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12549a.htm|first=James J.|last=Walsh|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A pre-1911 analysis of the records of cures shows that the majority of accepted cures have been in patients suffering from demonstrable physical conditions.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}}

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in [[France]] and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to [[Saint Jude]], who is known as the "[[patron saint]] of lost causes".

====Christian Science====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[Christian Science]] claims that healing is possible through an understanding of the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; The world as humanly perceived is believed to be a distortion of spiritual reality.

While Christian Scientists are under no compulsion to choose prayer in preference to material medicine, they normally choose not to combine the two, in the belief that they tend to work against each other if used simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= MBE [Mary Baker Eddy] |url= http://www.christianscience.org/index.php/questions-and-answers/76-is-there-no-intercessory-prayer |title= Is there no intercessory prayer? |date= June 29, 2012 |series= Study Tools |work= christianscience.org |publisher= Healing Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An important point in Christian Science is that effectual prayer and the moral regeneration of one's life go hand-in-hand: that "signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin, to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world."{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Medicine" p. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?q=SH%20150:4-150:17 150]}} Christian Science teaches that disease is mental, a mortal fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and power of ill-health – an ignorance of God's power and goodness. The chapter "Prayer" in ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' gives a full account of healing through prayer, while the testimonies at the end of the book are written by people who believe they have been healed through spiritual understanding gained from reading the book.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Brandon J. |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= I needed a blessing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Ensign) |date= September 2001 |pages= 64–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ribeiro |first= Sérgio |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2004/01/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= He restoreth my soul |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2004 |pages= 70–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Heal |first= Simon |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2010/04/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= Call an ambulance! |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= April 2010 |pages= 60–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Peñate de Guerra |first= Magdalena |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2005/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= We rejoiced in her healing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= September 2005 |pages= 66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes healings come most often as a result of [[priesthood blessing]]s given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |title= Joseph Smith/Healings and miracles |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |work= fairmormon.org |date= May 23, 2010 |accessdate= 2010-09-20 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201100307/http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.josephsmith.net/josephsmith/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=041579179acbff00VgnVCM1000001f5e340aRCRD&amp;locale=0 |title= Joseph Smith: Prophet of God |work= Josephsmith.net |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS)}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood authority]] to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. [[Brigham Young]] stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young, Brigham|1997|loc= Chapter 34: "Strengthening the Saints Through the Gifts of the Spirit."

{{disputed section|date=April 2016}}
Konkhogin Haokip has claimed some [[Muslim]]s believe that the [[Quran]] was sent not only as a revelation, but as a medicine, and that they believe the Quran heals any physical and spiritual ailments through such practices as
* Reciting the Quran over water or olive oil and drinking, bathing or anointing oneself with it.
* Placing the right hand on a place that is in pain, or placing the right hand on the forehead and reciting ''[[Al-Fatiha|Sura Al-Fatiha]]''. These methods are referred to as ''ruqyah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Increasing Knowledge about Divine Healing Within the Leadership of an Immigrant Asian Baptist Church|last=Haokip|first=Konkhogin (Hagin)|publisher=ProQuest|year=2007|isbn=9781109065787|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0vcxUctPta8C&amp;pg=PA53 53–4]}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2013-11-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology===
Some critics of [[Scientology]] have referred to some of its practices as being similar to faith healing, based on claims made by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and other writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Paulette|title=The Scandal of Scientology|url=http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/tsos/sos-21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all{{efn|name="All"}} scientists dismiss faith healing as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=Pigliucci-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassani-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Contact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="See-more-pseudo"/&gt; Some opponents of the pseudoscience label assert that faith healing makes no scientific claims and thus should be treated as a matter of faith that is not testable by science.&lt;ref name="Patheos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Delusions III: Faith Healing|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2006/09/popular-delusions-iii/|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=26 September 2006|quote=Naturally, this result has provoked bitter complaints from many believers who assert that God should not be put to the test. In response to the MANTRA study, an English bishop said, "Prayer is not a penny in the slot machine. You can't just put in a coin and get out a chocolate bar." Similarly, in a ''New York Times'' article on prayer studies from October 10, 2004, Rev. Raymond J. Lawrence Jr. of New York-Presbyterian Hospital is quoted as saying, "There's no way to put God to the test, and that's exactly what you're doing when you design a study to see if God answers your prayers.

A review in 1954 investigated [[energy medicine|spiritual healing]], [[therapeutic touch]] and faith healing. Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Louis |last= Rose |title= Some aspects of paranormal healing |journal= [[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]] |volume= 2 |issue= 4900 |year= 1954 |pages= 1329–32 |pmid= 13209112 |pmc= 2080217 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.4900.1329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, at least one study has suggested that adult Christian Scientists, who generally use prayer rather than medical care, have a higher death rate than other people of the same age.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient’s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalmri.org/index.php/about Global Medical Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

Skeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.{{efn|"Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."

These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite book |last= Park |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L.

Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

According to the [[American Cancer Society]]:
{{quote|... available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments... One review published in 1998 looked at 172 cases of deaths among children treated by faith healing instead of conventional methods. These researchers estimated that if conventional treatment had been given, the survival rate for most of these children would have been more than 90 percent, with the remainder of the children also having a good chance of survival. A more recent study found that more than 200 children had died of treatable illnesses in the United States over the past thirty years because their parents relied on spiritual healing rather than conventional medical treatment.}}

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques.{{efn|"Faith healing can cause patients to shun effective medical care." Bruce Flamm&lt;ref name='SRAM_Flamm'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inherent Dangers of Faith Healing Studies|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|date=2004|first=Bruce L.|last=Flamm|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|accessdate=2008-01-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816154915/http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|archivedate=2007-08-16|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"It is often claimed that faith healing may not work but at least does no harm.

And they may very well take them away from legitimate treatments that could really help them." [[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children&lt;ref name="AsserSwan1998"/&gt; and in reduced life expectancy for adults.&lt;ref name='JAMA longevity' /&gt; Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled "healings", where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt;{{efn|"These [discarded medications] are substances without which those people might well die."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 25, 2011|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|title=Church tells HIV patients to stop treatment|first=Liz|last=Lane|publisher=[[Sky News]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145744/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|archivedate=November 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the stated position of the AMA that "prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Choosing faith healing while rejecting [[modern medicine]] can and does cause people to die needlessly.&lt;ref name=Cogan1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Cogan|title=Critical Thinking: Step by Step|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA217|year=1998|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-1067-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the "open-but-cautious" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.&lt;ref name="grudem et al."&gt;{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Saucy |title= Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? |editor-last= Grudem |editor-first= Wayne |editor-link= Wayne Grudem |year= 1996 |isbn= 0310201551 |chapter= |page=}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Carson]] is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an "open-but-cautious" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/bio/dacarson.html |title= D.A. Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly "Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, "But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so."{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, "Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith."{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174–5}}

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that "the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113–4}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying "At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the "healers" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L. Park]]&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; and doctor and consumer advocate [[Stephen Barrett]]&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a [[Jack Coe]] revival service in [[Miami, Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130129191538/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 29, 2013 |title= Faith healer dies – Victim of bulbar polio |newspaper= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |location= Yavapai County, AZ |date= December 18, 1956 |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Faith-healer' dies of polio |date= December 17, 1956 |newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]] |location= Salina, KS |page= 5 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40757536/ |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt; However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Mike |title= Lost faith: Mother's story of healer |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19560208&amp;id=AJ0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MekFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3001,2779353 |date= February 8, 1956 |page= 7A |newspaper= [[The Miami News|The Miami Daily News]] |location= Miami, FL |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the efforts of [[Joseph L.

===Miracles for sale===
TV personality [[Derren Brown]] produced a show on faith healing entitled "Miracles for sale" which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.&lt;ref name="metro-derren-brown"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041421/http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303/ |dead-url= no |archive-date= February 15, 2013 |title= Derren Brown: Miracles For Sale was deceptively entertaining polio |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= April 25, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States law==
The 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse]] laws in order to receive federal money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Merrick |first=Janna C. |year= 2003 |title= Spiritual healing, sick kids and the law: Inequities in the American healthcare system |journal= [[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]] |volume= 29 |issue=2-3 |pages= 269–99 |pmid= 12961808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAPTA amendments of 1996 {{usc|42|5106i}} state:

"(1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; and "(2) to require that a State find, or to prohibit a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian.

"(b) State Requirement. – Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State shall, at a minimum, have in place authority under State law to permit the child protective services system of the State to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions. Except with respect to the withholding of medically indicated treatments from disabled infants with life threatening conditions, case by case determinations concerning the exercise of the authority of this subsection shall be within the sole discretion of the State.}}

Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=[[Child Welfare Information Gateway]], [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services]] |date=April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- updated version (February 2011) available at url given --&gt; In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4328">The '''First Earth Battalion''' was the name proposed by Lieutenant Colonel [[Jim Channon]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[soldier]] who had served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], for his [[idea]] of a new [[military]] of [[supersoldier]]s to be organized along [[New Age]] lines. A book of the same name was published in 1982.

==''The Men Who Stare at Goats''==
According to the book ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' by [[journalist]] [[Jon Ronson]], Channon spent time in the 1970s with many of the people in [[California]] credited with starting the [[Human Potential Movement]], and subsequently wrote an operations manual for a First Earth Battalion. The manual was a 125-page mixture of drawings, graphs, maps, polemical essays, and point-by-point redesigns of every aspect of military life. Channon imagined a new battlefield uniform that would include pouches for [[ginseng]] regulators, [[Dowsing|divining tools]], food stuffs to enhance [[night vision]], and a loudspeaker that would automatically emit "[[indigenous music]] and words of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, B. (2006). ''Immortal Combat: Portrait of a True Warrior.'' Berkeley, CA: Blue Snake Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson, J. (2004). ''The Men Who Stare at Goats.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|movie based on the book]]—released in Autumn 2009—starring [[George Clooney]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Kevin Spacey]], fictionalized the First Earth Battalion as the ''New Earth Army''.

==Beliefs==
Channon believed the [[Army]] could be the principal [[moral]] and [[ethical]] basis on which [[politics]] could harmonize in the name of the [[Earth]]. He declared that the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance was to the planet earth.&lt;ref&gt;Grant De Pauw, L. (2000). ''Battle Cries and Lullabies: Women in War from Prehistory to the Present.'' Oklahoma City, OK: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Channon envisioned that the First Earth Battalion would organize itself informally: uniforms without uniformity, structure without status, and unity powered by diversity, and members would be [[multicultural]], with each [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] contributing to "rainbow power".&lt;ref&gt;McRae, R.F. (1984). ''Mind Wars: The True Story of Government Research into the Military Potential of Psychic Weapons.'' New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed as a guiding principle that members of the First Earth Battalion seek nondestructive methods of [[conflict resolution]] because their first [[loyalty]] is to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, M. (1980). ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in Our Time.'' Los Angeles, CA: J.P. Tarcher, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warrior Monk===
Channon adopted the term "[[warrior monk]]" for potential members of the First Earth Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Druckman, D., &amp; Swets, J.A. (eds.). (1988). ''Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques.'' Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credo===
According to the book ''Mind Wars'' by Ronald McRae, each member of the First Earth Battalion would be sworn to uphold a credo of "high [[commandos]] and [[guerrilla]] [[gurus]]":
* I have the capacity and therefore the duty to contribute to the development of myself, my associates, and our planet, simultaneously, now!
* I will organize a self-supporting high commando group that will create and perform evolutionary breakthrough actions on behalf of people and planet. One people, one planet.
* I will then pass on this concept to others who are capable of generating further self-organizing commando teams.
* I will await the time when my group can connect naturally with others at higher and higher levels of awareness and performance — the Natural Guard.

This [[transmembrane]] [[glycoprotein]] complex is composed of four subunits: GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPV and GPIX. Each of them has a variable number of [[leucine]]-rich repeats. GPIbα and GPIbβ are linked by [[disulfide]] bridges, while the GPV and GPIX associate non-[[covalent]]ly with the complex. GPIbα subunit bears the binding site for [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF), α-thrombin, leukocyte integrin αMβ2 and P-selectin. The binding between GPIbα and vWF mediates the capture of platelets to the injured vascular wall. The deficiency in glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex synthesis leads to Bernard-Soulier syndrome.&lt;ref&gt; LEPAGE, A., M. LEBOEUF, J.P. CAZENAVE, C. SALLE, F. LANZA a G. UZAN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">'''Generalized [[likelihood]] [[uncertainty]] [[estimation]]''' ('''GLUE''') is a statistical method used in [[hydrology]] for quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions. The method was introduced by [[Keith Beven]] and Andrew Binley in 1992.&lt;ref name="BevenBinley1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beven|first1=Keith|last2=Binley|first2=Andrew|title=The future of distributed models: Model calibration and uncertainty prediction|journal=Hydrological Processes|volume=6|issue=3|year=1992|pages=279–298|issn=0885-6087|doi=10.1002/hyp.3360060305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BevenBinley2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beven|first1=Keith|last2=Binley|first2=Andrew|title=GLUE: 20 years on|journal=Hydrological Processes|volume=28|issue=24|year=2014|pages=5897–5918|issn=0885-6087|doi=10.1002/hyp.10082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of GLUE is that given our inability to represent exactly in a [[mathematical model]] how nature works, there will always be several different models that mimic equally well an observed natural process (such as [[discharge (hydrology)|river discharge]]). Such equally acceptable or [[behavioral]] models are therefore called [[equifinality|equifinal]].&lt;ref name="BevenFreer2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beven|first1=Keith|last2=Freer|first2=Jim|title=Equifinality, data assimilation, and uncertainty estimation in mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems using the GLUE methodology|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=249|issue=1-4|year=2001|pages=11–29|issn=0022-1694|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(01)00421-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology deals with models whose results are expressed as [[probability distribution]]s of possible outcomes, often in the form of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, and the problem can be viewed as assessing, and comparing between models, how good these representations of uncertainty are. There is an implicit understanding that the models being used are approximations to what might be obtained from a thorough [[Bayesian analysis]] of the problem if a fully adequate model of real-world hydrological processes were available.&lt;ref&gt;Beven, K.J., 2007: [http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/460/2007/hess-11-460-2007.pdf Towards integrated environmental models of everywhere: uncertainty, data and modelling as a learning process.] [[Hydrology and Earth System Sciences]], 11(1), p. 460–467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MantovanTodini2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantovan|first1=Pietro|last2=Todini|first2=Ezio|title=Hydrological forecasting uncertainty assessment: Incoherence of the GLUE methodology|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=330|issue=1-2|year=2006|pages=368–381|issn=0022-1694|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.04.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goodman fatigue equation''' is used by engineers for [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] analysis. The equation is used to make [[correlation]]s of experimental fatigue data of [[metals]] and other materials.

The equation is also used to determine the failure mechanisms of sucker rods in pumping [[oil well]]s worldwide, and to help design new sucker rod strings for rod-pumped oil wells.

== Sources ==
From similar triangles the Goodman fatigue equation is :

( 4a)         τm /Sus + τa /Ses   =   1/n       in which the stress components are given by 
                                      τm   =   Ks 8 FmC / πd2     where   Fm   =   ( Fhi + Flo ) /2     and 
                                      τa   =   Kh 8 Fa C / πd2    where   Fa   =   ( Fhi - Flo ) /2

'''''Historia Naturalis Brasiliae''''' ({{lang-en|Brazilian Natural History}}), originally written in Latin, is the first scientific work on the [[natural history]] of [[Brazil]], written by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] naturalist [[Willem Piso]] and research by German scientist [[Georg Marcgrave|Georg Marcgraf]], published in 1648.&lt;ref name="s4ulanguages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4ulanguages.com/marcgrave-montanus.html |title=Marcgrave Montanus - S4U Languages - Brazilian translation. Salvador and São Paulo. Ensino de idiomas and Brazilian Portuguese translations &amp;#124; Facsimile of original 1648 manuscript |publisher=s4ulanguages.com|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work includes observations made by the German naturalist H. Gralitzio, in addition to humanist [[John de Laet|Johannes de Laet]].&lt;ref&gt;Neil Safier, "Beyond Brazilian Nature: The Editorial Itineraries of Marcgraf and Piso's ''Historia Naturalis Brasiliae''," in Michiel Van Grosen, ''The Legacy of Dutch Brazil''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2014, pp. 168-186.&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Johan Maurits]], Count of Nassau, who was the patron of the project during the period of [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch rule in Brazil]].&lt;ref name=hnb&gt;''História Natural do Brasil'' - edição brasileira: {{cite book|author=Guilherme Piso (trans.

Though referring to Brazil generally throughout the text, the authors' research was of the coastal strip of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], occupied by the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It is based on Marcgraf and Piso's time in Brazil, starting in 1637. It  offers an important early European insight into Brazilian flora and fauna by analyzing plants and animals and studying tropical diseases and indigenous therapies.  Also included is William Piso's interpretation and first opinions of the indigenous people who he would go on to describe as barbarous and lacking in science.  This would lead to concern amongst Piso and his contemporaries that these people might not be able to contribute to studying medicine and botany.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Justin E.

The work consists of a single volume, originally measuring 40 [[centimeters]] (height) and its full title, with subtitle, is: "'' Historia naturalis Brasiliae ...: in qua non tantum plantae et animalia, sed et indigenarum morbi, ingenia et mores describuntur et iconibus supra quingentas illustrantur '' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/library.asp?relation=QH117P571648 |title=Bibliographic Information |language=|author=Rare books of Missouri Botanical Garden Library |date=|publisher=www.illustrategarden.org |accessdate=2010-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian physician and researcher Juliano Moreira said of the work: &lt;blockquote&gt; This clearly masterful work, when carefully reexamined, shows, at each perquisition, new excellences, and thus it is still one of the most authentic glories of Dutch medical literature. We owe to Pies a description, so accurate and meticulous, of the then reigning endemics in Brazil and the means of treating them. He observed the [[yaws]], [[tetanus]], various types of paralysis, [[dysentery]], [[hemeralopia]], [[maculopapular]]. He described [[Ipecac]] and [[emetic|emeto]] - cathartic qualities, which aboriginals used long before the famous doctor [[Adrian Helvetius]], grandfather of the notable French philosopher [[Claudio Adriano Helvetius]] received from [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] a thousand [[Louis (coin)|louis]] gold, titles and honors for having discovered exactly those same therapeutic virtues. The Treaty of Helvetius titled ''"Remède contre le cours du ventre''.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Afonso de E. Taunay, "Escorço biográfico", In: História Natural do Brasil, op. cit., pg. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work circulated widely in northern Europe and beyond, so that while it detailed the flora and fauna of coastal South America, it was an important publication for those working elsewhere. Richly illustrated scientific texts allowed knowledge to be disseminated even when scholars themselves could not travel to the research site.  The work remained unsurpassed until the nineteenth century, and between its initial publication and subsequent research it remained highly influential.  Diverse writers referred to the text, including [[Miguel Venegas]], author of ''Noticia de la California'' (1757), Anglo-American Protestant theologian [[Cotton Mather]], who saw in the text evidence of divine planning; and amateur American naturalist [[Thomas Jefferson]], who mentioned Marcgraf in his ''Notes on the State of Virginia''.&lt;ref&gt;Safier, "Beyond Brazilian Nature", p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work would prove to be incredibly influential especially in the field of ecology, being used by a variety of different ecologists in different locations and time. The long lasting influence could be seen outside of just the field of ecology, as well, with various other forms of science utilizing the findings in various ways. In particular, [[Ole Worm]] utilized a similar organizational structure when documenting natural history of [[Denmark]] while even using some of the images in his work, [[Museum Wormianum]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Da Silva, Maria Angélica, and Melissa Mota Alcides. “Collecting and Framing the Wilderness: The Garden of Johan Maurits (1604-79) in North-East Brazil.” Garden History, vol. 30, no. 2, 2002, pp. 153–176.

Relevancy was still found in the 20th century with a herbarium being discovered that would contain a hefty amount of items that were used in the Netherlands during the 17th century. The utility of these documents from [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]] were able to assist other researchers and academics even in a more modern context. This discovery would also cause people to seek out a variety of these books detailing herbariums in order to achieves further information that Maurice may have.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce MacBryde. “Rediscovery of G.

'''Homeopathy''' or '''homœopathy''' is a system of [[alternative medicine]] created in 1796 by [[Samuel Hahnemann]], based on his doctrine of ''like cures like'' (''[[similia similibus curentur]]''), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people.&lt;ref name="Hahnemann"/&gt; Homeopathy is a [[pseudoscience]] – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific.&lt;ref name=Tuomela/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baran2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladyman/&gt; Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a [[placebo]], indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are due to factors such as normal recovery from illness, or [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name=pmid12492603/&gt;&lt;ref name="shang"/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504/&gt;

Hahnemann believed the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed ''miasms'', and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using a process of [[homeopathic dilution]], in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being struck against an elastic material, commonly a [[Bookbinding|leather-bound]] book.&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128"/&gt; Dilution typically continues well past the point where no [[molecule]]s of the original substance remain.&lt;!-- THIS REF IS THE SAME AS ref name "dynam" --&gt;&lt;ref name="Dynamization and Dilution"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamization and dilution |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine |publisher=[[Creighton University]] Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826082134/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2002 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also: &lt;ref name=SmithHM /&gt;&lt;ref name="homsim" /&gt; --&gt; Homeopaths select homeopathics&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports" /&gt; by consulting reference books known as ''repertories'', and by considering the totality of the patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.&lt;ref name="Organon_5th_5+217"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann S]]|title =The Organon of the Healing Art |year =1833 |edition=5th |at=aphorisms 5 and 217 |isbn=978-0-87983-228-5|title-link =The Organon of the Healing Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context===
The concept of "like cures like" may have been suggested by [[Hippocrates]] around 400 BC, when he prescribed a small dose of [[mandrake root]] to treat mania, knowing it produces mania in much larger doses.&lt;ref name="Hemenway1894"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1894.02420900001001|title=Modern Homeopathy and Medical Science|year=1894|last1=Hemenway|first1=Henry Bixby|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|issue=11|pages=367|volume=XXII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 16th century, [[Paracelsus]] wrote "[[similia similibus curantur]]" (similar to the [[subjunctive]] form later used by Hahnemann), often translated as "what makes a man ill also cures him".&lt;ref name="Hemenway1894"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/442424/Paracelsus |title=Paracelsus (German-Swiss physician) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate =March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, mainstream medicine used methods like [[bloodletting]] and purging, and administered complex mixtures, such as [[Venice treacle]], which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German. Being sceptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s use for curing [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the "law of similars" that had been proposed by ancient physicians.&lt;ref name="UllmanReichenberg-Ullman1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert W. Ullman|author2=Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman|title=The patient's guide to homeopathic medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LColT6LtubcC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=October 1, 1994|publisher=Picnic Point Press|isbn=978-0-9640654-2-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the effects of eating cinchona bark noted by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and published in 1861, failed to reproduce the symptoms Hahnemann reported.&lt;ref name=Holmes /&gt;{{rp|128}} Hahnemann's law of similars is a [[postulate]] rather than a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite journal |title= A wail from the waste-basket |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dencos/acf8385.0036.001/1050:349?didno=ACF8385.0036.001;rgn=full+text;view=image |journal=[[The Dental Cosmos]] |type=editorial |editor=J.

Subsequent scientific work showed that cinchona cures malaria because it contains [[quinine]], which kills the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' parasite that causes the disease; the mechanism of action is unrelated to Hahnemann's ideas.&lt;ref name="Atwood-BTTF1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/homeopathy-and-evidence-based-medicine-back-to-the-future-part-i/ | title=Homeopathy and evidence-based medicine: back to the future | publisher=[[Science Based Medicine]] | date=January 4, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2013 | last=Atwood |first=Kimball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Provings"====
Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as "homeopathic proving". These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by clearly recording all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.&lt;ref name="Haehl1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=January 24, 2013|year=1922|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-693-3|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a collection of provings in 1805, and a second collection of 65 preparations appeared in his book, ''[[Homeopathic Materia Medica|Materia Medica Pura]]'', in 1810.&lt;ref name="Kirschmann2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Taylor Kirschmann|title=A vital force: women in American homeopathy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSoIGDKsVosC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=January 28, 2013|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3320-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Dynamization and Dilution" /&gt; Hahnemann believed that this process aroused and enhanced "the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances".&lt;ref name="Organon_5th_269"&gt;

In the ''Organon'', Hahnemann introduced the concept of "miasms" as "infectious principles" underlying chronic disease.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2001"&gt;{{cite book |author= John Henry Clarke |title= Homeopathy explained |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUGIWuo4qc8C&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher= Nanopathy |pages=22–|id= GGKEY:JWCD56EF80T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, and thought that initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases. If, however, these symptoms were suppressed by medication, the cause went deeper and began to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.&lt;ref name="miasms"/&gt; Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly [[Symptomatic treatment|alleviating their symptoms]], as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all "disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency".&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann's [[hypotheses]] for the direct or remote cause of all chronic diseases (miasms) originally presented only three, psora (the itch), syphilis (venereal disease) or sycosis (fig-wart disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Homoeopathy|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three the most important was ''psora'' (Greek for "itch"), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name="Hahnemann_Chronic"&gt;

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=JW |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it really works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148–9|date=November 2012}}

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===
Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Miller | title = America's alternative religions | publisher = State University of New York Press, Albany | date = 1995 | pages = 80 | isbn = 978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the [[American Institute of Homeopathy]], was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States,&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;

During 19th-century epidemics of diseases such as [[cholera]], death rates in homeopathic hospitals were often lower than in conventional hospitals, where the treatments used at the time were often harmful and did little or nothing to combat the diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Death rates in conventional hospitals were typically two- to eight-fold higher than in homeopathic hospitals for patients with these infectious diseases; see

From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science. [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]], physician to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], said in 1843 that the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, "an outrage to human reason".&lt;ref name=John_Forbes&gt;

According to [[:de:Paul Ulrich Unschuld|Paul Ulrich Unschuld]], the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany was fascinated by homeopathy, and spent large sums of money on researching its mechanisms, but without gaining a positive result. Unschuld further argues that homeopathy never subsequently took root in the [[United States]], but remained more deeply established in European thinking.&lt;ref name="Unschuld2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ulrich Unschuld|title=What Is Medicine?: Western and Eastern Approaches to Healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPMTlS1pzEUC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=September 7, 2013|date=August 9, 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94470-1|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathy uses animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its preparations, generally referring to them using [[Latin]] or faux-Latin names. Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]).

Some homeopaths use so-called "'''nosodes'''" (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"/&gt; Conversely, preparations made from "healthy" specimens are called "sarcodes".

Some modern homeopaths use preparations they call "imponderables" because they do not originate from a substance but some other phenomenon presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or [[lactose]].&lt;!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--&gt; Examples include [[X-ray]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Other minority practices include paper preparations, where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, and the use of [[radionics]] to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Preparation===
[[File:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|[[Mortar and pestle]] used for grinding insoluble solids, such as [[platinum]], into homeopathic preparations]]

Hahnemann found that undiluted doses caused reactions, sometimes dangerous ones, so specified that preparations be given at the lowest possible dose. He found that this reduced potency as well as side-effects, but formed the view that vigorous shaking and striking on an elastic surface – a process he termed ''Schütteln'', translated as ''succussion'' – nullified this.&lt;ref&gt;

Serial dilution is achieved by taking an amount of the mixture and adding solvent, but the "Korsakovian" method may also be used, whereby the vessel in which the preparations are manufactured is emptied, refilled with solvent, and the volume of fluid adhering to the walls of the vessel is deemed sufficient for the new batch.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|270|date=January 2015}} The Korsakovian method is sometimes referred to as K on the label of a homeopathic preparation, e.g. 200CK is a 200C preparation made using the Korsakovian method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathy: Diluted out of existence?|url=http://www.scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas/homeopathy-diluted-out-of-existence/|publisher=scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine Potency or Dilution |url=http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |publisher=ritecare.com |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821064849/http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxion and radionics methods of preparation do not require succussion.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|171|date=January 2015}} There are differences of opinion on the number and force of strikes, and some practitioners dispute the need for succussion at all while others reject the Korsakovian and other non-classical preparations.

===Dilutions===
{{Main|Homeopathic dilutions}}

Three main [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the "centesimal" or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favoured by Hahnemann for most of his life.

A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100.

This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern.

In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher "potency", and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128"&gt;

In Hahnemann's time, it was reasonable to assume the preparations could be diluted indefinitely, as the concept of the atom or molecule as the smallest possible unit of a chemical substance was just beginning to be recognized.

The greatest dilution reasonably likely to contain even one molecule of the original substance is 12C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page 3|title=Alternative Medicine: Homeopathy-A Review|url=http://www.ijopjournal.com/File_Folder/57-69.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Pharmacotherapy|accessdate=August 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903231608/http://www.ijopjournal.com/File_Folder/57-69.pdf|archive-date=September 3, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a "pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans",&lt;ref name=Bambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; which is approximately correct.&lt;ref&gt;
A 12C solution produced using [[sodium chloride]] (also called ''natrum muriaticum'' in homeopathy) is the equivalent of dissolving 0.36&amp;nbsp;mL of table salt, weighing about 0.77&amp;nbsp;g, into a volume of water the size of the Atlantic Ocean, since the volume of the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas is 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;L :

The high dilutions characteristically used are often considered to be the most controversial and implausible aspect of homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=P |title=The Memory of Water: a scientific heresy? |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=141–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17678808 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all homeopaths advocate high dilutions.

The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines.
Those favouring low dilutions stressed [[pathology]] and a stronger link to conventional medicine, while those favouring high dilutions emphasized vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.&lt;ref&gt;

===Provings===
A homeopathic "proving" is the method by which the profile of a homeopathic preparation is determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dantas |first1=F |last2=Fisher |first2=P |last3=Walach |first3=H |last4=Wieland |first4=F |last5=Rastogi |first5=D |last6=Teixeira |first6=H |last7=Koster |first7=D |last8=Jansen |first8=J |last9=Eizayaga |first9=J |title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic pathogenetic trials published from 1945 to 1995 |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=4–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17227742 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with preparations at a 30C dilution,&lt;ref name = "Organon_6th_128"/&gt; and most modern provings are carried out using ultra-dilute preparations in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the proving process, Hahnemann administered preparations to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a "drug picture".

The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Thomas Lindsley|title=The Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann|date=1895|publisher=Boericke &amp; Tafel|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1330001509|pages=103–04|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofdrs00brad|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings are claimed to have been important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. &lt;!--Examination of psychological state may include an inquiry into the content of dreams.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;"Modern Homeopathy And Medical Science"''''', Journal of the American Medical Association, vol 22, March 17, '''1894''', pp. 367–77, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+definition+ama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bITPMPPwr9&amp;sig=56_xALWwOFWYa4P4BQKj0mjw-eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z7k6TeO1CpC-sQPK2I26Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=similars&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; outdated source, statement can be reintroduced when a better source is found --&gt;The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;

From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient using ''materia medica'' and repertories. In classical homeopathy, the practitioner attempts to match a single preparation to the totality of symptoms (the ''simlilum''), while "clinical homeopathy" involves combinations of preparations based on the various symptoms of an illness.&lt;ref name=pmid12614092/&gt;

===Pills and active ingredients===
[[File:DoseOscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Homeopathic pills, homeopathic preparation ''[[oscillococcinum]]'']]

The process of homeopathic dilution results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. [[Calendula officinalis|calendula]] and arnica creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses.

====Isopathy====
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy, invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the preparations, known as "nosodes", are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]] or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]].&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Flower preparations====
Flower preparations can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the physician and homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. Although the proponents of these preparations share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the preparations are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force" as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower preparations are manufactured in allegedly "gentler" ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the preparations are not succussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic Journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–27 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower preparations being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title="Flower remedies": a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Veterinary use====
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals termed "veterinary homeopathy", dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.&lt;ref name=Saxton2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy may belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may be treated only by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy.

The UK's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra) has adopted a robust position against use of "alternative" pet preparations including homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/alternative-pet-remedies-government-clampdown Alternative pet remedies: Government clampdown]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrohomeopathy====
{{main|Electrohomeopathy}}
Popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18340908|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=4|issue=1|pages=86–100|pmc=1692573|journal=Medical Library and Historical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrohomeopathy is somewhat associated with an Spagyric medicine in that the disease is usually multi-organic in cause or effect and calls for holistic treatment that is both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The Allahabad High Court in Kanpur handed down a decree in 2012 which stated that electrohomeopathy was an unrecognized system of medicine which was quackery.&lt;ref name="toie"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Holi-Electro-homeopathy-clinics-to-be-sealed-after-the-festival/articleshow/12140070.cms |title=Electro-homeopathy clinics to be sealed after Holi |date=5 March 2012 |work=Times of India |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and efficacy ==

The low concentration of homeopathic preparations, which often lack even a single [[molecule]] of the diluted substance,&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"/&gt; has been the basis of questions about the effects of the preparations since the 19th century. Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of "[[water memory]]", according to which water "remembers" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise.&lt;ref name=NatureWhenToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maddox J|title=When to believe the unbelievable |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6176 |pages=1349–56 |year=1988 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |doi=10.1038/333787a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333Q.787. |type=editorial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delusion"/&gt; [[Pharmacological]] research has found instead that stronger effects of an active ingredient come from [[dose-response relationship|higher]], not lower doses.

[[James Randi]] and the [[10:23 campaign]] groups have highlighted the lack of [[active ingredient]]s in most homeopathic products by taking large 'overdoses'.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; None of the hundreds of demonstrators in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US were injured and "no one was cured of anything, either".&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Sam Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/29/sceptics-homeopathy-mass-overdose-boots "Homeopathy protesters to take 'mass overdose' outside Boots"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coghlan&gt;{{cite web |author=Coghlan A|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18455-mass-drug-overdose--none-dead.html |title=Mass drug overdose – none dead |date=February 1, 2010|publisher= New Scientist |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopaths contend that their methods produce a therapeutically active preparation, selectively including only the intended substance, though critics note that any water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, and homeopaths have not been able to account for a reason why only the selected homeopathic substance would be a special case in their process.&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt; For comparison, ISO 3696:1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation.

Physicist [[Robert L. Park]], former executive director of the [[American Physical Society]], is quoted as saying:

&lt;!--- Please do not change the following direct quote, even if you think it would be an improvement.

BEGIN DIRECT QUOTE --&gt;"since the least amount of a substance in a solution is one molecule, a 30C solution would have to have at least one molecule of the original substance dissolved in a minimum of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,&lt;wbr&gt;000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [or 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;] molecules of water.

&lt;!-- A similarly worded statement in page 56 of Park RL, "Voodoo science: the road from foolishness to fraud". Oxford University Press, 2002. ISBN 0-19-860443-2 --&gt;

Park is also quoted as saying that, "to expect to get even one molecule of the 'medicinal' substance allegedly present in 30X pills, it would be necessary to take some two billion of them, which would total about a thousand tons of lactose plus whatever impurities the lactose contained".&lt;ref name=Sbarrett/&gt;

The Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations in 2015, in which it concluded that "there were no health conditions for which there was reliable evidence that homeopathy was effective. No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than placebo, or caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment."&lt;ref name=NHMRC&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[National Health and Medical Research Council]] |title=NHMRC statement on homeopathy and NHMRC information paper – Evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions |date=2015 |quote=There is no reliable evidence that homoeopathy is effective for treating health conditions. |location=Canberra |publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council |page=16 |isbn=978-1-925129-29-8 |url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/cam02 |access-date=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419065845/https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/cam02 |archive-date=April 19, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2017, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) published its official analysis and conclusion on the use of homeopathic products, finding a lack of evidence that homeopathic products are effective, and raising concerns about quality control.&lt;ref name=EASAC2017/&gt;

====Publication bias and other methodological problems====
{{Further|Statistical hypothesis testing|P-value|Publication bias}}
The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a [[statistical significance|"statistically significant"]] positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%―a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name="Sterne2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sterne |first1=JAC |last2=Davey Smith |first2=G |title=Sifting the evidence---what's wrong with significance tests?

In a systematic review of the methodological quality of randomized trials in three branches of alternative medicine, Linde ''et al.'' highlighted major weaknesses in the homeopathy sector, including poor randomization.&lt;ref name="pmid11416076"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K|authorlink1=Klaus Linde |last2=Jonas |first2=WB |last3=Melchart |first3=D |last4=Willich |first4=S |title=The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials of homeopathy, herbal medicines and acupuncture |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=526–31 |year=2001 |pmid=11416076 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.3.526}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate 2001 systematic review that assessed the quality of clinical trials of homeopathy found that such trials were generally of lower quality than trials of conventional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Anderson|first2=RL|last3=Crawford|first3=CC|last4=Lyons|first4=JS|title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic clinical trials|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2001|volume=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-1-12|pmid=11801202|pmc=64638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related issue is [[publication bias]]: researchers are more likely to submit trials that report a positive finding for publication, and journals prefer to publish positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=David L. |title=Bias in analytic research |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=32 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–63 |year=1979 |pmid=447779 |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(79)90012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pp"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Robert |title=The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=86 |pages=638–41 |year=1979 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey D.

Both [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other [[systematic review]]s of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref name="PRISMA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberati | first1 = A | last2 = Altman | first2 = DG | last3 = Tetzlaff | first3 = J | last4 = Mulrow | first4 = C | last5 = Gøtzsche | first5 = PC | last6 = Ioannidis | first6 = J PA | last7 = Clarke | first7 = M | last8 = Devereaux | first8 = PJ | last9 = Kleijnen | first9 = J | last10 = Moher | first10 = D | title = The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000100 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19621070 | pmc = 2707010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in comparison with placebo more often tended to generate positive results, but appeared unconvincing overall.&lt;ref name="LindeBMC-ComplementAlternMed2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linde | first1 = K | last2 = Hondras | first2 = M | last3 = Vickers | first3 = A | last4 = Ter Riet | first4 = G | last5 = Melchart | first5 = D | title = Systematic reviews of complementary therapies – an annotated bibliography.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most "original" subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.&lt;ref name=Linde1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K |last2=Scholz |first2=M |last3=Ramirez |first3=G |last4=Clausius |first4=N |last5=Melchart |first5=D |last6=Jonas |first6=WB |title=Impact of study quality on outcome in placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=631–36 |year=1999 |pmid=10391656 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent work by [[John Ioannidis]] and others has shown that for treatments with no prior plausibility, the chances of a positive result being a false positive are much higher, and that any result not consistent with the [[null hypothesis]] should be assumed to be a false positive.&lt;ref name="pmid16060722" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21552759 | volume=45 | issue=3 | title=The role of plausibility in the evaluation of scientific research | author=Almeida RM | journal=Rev Saude Publica | pages=617–20| year=2011 | doi=10.1590/s0034-89102011000300021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed in 2002 that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic preparation exerts clinical effects different from placebo.&lt;ref name="pmid12492603" /&gt;

In 2005, ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine|Programme for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were "compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects".&lt;ref name="shang" /&gt; This was accompanied by an editorial pronouncing "The end of homoeopathy",&lt;ref name=EndofHomeopathy&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |title=The end of homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |page=690 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67149-8 |pmid=16125567 |issue=9487}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was denounced by the homeopath [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]].&lt;ref name="Fisher-Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Homeopathy and The Lancet | last=Fisher |first=P | journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med | date=March 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=145–47 | doi=10.1093/ecam/nek007 | pmc=1375230 | pmid=16550237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the most reliable evidence did not support the effectiveness of non-individualized homeopathy. The authors noted that "the quality of the body of evidence is low."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathie |first=Robert T. |last2=Ramparsad |first2=Nitish |last3=Legg |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Clausen |first4=Jürgen |last5=Moss |first5=Sian |last6=Davidson |first6=Jonathan R.

The results of these reviews are generally negative or only weakly positive, and reviewers consistently report the poor quality of trials. The finding of Linde ''et. al.'' that more rigorous studies produce less positive results is supported in several and contradicted by none.

Some clinical trials have tested individualized homeopathy, and there have been reviews of this, specifically. A 1998 review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=Klaus |last2=Melchart |first2=Dieter |title=Randomized Controlled Trials of Individualized Homeopathy: A State-of-the-Art Review |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=371–88 |year=1998 |pmid=9884175 |doi=10.1089/acm.1998.4.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled [[odds ratio]] of 1.17 to 2.23 in favour of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded that "the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies." Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|209|date=November 2012}} A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that individualized homeopathic remedies may be slightly more effective than placebos, though the authors noted that their findings were based on low- or unclear-quality evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathie |first=Robert T. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Suzanne M. |last3=Legg |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Clausen |first4=Jürgen |last5=Moss |first5=Sian |last6=Davidson |first6=Jonathan R.

===Explanations of perceived effects===
Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the preparations themselves are inert:&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|155–167|date=November 2012}}
* The [[placebo effect]] – the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect.
* Therapeutic effect of the consultation – the care, concern, and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being.&lt;ref name="BrienRheumatology"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.abstract | title=Homeopathy has clinical benefits in rheumatoid arthritis patients that are attributable to the consultation process but not the homeopathic remedy: a randomized controlled clinical trial |author1=Brien S |author2=Lachance S |author3=Prescott P |author4=McDermott C |author5=Lewith G | journal=Rheumatology | date=June 2011 | volume=50 | issue=6 | pages=1070–82 | doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keq234 | pmid=21076131 | pmc=3093927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unassisted [[healing|natural healing]] – time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord.
* Unrecognized treatments – an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent, or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred.
* [[Regression toward the mean|Regression towards the mean]] – since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they may feel better anyway but because of the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken.
* Non-homeopathic treatment – patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement.
* Cessation of unpleasant treatment – often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient.

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American [[Scientific misconduct|scientific fraud]] investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."&lt;ref name="delusion"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benveniste defended his results by comparing the inquiry to the Salem witch hunts and asserting that "It may be that all of us are wrong in good faith. This is no crime but science as usual and only the future knows."&lt;/ref&gt; James Randi stated that he doubted that there had been any conscious fraud, but that the researchers had allowed "wishful thinking" to influence their interpretation of the data.&lt;ref name="wsullivan" /&gt;

In 2001 and 2004, [[Madeleine Ennis]] published a number of studies that reported that homeopathic dilutions of histamine exerted an effect on the activity of basophils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=V|last2=Ennis|first2=M|title=Flow-cytometric analysis of basophil activation: inhibition by histamine at conventional and homeopathic concentrations|journal=Inflammation Research |date=April 2001|volume=50 Suppl 2|pages=S47–48|pmid=11411598|doi=10.1007/PL00022402|doi-broken-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cumps|first1=J.|last2=Ennis|first2=M.|last3=Mannaioni|first3=P.

: "My plea is simply for honesty. Let people buy what they want, but tell them the truth about what they are buying. These treatments are biologically implausible and the clinical tests have shown they don't do anything at all in human beings. The argument that this information is not relevant or important for customers is quite simply ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Advertising Standards Authority]] concluded that the [[Society of Homeopaths]] were targeting vulnerable ill people and discouraging the use of essential medical treatment while making misleading claims of efficacy for homeopathic products.&lt;ref name=ASA&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA adjudication on Society of Homeopaths|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/7/Society-of-Homeopaths/SHP_ADJ_157043.aspx|publisher=ASA|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706020223/http://asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/7/Society-of-Homeopaths/SHP_ADJ_157043.aspx|archive-date=July 6, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adverse effects====
Some homeopathic preparations involve poisons such as Belladonna, arsenic, and poison ivy, which are highly diluted in the homeopathic preparation. In rare cases, the original ingredients are present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name=sr2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Government shares our interpretation of the evidence.&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504&gt;{{cite web |date=February 22, 2010 |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy – Science and Technology Committee |publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/4504.htm |accessdate=April 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with an informed patient choice – which the Government claims is very important – as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;}}

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] of the United States' [[National Institutes of Health]] states:

{{quote|Homeopathy is a controversial topic in complementary medicine research. A number of the key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics. For example, it is not possible to explain in scientific terms how a preparation containing little or no active ingredient can have any effect. This, in turn, creates major challenges to the rigorous clinical investigation of homeopathic preparations. For example, one cannot confirm that an extremely dilute preparation contains what is listed on the label, or develop objective measures that show effects of extremely dilute preparations in the human body.&lt;ref name="nih-homeo"&gt;{{cite web

[[Ben Goldacre]] noted that in the early days of homeopathy, when medicine was [[Heroic medicine|dogmatic]] and frequently worse than doing nothing, homeopathy at least failed to make matters worse:

{{quote|During the 19th-century cholera epidemic, death rates at the London Homeopathic Hospital were three times lower than at the Middlesex Hospital. Homeopathic sugar pills won't do anything against cholera, of course, but the reason for homeopathy's success in this epidemic is even more interesting than the placebo effect: at the time, nobody could treat cholera. So, while hideous medical treatments such as [[blood-letting]] were actively harmful, the homeopaths' treatments at least did nothing either way.&lt;ref name="Goldacre: A kind of magic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben |title=A kind of magic? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticized statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]], saying that "The unfortunate layman might well be misled by Vithoulkas' rhetoric into refusing orthodox treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The science of homoeopathy, by G.

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

==Regulation and prevalence==
{{Main|Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
[[File:Bristol Homeopathic.jpg|thumb|Hampton House, the former site of [[Bristol Homeopathic Hospital]].]]

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, Scotland, [[Luxembourg]] and England (though the latter will cease in February 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NHS Homeopathic care to end in 2019 |url=http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/service/medical-homeopathy-bristol/ |website=Portland Centre for Integrative Medicine |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, such as Belgium, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable,&lt;ref&gt;

Mock "overdosing" on homeopathic preparations by individuals or groups in "mass suicides" have become more popular since [[James Randi]] began taking entire bottles of homeopathic sleeping pills before giving lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Randi's fiery takedown of psychic fraud |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi.html|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=James Randi speaks homeopathy week 2010 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WyzM_TsIXc|publisher=[[JREF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=James Randi Lecture @ Caltech - Homeopathy |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jqP_1beVXQ|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|title=James Randi's challenge to homeopathy manufacturers and retail pharmacies |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMukj31qw1U|publisher=[[JREF]]|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 The [[Merseyside Skeptics Society]] from the United Kingdom launched the [[10:23 campaign]], encouraging groups to publicly overdose as groups.

In 2011, the non-profit, educational organizations [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) and the associated [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) have petitioned the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to initiate "rulemaking that would require all over-the-counter homeopathic drugs to meet the same standards of effectiveness as non-homeopathic drugs" and "to place warning labels on homeopathic drugs until such time as they are shown to be effective". In a separate petition, CFI and CSI request FDA to issue warning letters to [[Boiron]], maker of [[Oscillococcinum]], regarding their marketing tactic and criticize Boiron for misleading labelling and advertising of Oscillococcinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_and_csi_petition_fda_to_take_action_on_homeopathic_drugs/ |title=CFI and CSI petition FDA to take action on homeopathic drugs |publisher=Center for Inquiry|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, CFI filed comments urging the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to end the false advertising practice of homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_dawkins_ftc/|title=CFI and Dawkins Foundation Urge FTC to Stop Homeopathy's Falso Advertising|author=Press Release|publisher=CFI|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2016, FTC declared that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without "competent and reliable scientific evidence". If no such evidence exists, they must state this fact clearly on their labeling, and state that the product's claims are based only on 18th-century theories that have been discarded by modern science. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the [[FTC Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|title=FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs: Efficacy and Safety Claims Are Held to Same Standard as Other OTC Drug Claims|author=Press Release|publisher=FTC|date=November 15, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[CBC News]] reporter [[Erica Johnson]] for ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' conducted an investigation on the homeopathy industry in Canada; her findings were that it is "based on flawed science and some loopy thinking". [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) Vancouver skeptics participated in a mass overdose outside an emergency room in Vancouver, B.C., taking entire bottles of "medications" that should have made them sleepy, nauseous or dead; after 45 minutes of observation no ill effects were felt. Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims. All reported positive results but none could offer any science backing up their statements, only that "it works". Johnson was unable to find any evidence that homeopathic preparations contain any active ingredient. Analysis performed at the [[University of Toronto]]'s chemistry department found that the active ingredient is so small "it is equivalent to 5 billion times less than the amount of aspirin ... in a single pellet". Belladonna and ipecac "would be indistinguishable from each other in a [[blind test]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johnson, Erica|title= Homeopathy: Cure or Con?

==United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2015 hearing==
On April 20–21, 2015, the FDA held a hearing on homeopathic product regulation. Invitees representing the scientific and medical community, and various pro-homeopathy stakeholders, gave testimonials on homeopathic products and the regulatory role played by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=CFI testimony urges FDA to regulate homeopathic products|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=39|issue=4|pages=6–7|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael de Dora, a representative from the [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI), on behalf of the organization and dozens of doctors and scientists associated with CFI and the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) gave a testimonial which summarized the basis of the organization's objection to homeopathic products, the harm that is done to the general public and proposed regulatory actions:&lt;ref name=fdahearing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM443495.pdf|title=Homeopathic product regulation: evaluating the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory framework after a quarter-century. Testimony of the Center for Inquiry to the Food and Drug Administration|author=De Dora, Michael|publisher=FDA|date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI testimonial stated that the principle of homeopathy is at complete odds with the basic principles of modern biology, chemistry and physics and that decades of scientific examination of homeopathic products shows that there is no evidence that it is effective in treating illnesses other than acting as a placebo. Further, it noted a 2012 report by the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] which listed 10,311 reported cases of poison exposure related to homeopathic agents, among which 8,788 cases were attributed to young children five years of age or younger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=1|last1=Mowry|first1=J|last2=Spyker|first2=D|title=2012 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 30th Annual Report|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=51|issue=10|pages=949–1229|year=2013|url= https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2012_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf|doi=10.3109/15563650.2013.863906|pmid=24359283}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as examples of harm – including deaths – caused to patients who relied on homeopathics instead of proven medical treatment.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html|title=What's the harm in homeopathy|publisher=whatstheharm.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI urged the FDA to announce and implement strict guidelines that "require all homeopathic products meet the same standards as non-homeopathic drugs", arguing that the consumers can only have true [[Freedom of choice#In economics|freedom of choice]] (an often used argument from the homeopathy proponents) if they are fully informed of the choices. CFI proposed that the FDA take these three steps:
# ''Testing for homeopathic products'' The FDA will mandate that all homeopathic products on the market to perform and pass safety and efficacy tests equivalent to those required of non-homeopathic drugs.
# ''Labelling for homeopathic products'' To avert misleading label that the product is regulated by the FDA, all homeopathic products will be required to have prominent labels stating: (1) the product's claimed active ingredients in plain English, and (2) that the product has not been evaluated by the FDA for either safety or effectiveness.
# ''Regular consumer warnings'' Encouraged by the FDA's recent warning of the ineffectiveness of homeopathic products, CFI urged the FDA to issue regular warning to the consumers in addition to warning during public health crises and outbreaks.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;

In December 2017, the FDA announced it would strengthen regulation of homeopathic products focusing on "situations where homeopathic treatments are being marketed for serious diseases or conditions but have not been shown to offer clinical benefits" and where "products labeled as homeopathic contain potentially harmful ingredients or do not meet current good manufacturing practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=FDA to Regulate Some Homeopathic Products; CFI Hails Move|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official conclusions and recommendations ==

In March 2015, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] of Australia issued the following conclusions and recommendations:&lt;ref name=NHMRC/&gt;
* There is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective for treating health conditions.
* Homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious.
* People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.
* People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner. Those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments.

In November 2016, The United States FTC issued an "Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs" which specified that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims.&lt;ref name=FTC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: Enforcement Policy Statement on Marketing Claims for OTC Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/996984/p114505_otc_homeopathic_drug_enforcement_policy_statement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 15, 2016, FTC press release summarized the policy as follows:

:"The policy statement explains that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims. That is, companies must have competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims, including claims that a product can treat specific conditions. The statement describes the type of scientific evidence that the Commission requires of companies making such claims for their products... For the vast majority of OTC homeopathic drugs, the policy statement notes, 'the case for efficacy is based solely on traditional homeopathic theories and there are no valid studies using current scientific methods showing the product's efficacy.' As such, the marketing claims for these products are likely misleading, in violation of the FTC Act."&lt;ref name=2016PR&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the 2016 FTC Enforcement Policy Statement, the FTC also released its "Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report", which summarizes the panel presentations and related public comments in addition to describing consumer research commissioned by the FTC. The report concluded:
:"Efficacy claims for traditional OTC homeopathic products are only supported by homeopathic theories and homeopathic provings, which are not accepted by most modern medical experts and do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that these products have the claimed treatment effects."&lt;ref name="WSReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-homeopathic-medicine-advertising-workshop/p114505_otc_homeopathic_medicine_and_advertising_workshop_report.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hybrid shipping container''' is a shipping system that uses the energy of [[phase-change material]] (PCM) in combination with the ability to recharge without removing the media. This ability is known as "[[cold-energy battery]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencooling.co.uk/our-products/cold-batteries/ |title=Cold Batteries |publisher=Green Cooling |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, this technology is only being used in a limited number of shipping containers.

1. SkyCell 770C
2. SkyCell 1500C
3. SkyCell 770CRT
4. SkyCell 1500CRT

A Cold-energy battery works by storing energy to a given temperature and using its thermal mass to maintain this temperature. It can be recharged by being placed in a temperature range applicable to its phase change window.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inherence''' refers to [[Empedocles|Empedocles']] idea that the [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] of [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] come from the relative [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] of each of the [[Classical element|four elements]] entering into a thing.  The idea was further developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].

==Overview==
That Plato accepted (or at least did not reject) Empedocles' claim can be seen in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.  However, Plato also applied it to cover the presence of [[Theory of forms|form]] in matter.  The form is an active principle.  Matter, on the other hand is passive, being a mere [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] that the forms bring to life.

Aristotle clearly accepted Empedocles' claim,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061216164725/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/corruption/ ''On the Generation and Corruption''].&lt;/ref&gt; but he rejected Plato's idea of the forms.  According to Aristotle, the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]] of a [[Substance theory|substance]] are [[incorporeal]] [[beings]] which are present in it.&lt;ref&gt;"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject." (Aristotle, ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 1a24–26).&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is [[Participation (philosophy)|participation]].  If an attribute ''inheres'' in a subject, then the subject is said to ''participate'' in the attribute.  For example, if the attribute ''in Athens'' inheres in Socrates, then Socrates is said to participate in the attribute, ''in Athens.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">'''Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT)''' is an unproven [[alternative cancer treatment]] using [[insulin]] as an [[Adjunctive therapy|adjunct]] to [[low-dose chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid35260992"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ayre SG, Perez Garcia y Bellon D, Perez Garcia D|title = Insulin potentiation therapy: a new concept in the management of chronic degenerative disease|journal = Med. Hypotheses|volume = 20|issue = 2|pages = 199–210|year = 1986|pmid = 3526099|doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(86)90126-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quackwatch]], "Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is one of several unproven, dangerous treatments that is promoted by a small group of practitioners without trustworthy evidence that it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/ipt.html |title = Why You Should Stay Away from Insulin Potentiation |last1=Baratz |first1=Robert |date=10 March 2007 |publisher=Quackwatch |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was developed by Donato Perez Garcia, MD in 1930.  Originally, Garcia targeted [[syphilis]], and later tried the treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Insulin potentiation therapy|url = http://www.cam-cancer.org/CAM-Summaries/Dietary-approaches/Insulin-potentiation-therapy/%28merge%29|website = CAM-Cancer|accessdate = 2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Generally, a dose of insulin is injected into a vein, followed by a low dose of chemotherapy drugs when the insulin has been absorbed.  The chemotherapy dose is usually 10% to 25% of the proven dose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then sugar water is injected to stop the [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) caused by the insulin injection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Efficacy ==
IPT has not been proven to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What cancer care providers need to know about CAM: the CAM-Cancer project|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/fct.12017|journal = Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|access-date = 2015-04-29|last = Wider|first = Barbara|date = 17 May 2013|publisher = Wiley|pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long-term outcomes, such as survival, have never been published.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Four individual [[case studies]], one small, uncontrolled clinical trial and one small prospective, [[randomized controlled trial]] have shown temporary reductions in the size of tumors for some patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
The immediate risk is [[hypoglycemia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of lower than normal doses of chemotherapy can cause [[drug resistance]], which could make future treatment at standard, proven doses ineffective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For some cancers, especially breast and colon cancers, insulin may promote tumor growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Two main ideas about how it might work have been proposed.  The first idea is that insulin makes cells more permeable, so that the chemotherapy drugs are absorbed faster into cells.  The other idea is that insulin might cause the cells to start dividing, which makes them more susceptible to destruction of many [[Cytotoxic drug|cytotoxic]] chemotherapy drugs.

==Cost==
Costs run up to US $2,000 per treatment session.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Multiple sessions are normal.  Patients often pay the full cost out of pocket, because it is an unproven therapy that is not covered by health insurance.

A '''Kozyrev mirror''', in Russian [[esoteric]] literature from 1990s, is a device made from [[aluminum]] (sometimes from glass, or reflecting mirror-like material) spiral shape surfaces, which, according to a non-proved [[hypothesis]], are able to focus different types of [[radiation]]  including that coming from biological objects.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They are named after the famous astronomer [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev]], though they were neither invented nor described by him.

Kozyrev mirrors were used in experiments related to [[extrasensory perception|extrasensory perception (ESP)]], conducted in the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Siberia, division of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Humans, allocated into the cylindrical spirals  (usually 1.5 rotations clockwise, made of polished aluminum) allegedly experienced anomalous psycho-physical sensations, which had been recorded in the minutes of the research experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия чудес, загадок и тайн (Encyclopaedia of miracles, riddles and mysteries)|url=http://biblioteka.org.ua/book.php?id=1121023160&amp;p=30|year=2006|publisher=|location=Moskva|isbn=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kozyrev mirrors were shown in a documentary on the Russian state TV channel&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJ3FvUBX4E&lt;/ref&gt; and articles about them were published in tabloid newspapers in Russia and Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;http://novaya.com.ua/?/articles/2008/06/11/153126-11&lt;/ref&gt; but not in scientific journals.

There is a claim that during one of early experiments in the arctic village of Dixon, scientists placed an ancient symbol of Trinity into a mirror installation. Almost immediately there formed a field of force around the setup. The experiment was led by Vlail Kaznacheev MD, PhD, Academic Member of the Russian Academy of Medical Science {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

A 1998 Russian [[patent]], RU2122446, "Device for the correction of man's psychosomatic diseases", relates to Kozyrev mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RU212244: Device for correction of man's psychosomatic diseases|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19490059/RU2122446-KOZYREV-MIRROR-PATENT-DEVICE-FOR-CORRECTION-OF-MAN-S-PSYCHOSOMATIC-DISEASES|website=Scribd|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a Czech Republic group attempted, but failed, to [[crowdfunding|crowdfund]] 17,000-20,000 Euros for development of Kozyrev mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kozyrev Mirror Project.

[[File:Leiden Bio Science Park.JPG|thumb|Leiden Bio Science Park]]

The '''Leiden Bio Science park''' (LBSP) ranks in the top five of the most successful [[Business park|science parks]]  in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Euraxess |url = http://www.euraxess.nl/newsletter/archive/may-2013/science-hubs-leiden-bio-science-park |title = Science hubs Leiden Bio Science Park  |accessdate=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of  [[Leiden]] and [[Oegstgeest]] and focuses on companies and Universities in the [[Biotechnology]] sector.

The park comprises 110 hectares (272 acres) with over 60 companies and knowledge-based institutions. The park is located mostly in Leiden and lies between Wassenaarseweg on the north and the Plesmanlaan on the south.

The park focuses mostly on the use of biotechnology for medical and biopharmaceutical applications.

== History ==
[[File:Leiden398.JPG|thumb|Leiden University Medical Centre]]
The LBSP was founded in 1984 in the Leeuwenhoek area west of [[Leiden Centraal railway station|Leiden Central Station]], between the Faculty of Science of the [[Leiden University]] and the former Academic Medical Hospital, known as the [[Leiden University Medical Center|LUMC]]. The municipality decided that this area should primarily be focused on biotechnology.

In 2005 the foundation'' Leiden Life meets Science'' was founded by the Leiden University, the municipality, the LUMC, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center|Naturalis]], [[Kamer van Koophandel|Chamber of Commerce]], the province [[South Holland]], [[University of Applied Sciences Leiden|University of Applied Sciences,]] and the ROC Leiden, with the purpose of growth the park in size and quality.

*"Another common tactic of the deniers is to engage in historical inquiries that on the surface appear legitimate but upon close examination prove to be based on pseudo-science. One prominent example was the investigation of the Auschwitz gas chambers by [[Fred Leuchter]] [...].

*"Leuchter's report contained a considerable amount of scientific, or, as it turned out, pseudo-scientific analysis of chemical residues on the gas chamber walls, and similar matters.

Retrieved on 2008-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt; document authored by American [[Capital punishment|execution]] technician [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Zündel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.

Leuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==
In 1985, [[Ernst Zündel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.

Zündel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt&gt;[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''. Free Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-02-919235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} He was joined by [[David Irving]], an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Zündel's behalf.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them "every step of the way" in spirit.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}}

After arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Report==
The compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Zündel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Before Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:

{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?

THE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.

THE COURT: Who determines that? You?

|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

Leuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Judge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as "ridiculous" and "preposterous", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on "second-hand information", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of "no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:

{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility. As far as I am concerned, from what I've heard, he is not capable of giving that opinion....He is not in a position to say, as he said so sweepingly in this report, what could not have been carried on in these facilities.|sign=Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 9049-9050.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}}}

When questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because "he hasn't any expertise".&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to [[sodium cyanide]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]] with [[DuPont]] was "an on-going thing". DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had "never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter", and had "never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek."&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}

==Claims and criticism==
The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

===Prussian blue===
Leuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.&lt;ref name="ironblues"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].

According to [[Richard J. Green]]:

{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;}}

In other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]
The problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

Since the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as "disingenuous".&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

====Polish follow-up investigation====
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz &amp; Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;

Leuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.&lt;ref name=IFRC/&gt;{{rp|Final Remarks}}

[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]
Accordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.&lt;ref name=confirm&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial''. Verso, 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
By order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide.&lt;ref name=Anatomy563&gt;Karny, Miroslav "The Vrba and Wetzler Report" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', [[Indiana University Press]], 1994; this edition 1998, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations,&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdot.org/learning/myth-fact/leuchter//body/1037|title=HDOT: Learning Tools : Myth/Fact Sheets : Scientific tests prove the "Gas Chambers" never existed|publisher=HDOT.org|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] labels Leuchter's comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as "nonsense".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

====Zyklon B====
Because hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|168}} It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/74908.html|title=Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs) - 74908|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 &amp;ndash; 1810 ppmv&lt;ref name=science/&gt; &amp;ndash; again considerably lower than the [[Flammability limit|lower explosion limit]].

====Gas chamber ventilation====
{{quote|If Leuchter had gone to the archives, if he had spent time in the archives, he would've found evidence about ventilation systems, evidence about ways to introduce Zyklon B into these buildings, evidence of gas chambers, undressing rooms.|Robert Jan van Pelt|''The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter''&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}

A cross section view of the width of the room shows the ventilation channels that straddle the building along its longitudinal axis, marked ''Belüftung'' (aeration) and ''Entlüftungskanal'' (de-aeration channel).]]
Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix HDOT: Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : [The Van Pelt Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302004021/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix |date=2009-03-02 }}: Electronic Edition - IX The Leuchter Report&lt;/ref&gt; The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure&lt;ref name=Anatomy166&gt;Piper, Franciszek, "Gas Chambers and Crematoria" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael.

''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944&lt;ref name=Anatomy238&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sonderkommando]] prisoners wore gas masks when removing the bodies.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; When presented in court with a document by the chief Auschwitz architect SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Karl Bischoff]], Leuchter misconstrued aeration (''Belüftung'') and ventilation (''Entlüftung'') as part of the furnace blower systems, when they were actually in reference to the ventilation channels in the walls that straddle the gas chambers.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; These are visible on blueprints, and can still partly be seen in the ruined east wall of the Crematorium III gas chamber.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

Leuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (''Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung'') of June 28, 1943, from SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Jahrling to SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]] stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

A patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Because the 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month, critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals the true exterminationist purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.&lt;ref name="nizqor1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar01.html|title=66 Questions and Answers about the Holocaust|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn't keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=van Pelt|first=Robert Jan|title=The case for Auschwitz|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=252–253|year=2002|isbn=0-253-34016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adiabatic''' (from ''Gr.'' ἀ ''negative'' + διάβασις ''passage; transference'') refers to any process that occurs without [[heat transfer]].  This concept is used in many areas of physics and engineering. Notable examples are listed below.

==Automobiles==
* [[Engine braking#Diesel engines|Engine braking]], a feature of some diesel engines, uses adiabatic expansion to diminish the vehicle's forward momentum.

==Meteorology==
* [[Adiabatic lapse rate]], the change in air temperature with changing height, resulting from pressure change.

==Quantum chemistry==
* Adiabatic invariant [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]]

==Thermodynamics==
* [[Adiabatic process]]
* [[Adiabatic ionization]]
* [[Adiabatic index]]
* [[Adiabatic accessibility]]

==Quantum mechanics==
* [[Adiabatic theorem]]
* [[Adiabatic quantum motor]]

==Electronics==
* [[Adiabatic circuit]]
* [[Adiabatic logic]]

==Carbohydrate chemistry==

This table was current {{as of|2018|11|27|lc=y|df=US}}.
The columns are defined as follows:
* '''Inventor''': The name of the inventor.
* '''# of patents''': This is the number of [[utility patent]]s that have been issued. Only utility patents (or the international equivalent) are listed, as a utility patent is a patent for an [[invention]]. Not all patents are for inventions. Other patent types include: [[design patent]]s for the ornamental [[design]] of an object; [[plant patent]]s for plant varieties; and [[Reissue application|reissue patents]], where a correction is made to an already granted patent. This list does not include patent applications ([[patents pending]]) as there is no guarantee that a patent application actually describes a novel invention until the patent is granted.
* '''Country''': This is the country of birth or upbringing of the inventor, where known. If unknown, this is the country of residence identified in the inventor's patent filings.
* '''Active''': The first and last year in which an inventor received a patent issuance, except when activity was prior to digital records, in which case year of birth (b) and death (d) may be substituted. If an inventor's first year is 1976 or a few years after, there may be activity prior to this; earlier dates are not present in the primary source, and would require a secondary source.
* '''Main fields of invention''': These are the main areas that the inventor is or was active in.

==Threshold for inclusion==
As the average number of patents per inventor is around 3, some sources define prolific inventors as five times above the average (in terms of patents), leading to a threshold of 15 patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1625743 ''Prolific Inventors: Who are They and Where do They Locate?'' International Centre for Economic Research Working Paper No. 14/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this table currently has an arbitrary cut-off limit for inclusion of 200 patents. This is purely for practical reasons – there are tens of thousands of inventors with more than 15 patents. The threshold of 200 patents means that some famous prolific inventors such as [[Nikola Tesla]] are not included in this list, as Tesla had 111 patents.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Nikola Tesla patents]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspat.com/tesla/ Jim Bieberich's Complete Nikola Tesla U.S. Patent Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of inventions==
This table is a sortable list of the most prolific inventors as measured by utility patents granted. It does not include other types of invention, such as inventions that were never applied for nor granted, for which there is no known source. Nor does the table attempt to measure the significance of an inventor and their inventions. The significance of inventions is often not apparent until many decades after the invention has been made. For recent inventors, it is not yet possible to determine their place in history.

The common symbol for inventiveness, the light bulb, is an example. The first [[incandescent light bulb]] was invented by British [[chemist]] [[Sir Humphry Davy]] in 1802. Many subsequent inventors improved Davy's invention prior to the successful commercialization of electric lighting by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880, 78 years later. Electric lighting continued to be developed. Edison's carbon filament light bulb was made obsolete by the tungsten filament light bulb, invented in 1904 by [[Sándor Just]] and [[Franjo Hanaman]]. It is this that forms the popular conception of a light bulb, though there are other major forms of lighting. The principle of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] was known since 1845, and various inventors, including Edison and [[Nikola Tesla]] worked on them without commercial success. Various improvements were made by many other inventors, until [[General Electric]] introduced "fluorescent lumiline lamps" commercially in 1938, first available to the public at the [[1939 World's Fair]]. [[LED lamps]] also have a long history, with the first [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) invented in 1927 by [[Oleg Losev]]. LEDs were initially of low brightness, and have been used as indicator lamps and [[seven-segment display]]s since 1968. It wasn't until the development of high efficiency blue LEDs by [[Shuji Nakamura]] in the 1980s that white LEDs for lighting applications became practical. Although higher cost than incandescent light bulbs, LEDs have higher efficiency and longer life and may finally displace light bulbs in general lighting applications. In each case, more than 50 years passed between the initial invention and commercial success in general lighting applications.

==Various published lists==
Rankings of prolific inventors have been published at various times. However, until the patent records were digitized, these lists were very tedious to prepare, as many thousands of patent records had to be checked manually. Even after digitization, it is still not a simple process. While the [[USPTO]] keeps statistics for annual rankings of inventions assigned to companies, it no longer publishes rankings of individual inventors. The last such list was published by the USPTO in 1998.&lt;ref name="USPTO list 1988-1997"&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/inv_prol.pdf USPTO publication: Prolific Inventors Receiving Utility Patents 1988-1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, patents predating 1976 have not yet been digitized in the USPTO records. This means that patents before 1976 will not be included in a USPTO search by inventor name, and the number of patents granted before 1976 must be added to current searches.

==Popular Science (1936)==
In January 1936, ''[[Popular Science]]'' published a list of the "most prolific living inventors to be found in America today".&lt;ref name="Popular Science" /&gt;

This list only included U.S. inventors, so omitted Canadian inventor George Albert Lyon, with 993 U.S. patents at the time of publication, Japanese inventor [[Shunpei Yamazaki]], with 745 U.S. patents, and [[Béla Barényi]], with 595 German patents. Also omitted were John F. O'Connor with 949 U.S. patents, and [[Carleton Ellis]], with 753 U.S. patents at the time of publication.

==USA Today (2005)==
On December 13, 2005 [[USA Today]] published a list of "the top 10 living U.S. patent holders":&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-12-13-patent_x.htm  You really can find identities of top patent  holders] USA Today, Dec  13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This table omitted Rick Allen Hamilton II. The USPTO database shows Hamilton was an inventor or co-inventor of 128 US patents granted in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2F%28%22Hamilton%3B+Rick+Allen%22+or+%22Hamilton+II%3B+Rick%22%29+and+apt%2F1+and+isd%2F2012&amp;d=PTXT USPTO Utility Patent Search for Rick Allen Hamilton II for 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; which would place Hamilton at 6th rank for 2012.

==Differences between lists==
Differences in patent numbers between the various lists are due to several reasons:
* The lists were created on different dates. As many of the inventors in the lists are still active, the number of patents they hold are increasing.
* While the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ([[USPTO]]) is the primary source for U.S. patent information, only patents issued since 1976 can be electronically searched by the inventor's name at the USPTO website. For some of the listed inventors, such as [[Thomas Edison]], all of their patents predate 1976, so other sources must be used.
* Often entities list the worldwide total number of patents that they hold. This is not the same as the number of inventions, as a patent in one country may be for the same invention as a patent in another country. The set of patents covering a ''single'' invention in different countries is a [[Patent family]].
* The Time, USA Today and Portfolio lists show the total number of U.S. patents, including patents for designs ([[Design patents]]) as well as patents for inventions ([[Utility patent]]s).
* The annual lists from strutpatent.com list only those patents issued in the particular year to the inventor, not all of the inventor's patents.

'''Liulin-type''' is a class of [[Mass spectrometry|spectrometry]]-[[dosimetry]] instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21177270 | doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq506 | volume=144 | title=Liulin-type spectrometry-dosimetry instruments | year=2011 | journal=Radiat Prot Dosimetry | pages=675–9 | last1 = Dachev Ts | first1 = Dimitrov P | last2 = Tomov | first2 = B | last3 = Matviichuk | first3 = Y | last4 = Spurny | first4 = F | last5 = Ploc | first5 = O | last6 = Brabcova | first6 = K | last7 = Jadrnickova | first7 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The first Liulin device  was developed in 1986-1988 time period for the scientific program of the second Bulgarian cosmonaut for the flight on “MIR” space station.

All Liulin type dosimetric instruments use one or more silicon detectors and measure the deposited energy and number of particles into the detector(s) when charged particles hit the device, that allowing it to calculate the dose rate and particle flux.

The measurements in the LIULIN instrument were based on a single silicon detector followed by a charge-sensitive shaping amplifier (CSA). The number of the pulses at the output of CSA above a given threshold was proportional to the particle flux hitting the detector; the amplitude of the pulses at the output of CSA was proportional to the particles deposited energy. Further the integral of the energy depositions of the particles accumulated in the detector during the measurement interval allowed calculation of the dose rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dachev | first1 = Ts.P. | last2 = Matviichuk | first2 = Yu.N. | last3 = Semkova | first3 = J.V. | last4 = Koleva | first4 = R.T. | last5 = Boichev | first5 = B. | last6 = Baynov | first6 = P. | last7 = Kanchev | first7 = N.A. | last8 = Lakov | first8 = P. | last9 = Ivanov | first9 = Ya.J. | last10 = Tomov | first10 = B.T. | last11 = Petrov | first11 = V.M. | last12 = Redko | first12 = V.I. | last13 = Kojarinov | first13 = V.I. | last14 = Tykva | first14 = R. | year = 1989 | title = Space radiation dosimetry with active detections for the scientific program of the second Bulgarian cosmonaut on board the Mir space station | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(89)90445-6 | journal = Adv.

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

'''Open-notebook science''' is the practice of making the entire primary record of a [[research project]] publicly available online as it is recorded. This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, [[lab notebook|notebook]] of the researcher online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material, as this material is generated. The approach may be summed up by the slogan 'no insider information'. It is the [[logical extreme]] of [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] approaches to research and explicitly includes the making available of failed, less significant, and otherwise unpublished experiments; so called 'dark data'.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-10/st_essay Freeing the Dark Data of Failed Scientific Experiments], Goetz, T., Wired Magazine, Sept.25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of open notebook science, although not the norm in the [[Academia|academic]] community, has gained significant recent attention in the research&lt;ref name="Sanderson, K 2008 273"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanderson, K |title=Data on display |journal=Nature |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1038/455273a |pmid=18800097 |last2=Neylon |first2=C |authorlink2=Cameron Neylon |volume=455 |issue=7211 |pages=273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh, S. |title=Data on display |journal=Cell |date=April 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.04.003 |pmid=18423188 |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=201–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and general&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="live science"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = A. | title = Internet-based tools for communication and collaboration in chemistry | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2008.03.015 | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 13 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 502–506 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18549976| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; media as part of a general trend towards more open approaches in research practice and publishing. Open notebook science can therefore be described as part of a wider open science movement that includes the advocacy and adoption of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publication, [[open data]], [[crowdsourcing]] data, and [[citizen science]]. It is inspired in part by the success of [[open-source software]]&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/84/8430sci1.html|title=Chemical &amp; Engineering News - Serving the chemical, life sciences and laboratory worlds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and draws on many of its ideas.

== History ==

The term "open-notebook science"&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bradley | first1 = J.

Bradley described open-notebook science as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html |title=Open Notebook Science |work=Drexel CoAS E-Learning |first =Jean-Claude |last=Bradley |author-link=Jean-Claude Bradley |date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and indexed on common search engines.

==Benefits ==
A public laboratory notebook makes it convenient to cite the exact instances of experiments used to support arguments in articles.  For example, in a paper on the optimization of a [[Ugi reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bradley, Jean-Claude |author2=Mirza, Khalid |author3=Owens, Kevin |author4=Osborne, Tom |author5=Williams, Antony  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optimization of the Ugi reaction using parallel synthesis and automated liquid handling |journal=Nature Precedings|date=August 2008 |hdl=10101/npre.2008.2237.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/paper03|title=UsefulChem - paper03|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; three different batches of product are used in the characterization and each spectrum references the specific experiment where each batch was used: EXP099,&lt;ref name="EXP099"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP099|title=UsefulChem - EXP099|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EXP203&lt;ref name="EXP203"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP203|title=UsefulChem - EXP203|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and EXP206.&lt;ref name="EXP206"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP206|title=UsefulChem - EXP206|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was subsequently published in the [[Journal of Visualized Experiments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bradley, Jean-Claude |author2=Mirza, Khalid |author3=Owens, Kevin |author4=Osborne, Tom |author5=Williams, Antony  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optimization of the Ugi reaction using parallel synthesis and automated liquid handling |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|date=November 2008 |url=http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=942|doi=10.3791/942 |pmid=19066532 |issue=21 |pmc=2762777 |pages=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the integrity data provenance can be maintained from lab notebook to final publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Without further qualifications, Open Notebook Science implies that the research is being reported on an ongoing basis without unreasonable delay or filter.  This enables others to understand exactly how research actually happens within a field or a specific research group. Such information could be of value to collaborators, prospective students or future employers.  Providing access to selective notebook pages or inserting an embargo period would be inconsistent with the meaning of the term "Open" in this context.  Unless error corrections, failed experiments and ambiguous results are reported, it will not be possible for an outside observer to understand exactly how science is being done.  Terms such as Pseudo&lt;ref name="pseudoONS"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pontiff/2008/06/pseudo_open_notebook_science.php Bacon, David Pseudo Open Notebook Science? from Quantum Pontiff June 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  or Partial&lt;ref name="partialONS"/&gt;  have been used as qualifiers for the sharing of laboratory notebook information in a selective way or with a significant delay.

==Drawbacks ==
The arguments against adopting Open Notebook Science fall mainly into three categories which have differing importance in different fields of science. The primary concern, expressed particularly by biological and medical scientists is that of '[[data theft]]' or 'being scooped'. While the degree to which research groups steal or adapt the results of others remains a subject of debate it is certainly the case that the fear of not being first to publish drives much behaviour, particularly in some fields. This is related to the focus in these fields on the published peer reviewed paper as being the main metric of career success.

The second argument advanced against Open Notebook Science is that it constitutes prior publication, thus making it impossible to [[patentability|patent]] and difficult to publish the results in the traditional [[peer review]]ed literature. With respect to patents, publication on the web is clearly [[Patent infringement|classified as disclosure]]. Therefore, while there may be arguments over the value of patents, and approaches that get around this problem, it is clear that Open Notebook Science is not appropriate for research for which patent protection is an expected and desired outcome. With respect to publication in the peer reviewed literature the case is less clear cut. Most publishers of scientific journals accept material that has previously been presented at a conference or in the form of a preprint. Those publishers that accept material that has been previously published in these forms have generally indicated informally that web publication of data, including Open Notebook Science, falls into this category. Open notebook projects have been successfully published in high [[impact factor]] peer reviewed journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael|last2=Seerden |first2=Jean-Paul |last3=de Gooijer |first3=Jesse |last4=Pouwer |first4=Kees |last5=Olliaro |first5=Piero |last6=Todd |first6=Matthew H.|title=Resolution of Praziquantel|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date=19 September 2011|volume=5|issue=9|pages=e1260|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001260|pmid=21949890|pmc=3176743|editor1-last=Geary|editor1-first=Timothy G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael |author2=Olliaro, Piero |author3=Todd, Matthew H.|title=Open science is a research accelerator|journal=Nature Chemistry|date=22 September 2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=745–748|doi=10.1038/nchem.1149|pmid=21941234|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not been tested with a wide range of publishers. It is to be expected that those publishers that explicitly exclude these forms of pre-publication will not accept material previously disclosed in an open notebook.

The final argument relates to the problem of the 'data deluge'. If the current volume of the peer reviewed literature is too large for any one person to manage, then how can anyone be expected to cope with the huge quantity of non peer reviewed material that could potentially be available, especially when some, perhaps most, would be of poor quality? A related argument is that 'my notebook is too specific' for it to be of interest to anyone else. The question of how to discover high quality and relevant material is a related issue. The issue of curation and validating data and methodological quality is a serious issue and one that arguably has relevance beyond Open Notebook Science but is a particular challenge here.

==Funding and sponsorship==
The [[Open Notebook Science Challenge]],&lt;ref name="ONS Challenge"&gt;[http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/ Open Notebook Science Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; now directed towards reporting solubility measurements in non-aqueous solvent, has received sponsorship from [http://www.submeta.org/ Submeta],&lt;ref name="submeta sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/11/submeta-open-notebook-science-awards.html|title=Useful Chemistry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature magazine|Nature]]&lt;ref name="Nature sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/11/nature-sponsors-open-notebook-science.html|title=Useful Chemistry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sigma-Aldrich]].&lt;ref name="Sigma-Aldrich sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/09/sigma-aldrich-first-official-sponsor-of.html|title=Useful Chemistry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first of ten winners of the contest for December 2008 was Jenny Hale.&lt;ref name="first winner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-submeta-open-notebook-science.html|title=Useful Chemistry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">'''Open peer review''' is a process in which names of [[peer review]]ers of papers submitted to [[academic journal]]s are disclosed to the authors of the papers in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh E, Rooney M, Appleby L, Wilkinson G | title = Open peer review: a randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–51 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10789326 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanrooyen&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Godlee F, Evans S, Black N, Smith R | title = Effect of open peer review on quality of reviews and on reviewers' recommendations: a randomised trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7175 | pages = 23–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9872878 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.318.7175.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as with the ''[[BMJ]]'' and [[BioMed Central]], the process also involves posting the entire pre-publication history of the article online, including not only signed reviews of the article, but also its previous versions and author responses to the reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/authorfaq/medical | title=What is 'open peer review', as operated by the medical journals in the BMC series? | publisher=BioMed Central | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groves T, Loder E | title = Prepublication histories and open peer review at the BMJ | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | issue = sep03 13 | pages = g5394 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25186622 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g5394 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no single definition of open peer review, as it is implemented differently by different academic journals, but it has been broadly defined as "any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford E | title = Open peer review at four STEM journals: an observational overview | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages = 6 | date = 2015-07-20 | pmid = 25767695 | pmc = 4350441 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.6005.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Possible advantages to an open peer-review system include reviewers being "more tactful and constructive" than they would be if they could remain anonymous.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Pros and cons of open peer review | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–8 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10195206 | doi = 10.1038/nature04991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open review leads to more honest reviewing and prevents reviewers from following their individual agendas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review | title=What is peer review? | publisher=Elsevier | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as leading to the detection of reviewers' conflicts of interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benos DJ, Bashari E, Chaves JM, Gaggar A, Kapoor N, LaFrance M, Mans R, Mayhew D, McGowan S, Polter A, Qadri Y, Sarfare S, Schultz K, Splittgerber R, Stephenson J, Tower C, Walton RG, Zotov A | title = The ups and downs of peer review | journal = Advances in Physiology Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–52 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17562902 | doi = 10.1152/advan.00104.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have also found that open peer review is associated with an increase in quality of reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Carole J. | last2 = Sugimoto | first2 = Cassidy R. | last3 =Zhang | first3 = Guo | last4 = Cronin | first4 = Blaise | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bias in peer review | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | date = January 2013 | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–17 | doi = 10.1002/asi.22784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other studies have not found such an association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Delamothe T, Evans SJ | title = Effect on peer review of telling reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted on the web: randomised controlled trial | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | pages = c5729 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21081600 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c5729 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[BioMed Central]] [[medical journal]]s, all of which use open peer review, found that reviewers usually did not notice problems or request changes in reporting of the results of [[randomized trial]]s. The same study found most, but not all, of the requested changes had a positive effect on reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopewell S, Collins GS, Boutron I, Yu LM, Cook J, Shanyinde M, Wharton R, Shamseer L, Altman DG | title = Impact of peer review on reports of randomised trials published in open peer review journals: retrospective before and after study | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | pages = g4145 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24986891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4145 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

A 1999 study found that open peer review did not affect the quality of reviews or the recommendation regarding whether the paper being reviewed should be published, but that it "significantly increased the likelihood of reviewers declining to review".&lt;ref name=vanrooyen/&gt; Open review of abstracts tended to lead to bias favoring authors from English-speaking countries and prestigious academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross JS, Gross CP, Desai MM, Hong Y, Grant AO, Daniels SR, Hachinski VC, Gibbons RJ, Gardner TJ, Krumholz HM | title = Effect of blinded peer review on abstract acceptance | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 14 | pages = 1675–80 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16609089 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.14.1675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open peer review could lead to authors accumulating enemies who try to keep their papers from being published or their grant applications from being successful.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

It focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of [[knowledge]], and how these shape and are shaped by different political economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/985364619|title=The Routledge Handbook of the Political Economy of Science|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|others=Tyfield, David, et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Postnormal times''' ('''PNT''') is a concept developed by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as a development of [[Post-normal Science]]. Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

'''Practice research''' is a form of academic [[research]] which incorporates an element of practice in the [[methodology]] or research output.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Rather than seeing the relationship between practice and theory as a dichotomy, as has sometimes traditionally been the case (see [[academia]]: theory and practice heading), there is a growing body of practice research academics across a number of disciplines who use practice as part of their research. For example, the [[practice-based research network]] (PBRN) within clinical [[medical research]].

==Practice-led research in the arts and design==
Within [[arts]] and [[humanities]] departments there are ongoing debates about how to define this emerging research phenomenon, and there are a variety of models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based, practice-led, mixed-mode research practice and practice through research), see for example [[screen media practice research]]. The potential, nature and scope for this research has been debated from the 1990s. Sir Christopher Frayling in 1993 adapted Herbert Read's model of education through art to describe different ways of thinking about research, noting that research could be FOR practice, where research aims are subservient to practice aims, THROUGH practice, where the practice serves a research purpose, or INTO practice, such as observing the working processes of others.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, C. (1993) Research in art and design. Royal College of Art: Research
Paper&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Archer's statement in 1995 shows the growing recognition of arts practice as research at this time, "There are circumstances where the best or only way to shed light on a proposition, a principle, a material, a process or a function is to attempt to construct something, or to enact something, calculated to explore, embody or test it.".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, B. (1995) The Nature of Research Co-Design Jan 95 6-13&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the acceptance of practice research in these disciplines to be reviewed alongside traditional research disciplines in the sphere of [[Higher Education]] a debate supported by the work of Michael Biggs, John Freeman, Kristina Niedderer, Katy Macleod, Darren Newbury and others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The UK's [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] had a steering committee devoted to practice-led research and its report was completed in September 2007.,&lt;ref&gt;AHRC Research Review: Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (2007) 
Rust, Prof Chris, Mottram, Prof Judith, Till, Prof Jeremy, with support from Kirsty Smart, Peter Walters Mark Elshaw&lt;/ref&gt; titled AHRC Research Review in Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (Rust, Mottram, Till). This informed continuing discussions by the Council for Higher Education in Art &amp; Design (CHEAD) and the AHRC resulting in an evolved notion of practice as research in art, design and architecture, media, and creative writing. This in turn brought an increasing recognition in the UK of the ways in which creative departments contribute to research culture, a potential which informs elements of the Research Excellence Framework 2014.

A '''preference test''' is an experiment in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ in one or more ways.  Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured with respect to the alternative environments, such as latency and frequency of entry, duration of time spent, range of activities observed, or relative consumption of a goal object in the environment. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software.&lt;ref name="Cunningham, (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = C. | last2 = Gremel | first2 = C. | last3 = Groblewski | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Drug-induced conditioned place preference and aversion in mice | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1662–1670 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see "Advantages and disadvantages" below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred.   Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the environments to [[Habituation|habituate]] and reduce the effects of novelty.

Preference tests can be used to test for preferences of only one characteristic of an environment, e.g. cage colour, or multiple characteristics e.g. a choice between [[hamster wheel]], [[Habitrail]] tunnels or additional empty space for extended locomotion.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | year = 1998 | title = The use and perceived importance of three resources which provide caged laboratory mice the opportunity of extended locomotion | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 353–367 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(97)00049-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of test ==

=== Two choices ===
The simplest of preference tests offers a choice between two alternatives.  This can be done by putting different goal boxes at the ends of the arms of a [[T-maze|'T' shaped maze]], or having a chamber divided in into differing halves.  A famous example of this simple method is an investigation of the preferences of [[chickens]] for different types of wire floor in [[battery cages]].  Two types of metal mesh flooring were being used in the 1950s; one type was a large, open mesh using thick wire, the other was a smaller mesh size but the wire was considerably thinner.  A prestigious committee, the Brambell Committee, conducting an investigation into farm animal welfare&lt;ref name="Thorpe, (1965)"&gt;Thorpe, W.H., (1965).  The assessment of pain and distress in animals. Appendix III in report of the technical committee to enquire into the welfare of animals kept under intensive husbandry conditions, F.W.R.Brambell (chairman). H.M.S.O., London&lt;/ref&gt; concluded the thicker mesh should be used as this was likely to be more comfortable for the chickens.  However, preference tests showed that chickens preferred the thinner wire.  Photographs taken from under the cages showed that the thinner mesh offered more points of contact for the feet than the thick mesh, thereby spreading the load on the hens' feet and presumably feeling more comfortable to the birds.

=== Multiple choices ===
The number of choices that can be offered is theoretically limitless for some preference tests, e.g., light intensity, cage size, food types; however, the number is often limited by experimental practicalities, current practice (e.g., animal caging systems) or costs.  Furthermore, animals usually investigate all areas of the apparatus in a behaviour called "information gathering", even those with minor preference, so the more choices that are available may dilute the data on the dominant preference(s).

=== Choices with a cost ===
{{main article|Consumer demand tests (animals)}} 
Most preference tests involve no 'cost' for making a choice, so they do not indicate the strength of an animals motivation or need to obtain the outcome of the choice.  For example, if a laboratory mouse is offered three sizes of cage space it may prefer one of them, but this choice does not indicate whether the mouse 'needs' that particular space, or whether it has a relatively slight preference for it. To measure an animals motivation toward a choice one may perform a "consumer demand test." In this sort of test, the choice involves some "cost" to the animal, such as physical effort (e.g., lever pressing, weighted door).

== Uses ==

Preference tests have been used widely in the study of animal behaviour and motivation, e.g.:

=== Animal housing and husbandry ===
* Colour of cages for laboratory mice&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Glenn, (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Glen | first2 = E.F. | year = 2003 | title = Cage colour preferences and effects of home-cage colour on anxiety in laboratory mice | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1085–1092 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Desire to self-select [[anxiolytic|stress-reducing drugs]] in barren cages&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Olsson, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Olsson | first2 = I.A.S. | year = 2004 | title = Housing conditions affect self-administration of anxiolytic by laboratory mice | url = | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 33–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory capacities ===
* Illumination preferences and sensory capacity of [[Domesticated turkey|turkeys]]&lt;ref name="Moinard and Sherwin, (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moinard | first1 = C. | last2 = Sherwin | first2 = C.M. | year = 1999 | title = Turkeys prefer fluorescent light with supplementary ultraviolet radiation | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 261–267 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(99)00043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal welfare ===
* Cognitive bias studies&lt;ref name="Harding et al., (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harding | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Paul | first2 = E.S | last3 = Mendl | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Animal Behaviour: Cognitive bias and affective state | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = | page = 312 | doi =  10.1038/427312a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal communication ===
* Social learning&lt;ref name="Sherwin et al., (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Heyes | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Nicol | first3 =  | year = 2002 | title = Social learning influences the preferences of domestic hens for novel food | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 933–942 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human pharmacology ===
* The [[radial arm maze]] has been used to assess how drugs affect memory performance. It has also been shown to be responsive in distinguishing the cognitive affects of an array of toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2902540 |year=1988 |last1=Levin |first1=ED |title=Psychopharmacological effects in the radial-arm maze |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=169–75 |journal=[[Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews]] |doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(88)80008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preferences of wild animals ===
* There have been relatively few studies on the preferences of wild animals.  A recent study has shown that [[feral pigeon]]s do not discriminate drinking water according to its content of metabolic wastes, such as [[uric acid]] or [[urea]] (mimicking faeces- or urine-pollution by birds or mammals respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Olah G, Rózsa L | title=Nitrogen metabolic wastes do not influence drinking water preference in feral pigeons| format=pdf| journal=[[Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae]]| year=2006| volume=52|issue=4|pages= 401–406| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/olah_rozsa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
* A major advantage of preference tests is that we can gain objective data about animal motivation from the animal's perspective (largely) without being influenced by [[Anthropomorphic|attributing human emotions]] or [[Anthropocentric|human senses]] to the animals.

=== Disadvantages and limitations ===
* Preference tests give an indication only of relative preferences for the offered variants, not the absolute need for any of the variants. This can be overcome by placing costs on gaining access to the variants&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1983)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M.S. | year = 1983 | title = Battery hens name their price: consumer demand theory and the measurement of ethological 'needs' | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1195–1205 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(83)80026-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(see above).
* Animals can only make a choice between the variants offered. These might be limited by our current understanding of the animals' motivations and senses.
* Some variants may offer substitutability of use.  For example, offering semi-aquatic [[mink]] a bath of water means the water can be used for swimming, drinking and washing, rather than just one activity ''per se''.&lt;ref name="Mason et al., (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = G. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | last3 = Clarebrough | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The welfare of fur-farmed mink | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = | pages = 35–36 | doi=10.1038/35065157 | pmid=11242031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preference tests sometimes allow access to the variants outside of the testing period ('open economy'), thereby allowing compensatory access outside of the period of observation.  More rigorous studies prevent this access ('closed economy').
* It can be difficult to account for minority preferences.  For example, consider the duration of human occupation of rooms in a house as an indication of preference.  We probably occupy the [[living room]] and [[bedroom]] for the greatest durations of time, indicating these are the most preferred rooms; however, although we probably spend least time in the [[bathroom]], making it the minority preference, this does not necessarily mean the bathroom is the least preferred room at all times of the day, i.e. minority preference can be important.
* Preferences can vary throughout the day.  Well designed studies can account for this complication.
* Animals sometimes behave for proximate considerations rather than ultimate [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. For example, a dog which has had a painful visit to the vet may prefer not to go to the vet subsequently even though it will ultimately benefit the dog's health.
* 'Inappropriate' responses.  This happens particularly when the animals have not evolved appropriate responses to the offered variants.  For example, rats will show a preference for [[saccharin]] solution compared to unadulterated water.&lt;ref name="Tordoff et al., (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tordoff | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Alarcon | first2 = L.K. | last3 = Lawler | first3 = M.P. | year = 2008 | title = Preferences of 14 rat strains for 17 taste compounds | url = | journal = Physiology and Behavior | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 308–332 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.06.010 | pmc = 2642481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the saccharin has been designed to taste as if it contains nutrients (sugars) although it does not.

'''PubPeer''' is a website that allows users to discuss and review scientific research.

The site is one of many allowing academics to engage in [[Peer review#Postpublication reviews|post-publication peer review]], and has highlighted shortcomings in several high-profile papers, in some cases leading to [[retractions]] and to accusations of [[scientific fraud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=researcher admits mistakes in stem cell study|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/2013/05/27/researcher-admits-mistakes-in-stem-cell-study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2013-05/klonen-studie-fehler-mitalipov-reaktion|title=Zellbiologe gibt Fehler in Klonstudie zu|date=2013-05-23|author=Sven Stockrahm|author2=Lydia Klöckner|author3=Dagny Lüdemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stem cell cloner acknowledges errors in ground breaking paper|url=http://www.nature.com/news/stem-cell-cloner-acknowledges-errors-in-groundbreaking-paper-1.13060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stapgate shows Japan must get back to basics in science|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U2skY8fTZss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public awareness of science''' ('''PAwS'''), '''public understanding of science''' ('''PUS'''), or more recently, '''Public Engagement with Science and Technology''' ('''PEST''') are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages [[science]], [[technology]], and [[innovation]] have among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savaget|first1=Paulo|last2=Acero|first2=Liliana|title=Plurality in understandings of innovation, sociotechnical progress and sustainable development: An analysis of OECD expert narratives|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=2017|doi=10.1177/0963662517695056}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the [[information deficit model]] of [[science communication]], the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public [[uses and gratifications theory|chooses to use]] scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between [[expertise|expert]] and [[layperson|lay]] understandings of an issue.{{examples|date=October 2015}}

== Major themes ==
The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as:
* [[Science communication]] in the [[mass media]], [[Internet]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programmes
* [[Science museums]], [[aquarium|aquaria]], [[planetarium|planetaria]], [[zoo|zoological parks]], [[botanical garden]]s, etc.
* Public controversies over science and technology
* Fixed and mobile science exhibits
* [[Science festival]]s
* [[Science fair]]s in schools and social groups
* [[Science education]] for adults
* Science and [[social movement]]s
* Media and science ([[Mediatization (media)|medialisation]] of science)
* [[Consumer education]]
* [[Citizen science]]
* Public tours of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) parks, manufacturing companies, etc.
* [[Science in popular culture]]
* Science in text books and classrooms
* Science and art

How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[bioethics]], etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Divided Expectations: Why We Need a New Dialogue about Science, Inequality, and Society |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18-19 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619185052/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/divided_expectations |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bodmer report==
The publication of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]]' report ''The Public Understanding of Science&lt;ref name=RS-Bodmer-report&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Royal Society|title=The Public Understanding of Science|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/1985/public-understanding-science/|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' (or ''Bodmer Report'') in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report led to the foundation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contextualist model ==
In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of [[Cumbria]]n Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in [[England]], where [[Brian Wynne]] demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wynne|first=Brian|date=1996|chapter=Misunderstood Misunderstandings: Social Identities and the Public Uptake of Science|url=|editors=Alan Irwin and Brian Wynne |title=Misunderstanding Science? The Public Reconstruction of Science and Technology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19–46|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)]]. The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the  bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.

== The deliberative turn ==
The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science  through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like [[Sheila Jasanoff]] argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasanoff|first=Sheila|date=2003|title=Breaking the Waves in Science Studies: Comment on H.M. Collins and Robert Evans, 'The Third Wave of Science Studies'|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=389–400|doi=10.1177/03063127030333004|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lövbrand, Eva, Roger Pielke, Jr. and Silke Beck|first=|date=2011|title=A Democracy Paradox in Studies of Science and Technology|url=|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=474–496|doi=10.1177/0162243910366154|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring public understanding of science ==
Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:

=== 1. Factual knowledge ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list&lt;ref name="Eveland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eveland|first1=William|title=How Web Site Organization Influences Free Recall, Factual Knowledge, and Knowledge Structure Density|journal=Human Communications Research|volume=30|issue=2|pages=208–233|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00731.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Cued Recall]]: Answering a specific question without a list of choices &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Free Recall]]: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== 2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Scaled survey responses to questions such as "How well informed you would say you are about this topic?"&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge? Comparing operationalizations of scientific understanding|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=39|pages=761–774|doi=10.1093/scipol/scs048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one’s knowledge &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;

=== 3. Structural knowledge: ===
The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an “X” in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
* Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as “I tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences” &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key Assumptions: ====
* The use of [[Elaborative interrogation|elaboration]] increases the likelihood of remembering information &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== Mixed use of the three measures ===
* While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they “do not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures." &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt; Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;
* Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

== Project examples ==
Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as [[Dana Foundation]]'s "[[Brain Awareness Week]]," are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science.

The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAWS off science?|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1998|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/33/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vega Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk|title=The Vega Science Trust - Science Video - Homepage|work=vega.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public.

The [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science]] chair at [[The University of Oxford]] was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|title=Professor Richard Dawkins - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025233/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]]. Mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|title=Professor Marcus du Sautoy - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181656/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|archivedate=2010-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including [[Richard Fortey]] and [[Kathy Sykes]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] at [[Manchester University]], [[Tanya Byron]] at [[Edge Hill University]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and [[Alice Roberts]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">A '''research program''' ([[United Kingdom|UK]]: '''research programme''') is a professional network of scientists conducting [[basic research]].  The term was used by [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Imre Lakatos]] to blend and revise the [[normative]] model of science offered by [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]]'s ''[[falsificationism]]'' and the descriptive model of science offered by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[normal science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, auth, John Worrall &amp; Gregory Currie, eds, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Methodology_of_Scientific_Research_P.html?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C ''The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Volume 1: Philosophical Papers''] (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lakatos found falsificationism impractical and often not practiced, and found normal science—where a ''paradigm of science'', mimicking an ''exemplar'', extinguishes differing perspectives—more [[monopoly|monopolistic]] than actual.

[[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]] found that many research programmes coexisted. Each had a ''hard core'' of theories immune to revision, surrounded by a ''protective belt'' of malleable theories.&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;William Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science: An Overview for Cognitive Science'' (Hillsdale NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc, 1988), ch 4 "Post-positivist philosophy of science", subch "Lakatosian research programmes", pp 60-63&lt;/ref&gt;  A research programme vies against others to be most ''progressive''.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;  Extending the research programme's theories into new domains is ''theoretical progress'', and experimentally corroborating such is ''empirical progress'', always refusing falsification of the research programme's hard core.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;  A research programme might ''degenerate''—lose progressiveness—but later return to progressiveness.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

A '''research proposal''' is a document [[wikt:proposal|proposing]] a [[research]] project, generally in the [[science]]s or [[academia]], and generally constitutes a request for [[funding of science|sponsorship]] of that research.&lt;ref name="bizdict"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research proposal|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/research-proposal.html|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals are evaluated on the cost and potential impact of the proposed research, and on the soundness of the proposed plan for carrying it out.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Paul T. P.|title=How to Write a Research Proposal|url=http://www.meaning.ca/archives/archive/art_how_to_write_P_Wong.htm|publisher=International Network on Personal Meaning|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research proposals generally address several key points:&lt;ref name="uiac"&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing a Research Proposal|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/learn/research/proposal.html|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt;
* What [[research question]](s) will be addressed, and [[research design|how]] they will be addressed
* How much time and [[cost estimate|expense]] will be required for the research
* What [[literature review|prior research]] has been done on the topic
* How the results of the research will be evaluated
* How the research will benefit the sponsoring organization and other parties

==Types==
Research proposals may be ''solicited'', meaning that they are submitted in response to a request with specified requirements, such as a [[request for proposal]], or they may be ''unsolicited'', meaning they are submitted without prior request. Other types of proposals include "preproposals", where a [[letter of intent]] or brief [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] is submitted for review prior to submission of a full proposal; continuation proposals, which re-iterate an original proposal and its funding requirements in order to ensure continued funding; and renewal proposals, which seek continued sponsorship of a project which would otherwise be terminated.&lt;ref name="uiac"/&gt;

Academic research proposals are generally written as part of the initial requirements of writing a [[thesis]], [[Academic paper|research paper]], or dissertation. They generally follow the same format as a research paper, with an introduction, a [[literature review]], a discussion of research [[methodology]] and goals, and a conclusion. This basic structure may vary between projects and between fields, each of which may have its own requirements.

It was originally based on [[St. Stephen's Green]],  moving in 1911 to [[Government Buildings|a purpose-built "Royal College of Science" building]] on [[Merrion Street]]. In 1926 it was absorbed into [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) as the [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] of Science and Engineering.

The Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the [[Dublin Castle administration]] in 1845, with chemist [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]] as curator, and a focus on [[mining in Ireland]] similar to the [[Geological Museum|Museum of Practical Geology]] in London.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380225 p.ix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|title=The Museum of Irish Industry|work=Permanent Exhibitions &gt; Out of Storage|publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]]|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216193808/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|archivedate=16 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Kane was promoted to director, expanding its remit, and renaming it the [[Museum of Irish Industry]] (MII).&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1853 a new [[Science and Art Department]] was created within [[Government of the United Kingdom|the Whitehall administration]], and in 1854 the MII placed under its remit.&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380230 p.xiv]&lt;/ref&gt; A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created, modelled on the [[Royal School of Mines]] in London, with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (RDS).&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"/&gt; The MII and School shared premises at 51, St. Stephen's Green, acquired in 1846 and fitted out by 1852.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1864, a [[select committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380239 p.xxiii §§5–8]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[HM Treasury]] agreed and in 1867 a commission was appointed by the education committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The commission, headed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college, and the RCScI mission statement on 11 September 1867 was:&lt;ref name="ucdarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/archives/html/university/rcsi.htm|title=Royal College of Science in Ireland|work=Archives|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The object of the Royal College of Science is to supply as far as practicable a Complete Course of instruction in Science applicable to the Industrial Arts, especially those which may be classed broadly under the heads of Mining, Agriculture, Engineering, and Manufactures, and to aid in the instruction of Teachers for the local Schools of Science

[[George Sigerson]] complained in 1868 that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Ireland: Its Vital Questions, Secret Societies, and Government |url=https://archive.org/details/modernirelandit00sigegoog |chapterurl=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/ModIrelandRoyalCollege/index.php |year=1868 |publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer |location=London |pages=197–207 |chapter=The Royal College of Science for Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
The RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include "Physics and Natural Science".&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt;  The number of students enrolled increased gradually.&lt;ref name="ivrla30371"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ucd.ie/view/ivrla:30371|title=RCSI numbers of attendence &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|date=1 December 2009|work=UCD Digital Library|publisher=UCD|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898 the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Descriptive Geometry and Engineering.&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt; In 1900, control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin, headed by [[Horace Plunkett]].&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"/&gt; A new building was proposed in 1897 and a site from [[Merrion Street]] to [[Kildare Street]] was chosen in 1898; in 1899 the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college.&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/newbuilding.html|title=The New Building|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]]; the [[foundation stone]] was laid in 1904 by [[Edward VII]] and it was opened in 1911 by [[George V]].&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"/&gt;

In 1926 the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties. Science moved to [[National Concert Hall|UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building]], and on to [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]]  in the 1960s; Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in 1989. The RCScI building was then absorbed into [[Government Buildings]] with the rest of Aston Webb's complex, lavishly renovated by [[Charles Haughey]] and used to house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government_Buildings/|title=History of Government Buildings: 1904-1922 and 1990|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''science of team science''' ('''SciTS''') field encompasses both conceptual and methodological [[Strategy|strategies]] aimed at understanding and enhancing the processes and outcomes of collaborative, team-based [[research]]. It is useful to distinguish between team science (TS) initiatives and the science of team science (SciTS) field.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Hall | first2=Kara L. | last3=Taylor | first3=Brandie K. | last4=Moser | first4=Richard P. | title=The Science of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.002 | pmid=18619407|pages=S77–S89|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Science%20of%20Team%20Science%20Intro.pdf?uniq=-ftp6c5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokols Misra Moser Hall 2008 pp. S96–S115"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stokols | first=Daniel | last2=Misra | first2=Shalini | last3=Moser | first3=Richard P. | last4=Hall | first4=Kara L. | last5=Taylor | first5=Brandie K. | title=The Ecology of Team Science | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=35 | issue=2 | year=2008 | issn=0749-3797 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.003 | pages=S96–S115|url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/dstokols/Pubs/AJPM-Ecology%20of%20Team%20Science.pdf?uniq=-ftp6bz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, [[interdisciplinary|inter]]-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena. The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science. Its principal units of analysis are the [[research]], [[training]], and community-based translational initiatives implemented by both public and private sector organizations.

The SciTS field focuses on understanding and enhancing the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science initiatives, including their scientific discoveries, educational outcomes, and translations of research findings into new practices, [[Patent|patents]], products, technical advances, and policies.

==History==
Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest and investment in large-scale, team-based research initiatives to address complex and multifaceted problems that require cross-disciplinary collaboration.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wuchty S |author2=Jones BF |author3=Uzzi B | title=The increasing dominance of teams in production of knowledge. | journal=Science | year= 2007 | volume= 316 | issue= 5827 | pages= 1036–9 | pmid=17431139 | doi=10.1126/science.1136099 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17431139 | bibcode=2007Sci...316.1036W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones BF |author2=Wuchty S |author3=Uzzi B | title=Multi-university research teams: shifting impact, geography, and stratification in science. | journal=Science | year= 2008 | volume= 322 | issue= 5905 | pages= 1259–62 | pmid=18845711 | doi=10.1126/science.1158357 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18845711 | bibcode=2008Sci...322.1259J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in team science parallels the increase in specialization among scientists. The rapid growth and accumulation of specialized knowledge in multiple fields has created a substantial need to establish partnerships among scientists and practitioners drawn from several different fields in order to address complex [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[social]], and public [[health]] problems.&lt;ref name="pmid17431139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18845711"/&gt;

The interdiscipline of SciTS initially emerged from practical concerns on the part of funding agencies, which needed to gauge the performance of team science, understand its added value, determine the return on investment of large research initiatives, and inform science policy&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The term "science of team science" was first introduced in October, 2006, at a conference called The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research, hosted by the [[National Cancer Institute]], in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/scienceteam/index.html National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Web site.] Accessed May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging SciTS field was further developed in a supplement to the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]'', published in July 2008. Two years later, the First Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference was held on April 22–24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois, organized by the [[Northwestern University]] Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. The Chicago conference brought together team science investigators and practitioners from a broad range of disciplines, including [[translational science|translational research]]; [[organizational behavior]]; [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[health psychology]]; communications; complex systems; evaluation science; technology; and management.

As a nascent field of inquiry, the terminology, methodologies, and outcomes of SciTS are still being debated and defined, and new hypotheses regarding the most effective strategies for implementing and sustaining team science are beginning to be tested and the results published. While the SciTS literature base is currently limited, the field is founded on a substantial body of knowledge of team research conducted by scholars in diverse fields such as organizational science, community health promotion, and social psychology, as well as from groups outside academia, including business and the military. SciTS research findings are starting to be translated into evidence-based tools and support structures that aim to improve the efficiency and success of team science initiatives.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;

In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences established a National Research Council Committee on the Science of Team Science to evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice in the SciTS field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Science of Team Science | website=National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | date=2013-01-11 | url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BBCSS/CurrentProjects/DBASSE_080231 | ref={{sfnref | National Academies Web Server sites.nationalacademies.org | 2013}} | access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Committee report was published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science p. "&gt;{{cite book | title=Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science | publisher=National Academies Press | publication-place=Washington, D.C. | date=2015-07-15 | isbn=978-0-309-31682-8 | doi=10.17226/19007 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The methods and measures used to evaluate team science are complex and evolving with the interdiscipline of SciTS.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; The definition of a successful team may be different depending on the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]. For example, [[Funding of science|funding agencies]] may be more interested in performance measures related to the translation of team research findings to practical applications, whereas team researchers may use the number of publications produced and amount grant funding obtained to gauge the success of a team science endeavor. In addition, the method of evaluation and metrics of success may vary at different points during the team research project. Short-term measures may include indicators of synergistic output, whereas long-term measures may be related to the impact of the research on the evolution of a discipline or the development of public policy.

SciTS uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science, as well as the organizational, social, and political context that influences team science.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt; These methods include approaches such as surveys, ethnographic observation, case studies, and interviews of members of science teams; [[social network analysis|social network]], mapping and visualization techniques (e.g., graphical representations of collaboration formation and dissolution, geographic distribution of collaborators, funding patterns, patent awards, time to production and commercialization, etc.); and [[bibliometrics|bibliometric]] analyses (e.g., assessment of co-authored papers and grants).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The field would benefit from science agencies and associated policies to put into place advanced computational infrastructures, which will enable the analysis of terabytes of data to identify the factors that contribute to or hinder the success of science teams.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ideally, evaluation of team science initiatives is performed in real time, during active collaborations, so that the information results can be fed back to the scientific team to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

==Tools==
Scientists engaged in team science collaborations have traditionally relied on [[heuristics]] to make team science work. Through only their own experiences—what might be called the art of team science—they have tried to discern what facilitates team science and what obstacles stand in the way of a collaboration’s success. By studying the practice of team science, SciTS researchers aim to develop a set of evidence-based tools and recommendations that can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of team science initiatives. For example, SciTS researchers may identify approaches to facilitate the formation and function of successful collaborative science teams, remove inter-institutional barriers to team science, support effective collaboration among researchers who work together within a team, and develop team science training programs.&lt;ref name="pmid18619407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiore SM. Interdisciplinarity as teamwork: how the science of teams can inform team science. ''Small Group Res''. 2008;39:251–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress is being made on a few fronts toward the development of practical tools and recommendations to support the team science process. The SciTS research community is working toward the creation of an evidence base for the development of a set of "effective practices", which can be incorporated into team science training to ensure that the next generation of scientists develops the skills necessary to engage in effective team science. Several groups are developing team science "[[Toolbox|toolboxes]]" or "[[List of toolkits|toolkits]]" that provide resources that can assist researchers with the collaborative science process, including guiding questions that support discussion on collaborative goals and common metrics of success and assigning individual tasks and responsibilities; guidelines for developing a shared "[[language]]" that can be used among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds; models for communications infrastructure that can support geographically dispersed collaborations; tools for assessing team members' readiness to collaborate; curricula for training team members in skills for team science; and model "[[prenuptial agreements]]" for collaborators that can help to establish agreement on rights to authorship and patents that result from scientific collaborations. Other groups are developing online social networking tools to help scientists identify potential collaborators, and creating centralized databases of measures and instruments that can be used by SciTS researchers, program evaluators, or those who are engaged in team science to assess the processes and outcomes of team science initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">A '''Science Shop''' is a facility, often attached to a specific department of a [[university]] or an [[NGO]], that provides independent participatory research support in response to concerns experienced by civil society. It's a demand-driven and bottom-up approach to research. Their work can be described as community-based research (CBR). Science Shops were first established in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1970s and their main function is to increase both public awareness and to provide access to [[science]] and [[technology]] to laymen or [[non-profit organization]]s.

In practice, this means civil society organizations will have access to scientific research at low or no cost. Science Shops that are based at universities give students opportunities to do community-based research as part of their curriculum. Science Shops are not restricted to the [[natural science]]s. They can cover topics in all scientific disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to [[social sciences]] and humanities.

Science Shops are managed and operated by both permanent staff members and students who screen questions provided by members of civil society. Science Shop staff use these questions to provide challenging problems to both research students and university faculty members in hope of finding solutions to the question. Students who participate in Science Shop projects often can acquire credits toward their degree. Also, many students do their postgraduate work on problems referred to by Science Shops.

Myriad Science Shops have developed expertise in specific areas. For example, the first Science Shop attached to the [[chemistry]] department at [[Utrecht University]] was particularly skilled in evaluation reports on soil analysis.

Clients are often directed to the Science Shop that is best suited to address their particular concerns. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] system has provided many benefits e.g. to environmentalists, workers, and social workers. Science Shops, in general, have aided environmentalists in better analyzing industrial pollutants, and helped workers to better evaluate the safety and employment consequences of new production processes. Moreover, they have enhanced the understanding of social workers in how to deal with disaffected teenagers.

The Dutch system has inspired Science Shops in nations across [[Europe]] such as [[Denmark]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], the [[UK]], [[Belgium]], [[Romania]] and [[Portugal]] . Moreover, there are currently Science Shops in countries outside of Europe such as [[Canada]]. The University of Waterloo Science Shop [http://www.scienceshop.ca] in Canada is a community service centre for knowledge transfer. Science Shops around the world are linked through the International Science Shop network [http://www.livingknowledge.org Living Knowledge]. The network’s aim is to foster public engagement with, and participation in, all levels of the research and innovation process. The Living Knowledge network is open for all organisations that are interested in community based research and the concept of Science Shops.

== Science Shops and the EU ==
The European Commission (EC), which initiates and implements EU policies and spends EU funds, has been an important factor behind the international interest and progress of the Science Shop movement. The EC has financed studies and projects, such as SCIPAS, InterActs, ISSNET and TRAMS which contributed to the development of new Science Shops.

The most recent projects, namely PERARES (Public Engagement in Research and Researchers Engaging with Society), EnRRICH (Enhancing Responsible Research and Innovation through Curricula in Higher Education) and SciShops received funding from the European Union’s 7th Framework Programme and the [[Horizon 2020]] research and innovation programme.

=== PERARES Project ===
The Public Engagement with Research And Research Engagement with Society ([http://www.livingknowledge.org/projects/perares/ PERARES]) project was a four years project funded by the European Community’s 7th Framework Programme. The project started in 2010 and aimed to strengthen public engagement in research (PER) by involving researchers and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the formulation of research agendas and the research process. It used various debates (or dialogues) on Science to actively articulate research request of civil society. These are forwarded to research institutes and results are used in the next phase of the debate. Thus, these debates move ‘upstream’ into agenda settings. For this, partners linked existing debate formats – such as science café’s, science festivals, online-forums – with the Science Shop network - already linking civil society and research institutes. To be able to answer to research requests, it was necessary to enlarge and strengthen the network of research bodies doing research for/with CSOs. Thus, ten new Science Shop like facilities throughout Europe are started, mentored by experienced partners. Guidelines to evaluate the impact of engagement activities are developed and tested.

=== EnRRICH Project ===
The Enhancing Responsible Research and Innovation through Curricula in Higher Education ([http://www.livingknowledge.org/projects/enrrich/ EnRRICH]) project will run from July 2015 – December 2017. It will improve the capacity of students and staff in higher education to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes to support the embedding of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in curricula by responding to the research needs of society as expressed by civil society organisations (CSOs). To reach this aim, the project will identify, develop, pilot and disseminate good practice and relevant resources to embed the 5 RRI policy agendas ’Public Engagement’, ‘Science Education’, ‘Open Access’, ‘Ethics’ and ‘Gender’ in academic curricula across Europe. Through sharing learning and initiating discussion and debates at institutional, national and international levels both within the project consortium and beyond it, the EnRRICH project will create a better awareness of, and enhance the policy context for, RRI in curricula and thereby produce more responsible and responsive graduates and researchers.

=== SciShops Project ===
The [http://www.scishops.eu/ SciShops] project will run from September 2017 to February 2020. Its aim is to build on and expand the capacity of the Science Shops ecosystem in Europe and beyond. As part of the SciShops project, at least ten new university- and non-university-based Science Shops will be established in Europe by project partners. The SciShops team aims to demonstrate the benefits of starting a Science Shop for different kinds of organisation, as well as to show how civil society gains from collaborating with Science Shops in community-based participatory research.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:
* '''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) – This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]".
* '''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) – Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}).
The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} &amp; {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).

==History==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747–768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&amp;mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})

Earlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms "task fit" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604–634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal

==Alternative models==
# The '''MPT model''': Independent of TAM, Scherer ({{harvnb|Scherer|1986}}) developed the [[matching person and technology model]] in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), "Living in the State of Stuck", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a "theory" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM "has diverted researchers' attention away from other 
important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the 
independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).

Legris et al.&lt;ref&gt;Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).

A study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. &amp; Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.

'''''Vis viva''''' (from the [[Latin]] for "living force") is a historical term used for the first (known) description of what we now call [[kinetic energy]] in an  early formulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]].

==Overview==
Proposed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] over the period 1676–1689, the theory was controversial as it seemed to oppose the theory of [[conservation of momentum]] advocated by Sir [[Isaac Newton]] and [[René Descartes]]. The two theories are now understood to be complementary.

The theory was eventually absorbed into the modern theory of [[energy]] though the term still survives in the context of [[celestial mechanics]] through the [[Vis-viva equation|''vis viva'' equation]].

The term is due to  [[Germany|German]] [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who during 1676–1689 first attempted a mathematical formulation. Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' each with [[velocity]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') the quantity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was conserved. He called this quantity the ''vis viva'' or "living force" of the system. The principle, it is now realised, represents an accurate statement of the conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in [[elastic collision]]s, and is independent of the [[conservation of momentum]]. However, many [[physicist]]s at the time were unaware of this fact and, instead, were influenced by the prestige of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in [[England]] and of [[René Descartes]] in [[France]], both of whom advanced the [[conservation of momentum]] as a guiding principle. Thus the [[momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!\sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;

was held by the rival camp to be the conserved ''vis viva''. It was largely [[engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[Karl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] who objected that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and who made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]].

The French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]], who had a sound grasp of Newtonian mechanics, developed Leibniz's concept and, combining it with the observations of [[Willem 's Gravesande]], showed that ''vis viva'' was dependent on the square of the velocities.

Members of the academic establishment such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown. Gradually it came to be suspected that the [[heat]] inevitably generated by motion was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].{{ref|LL}}  [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat. ''Vis viva'' now started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Bernoulli-vis-viva-with-0.5-multiplier-1736 (1741).gif|thumb|An excerpt from [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s article, published in 1741,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernoulli D.|title=De legibus quibusdam mechanicis…|journal=Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae|year=1741|volume=8|pages=99–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the definition of vis viva with 1/2 multiplier.]]
The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to include the coefficient of a half, namely:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was largely the result of the work of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839, although the present-day definition can occasionally be found earlier (e.g., in [[Daniel Bernoulli]] texts).

The former called it the ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work) and both championed its use in engineering calculation.
