The '''agricultural machinery industry''' or '''agricultural engineering industry''' is the part of the [[industry]], that produces and maintain [[tractor]]s, [[agricultural machinery]] and agricultural implements. This branch is considered to be part of the [[machinery industry]].

== History ==
:''See also history of [[Agricultural machinery#History|Agricultural machinery]] and [[Mechanised agriculture#History|Mechanised agriculture]]''

=== 19th century ===
The agricultural machinery industry emerged in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Until then the common tools of farming were the [[plough]] and the sickle.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"&gt;R.C. Gifford. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6JkSfrmbF8C&amp;pg=PA7 Agricultural Engineering in Development: Concepts and principles].'' 1992. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; These iron agricultural implements were often made by [[blacksmiths]] in the local village, who regularly also acted as [[farrier]]. In the first part of the 19th century some of the early agricultural machine manufacturers arose from these blacksmith workshops,&lt;ref name="JHM94"&gt;Jan H. Maas (1994) ''De Nederlandse agrosector: geografie en dynamiek'' p.177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9) even stated that "nearly all farm machinery manufacturers today can be trace their beginnings to a blacksmith."&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[John Deere]] who started up with the production of ploughs in series in the 1840s. 
[[File:Great Exhibition, Agricutlural Implements 2, HF Talbot, 1851.jpg|thumb|Agricultural Implements, 1851.]]
Other companies arose from the introduction of horse drawn [[reaper|reaping]], which replaced the type of [[Scythe|hand reaper]] in use since biblical times.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; A company as the [[International Harvester|McCormick]] started up with building these kind of harvesting machines around the 1840s. And another origin of agricultural industry was the introduction of combined harvesting, threshing and cleaning in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The [[Case Corporation]] for example started building those in 1842 as the Racine Threshing Machine Works. Until early 20th century most of those machinery were powered by horses.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt;

Mid 19th century the portable steam-powered [[ploughing engine|plowing engine]]s were introduced. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. These [[portable engine]]s were also used to power threshing machines, mills and pumps.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The portable steam engines were produced by specific agricultural machinery maker, such as [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies]] who had started as brass and iron-founder making casting ploughshares late 18th century.

Late 19th century in Britain more companies such as [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]] and [[Mann’s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company]] developed [[steam tractor]]s for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html|title=Tractors in the 1930s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins (1987) recalled that the impact of the agricultural machinery industry in the 19th century was still limited. He stated : "prior the third quarter of the nineteenth century the impact of machinery in agriculture was slight compared with that in manufacturing industry. Some operations such as barn work and hay and corn harvesting had been largely mechanized by 1880 but, up to the Second World War, many were still performed by hand labour and large numbers of workers were still required for seasonal tasks such as hop- and fruit-picking and vegetable cultivations."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Edward JT. "[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/35n1a4.pdf The rationality of'surplus' agricultural labour: mechanization in English agriculture in the nineteenth century]." The Agricultural History Review (1987): 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In the beginning of the 20th century in the UK the Agricultural machinery industry "although composed of many hundreds of firms, was dominated by a few large ones, chiefly in the eastern counties of England. The total output of the industry was estimated to be worth 6.5 million pounds in 1913, or about 5 percent of the total value of the output of the mechanical engineering industry at the first Census of Production in 1907."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Peter. "The British Agricultural Machinery Industry, 1914-1939: Boom, Crisis, and Response." ''Agricultural History'' (1995): 298-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006016 027 IFA-Traktor mit Anbauwechselpflug.jpg|thumb|Agricultural exhibitions, 1951]]
In the first decennia the [[internal combustion engine]]; first the [[petrol engine]], and later [[diesel engine]]s; became the main source of [[power (physics)|power]] for the next generation of tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as [[John Deere]] which bought the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] in 1918, which manufactured the popular [[Waterloo Boy]] tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or [[combine harvester]] (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.

In the second part of the 20th century the production of agricultural machinery in development countries rose rapidly. In the 1960s a country as the UK exported more than 60% of its production to Western Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa, and main manufacturers started production plants abroad. Another trend was the increased concentration among manufacturers. In the 1970s in the UK six companies supplied 75% of the total output.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Cowling, David Metcalf, A. J. Rayner. (1973) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKjYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Resource Structure of Agriculture: An Economic Analysis],'' p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: World bank (1954) ''[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1954/06/1554374/western-europe-tractor-agricultural-machinery-industry Western Europe - Tractor and agricultural machinery industry].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The further mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century made possible by the agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land "was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology."&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Production Yearbook 1990.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
A 2013 report by the [[VDMA]] gave the following preview of the current developments in the agricultural machinery industry:
:"''The general trends in society, agriculture and technology allow conclusions about the future requirements profile for agricultural machinery... The depicted dominating topics for the agricultural sector are
:* ''Precision &amp; automation''
:* ''Efficiency &amp; user friendliness''
:* ''Communication &amp; networking''
:''These topics are today already central components of the specifications for new developments...''"&lt;ref&gt;[[VDMA]].  ''[http://www.vdma.org/documents/105903/842491/VDMA%20Market%20Perspectives%202014.pdf/9a9a7bef-4bb5-4d11-891e-934998177005 Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' 2013-14. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural machinery ==
{{Main|Agricultural machinery|List of agricultural machinery}}
The agricultural machinery industry produces [[agricultural machinery]], machinery used in the operation of agricultural areas and farms. Main types are:&lt;ref name="AA 2012"&gt;Ade Asefeso (2012). ''CEO Guide to Doing Business in Australia,'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tractor]]s and power.
* Machinery for  [[tillage]] or soil cultivation.
* Machinery for [[planting]], [[sowing|seeding]], [[fertilizing]], [[pest control]], [[irrigation]].
* Machinery for [[harvesting]], [[haymaking]], and post-harvest, such as produce sorters, and machinery for loading
* Machinery for milking
* Other agricultural machinery, for example grinder mixers, wool presses and [[windmill]]s.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;
In developed countries overall the largest segment of agricultural equipment sales is tractors.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;

== Agricultural machinery manufacturers ==
Agricultural machinery manufacturers exist in sizes from small and medium business to multinationals. James &amp; Akrasanee (1988) stipulated that those forms have different production management, and can be classified into three groups:
:* ''The first group consists of those workshops with limited and simple equipment. Despite their flexibility, the production management system is very rare in this case.''
:* ''The second group includes those with certain degrees of division of labour within the plant. They do organize some plant layout, but not in a fully systematic manner.''
:* ''The last group constitutes those with clear production lines and division of labour.''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth James, Narongchai Akrasanee. ''Small and Medium Business Improvement in the ASEAN Region: Production Management.'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1 dec. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest agricultural machinery manufacturers worldwide based on revenue (in 2012):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/257347/leading-machinery-manufacturers-worldwide/ The leading machinery manufacturers worldwide in 2012, based on revenue]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[John Deere]] : $37.79 billion revenues and employing 67,000 people worldwide in 2013. Its workforce has increased significantly in the past decennia from 43.000 in 2002 to 67.000 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/278010/john-deere-number-of-employees-since-2002/ Number of employees of John Deere (Deere &amp; Company) from 2002 to 2013]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CNH Global]] : $19.4 billion revenues and employing 33.800 people worldwide in 2013.

In the United States the revenue of tractor &amp; agricultural machinery manufacturing sector increased from about 35 billion U.S. dollars in 2009 to 42 billion U.S. dollars in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/291882/revenue-of-tractor-and-agricultural-machinery-manufacturing-in-the-us/ Revenue of tractor &amp; agricultural machinery manufacturing (NAICS 33311) in the United States from 2009 to 2014 (in billion U.S. dollars)]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural machinery associations ==
Some of the more important agricultural machinery associations are:

* Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA): British trade association which represents manufacturers and importers of agricultural machinery and outdoor equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aea.uk.com/about-the-aea About the AEA. Accessed 27.11.2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agrievolution: global network of agricultural machinery associations. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrievolution.com/ Agrevolution website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063122/http://www.agrievolution.com/ |date=August 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM): American association which represents manufacturers of agricultural machinery. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aem.org/ AEM website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* CEMA: European association representing the agricultural machinery industry in Europe. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cema-agri.org/ CEMA website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* VDMA Agricultural Machinery Association: German manufacturers' association which represents manufacturers of agricultural machinery. &lt;ref&gt;[http://lt.vdma.org/en/home VDMA website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ANSEMAT Association of agricultural machinery manufacturers in Spain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansemat.org/ ANSEMAT website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global agricultural machinery industry ==
According to the [[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]], the European association representing the European agricultural machinery industry, Europe was the largest producer of agricultural machinery globally in 2013:&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"&gt;[[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]].

* Europe produced 31% of the global production
* North America produced 26.5% of the global production, 
* China produced 26.5% of the global production, and
* The remaining 16% is produced elsewhere. 
In total, the production of agricultural machinery worldwide in 2013 generated about 95 billion euros,&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"/&gt; based on a report ''Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014''&lt;ref&gt;VDMA.

Yuan'en (2007) stated, that the "Chinese government has attached great importance to agriculture, rural areas and farmers, made a series of policies that favorite to the farmers, added the financial subsidy to the agriculture, especially constituted the subsidy policies for the farmers on their agricultural machinery purchasing."&lt;ref&gt;Yuan’en, Gao, and Machinery Manufacturers. "Agricultural Machinery Industry in China." ''Chinese Association of Manufacturers of Agricultural Machinery'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013-2014 report acknowledged that "China's agricultural machinery industry has achieved rapid development, the gross output value of agricultural machinery exceeded RMB 300 billion, total power of agricultural machinery surpassed 1 billion kilowatts, and the integrated mechanization level of agricultural crops exceeded 50%, demonstrating that China has entered into a mechanized production-oriented period.... Tractors and harvesting machinery are the most important agricultural machinery products in China, with annual output of 2.25 million units and 1.114 million units in 2012 separately...'' &lt;ref&gt;Global and Chinese Agricultural Machinery Industry Report, 2013-2014,'' December 2013.

Gyanendra (2006) recalled, that "the early agricultural mechanization in [[India]] was greatly influenced by the technological development in England. Irrigation pumps, tillage equipment, chaff cutters, tractors and threshers were gradually introduced for farm mechanization. The high yielding varieties with assured irrigation and higher rate of application of fertilizers gave higher returns that enabled farmers to adopt mechanization inputs, especially after Green revolution in 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Gyanendra.

The Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011) explained that "Turkey is one of the few countries of the world which is self-sufficient in food. At present Turkey is the largest producer and exporter of agricultural products in the Near East and North Africa... The agricultural machinery industry is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} about 1000 manufacturers countrywide....

=== Agricultural machinery industry in Europe ===
With a volume of 28 billion euros (2014) agricultural machinery production in the European Union (EU) represented 28 per cent of world total according to VDMA. Out of the EU total, the share of Germany is 27 per cent, followed by Italy (17 per cent) and France (14 per cent). All leading international manufacturers have several production sites on the European continent, and their products from these factories in general are destined for the high end customers who yield for efficiency and accuracy on the fields. 

The EU production of tractors was 187,000 units, correspondent to a value of 9.4 billion euros (2014). Outside the EU, a major production site for tractors is the Minsk Tractor Works (Belarus) with a high market share in the neighbouring countries, especially within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The leading countries for tractor production in the EU are Germany and Italy (with John Deere, Case New Holland, AGCO and Same Deutz-Fahr being the major brands). Germany is also the major place for the manufacturing of harvesting, spraying, fertilizing and seeding equipment. Italy and France have a primary position for soil working machines and transportation vehicles. The majority of the agricultural machinery companies are small and medium-sized and family owned. 

One third of the EU production is destined to markets outside the union, mainly to the Eastern European markets, but also to North America and, increasingly, to Asia.  

After a peak in 2003 and 29 billion euros of turnover, the sector experienced an economic downturn in 2014/2015. The strategy of the European industry is to keep its leading technological position and to diversify its market presence into the high potential regions (e.g. Asia).                 

=== Agricultural machinery industry in North America ===
The AEM (2014) stated that "U.S. domestic sales of agricultural machinery and equipment rose from about $20 billion in 1999 to $38 billion in 2012. Since 1998 and through 2012, U.S. exports of agricultural equipment have grown relatively quickly, more than doubling from about $4 billion to $8.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;AEM (2014) ''[http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf The Economic Footprint of the Agricultural Equipment Industry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205044016/http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf |date=December 5, 2014 }}.'' Whitepaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural machinery industry in South America ===
Graciela summarized (2008) that "the agricultural machinery industry in [[Argentina]] depends for growth on higher exports and further progress towards internationalization, which are strategic goals for the largest firms. Given the dynamism of global demand for this type of machinery, the conclusion is that the sector can increase its sales in export markets, where some of its products are competing well."&lt;ref&gt;García, Graciela.

'''Aurora Fashions''' was a [[holding company]] of several retail fashion brands, formed in 2009 to purchase a number of businesses from the collapsed [[Mosaic Fashions]]. The company operates over 1250 stores in 38 countries, including franchises, under the Oasis, Warehouse and [[Coast (clothing)|Coast]] brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Tiffany|title=Aurora Fashions to be broken up in radical restructure|url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/fashion/aurora-fashions-to-be-broken-up-in-radical-restructure/5047015.article|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=Retail Week|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Business History Review''''' is a scholarly quarterly published by [[Cambridge University Press]] for [[Harvard Business School]]. ''Business History Review'' is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the field of business history. It was established in 1954 by Harvard University Press as the continuation of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JSTOR: All Volumes and Issues - Browse - The Business History Review|url = https://www.jstor.org/journal/busihistrevi|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is one of the leading scholarly journals in the field of [[business history]] alongside ''[[Enterprise &amp; Society]]'' and ''[[Business History (journal)|Business History]]''.

The ''Business History Review'' traces it origins to 1926 with the publication of Harvard’s ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''. The Bulletin aimed “to encourage and aid the study of the evolution of business in all periods and in all countries” and devoted much space to describing the growing archival collections of [http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/ Harvard’s Baker Library]. Henrietta Larson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Henrietta M. Larson Is Dead; Former Professor at Harvard|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/obituaries/henrietta-m-larson-is-dead-former-professor-at-harvard.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1983-09-01|access-date = 2015-08-12|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''Guide to Business History'' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guide to Business History — Henrietta M.

In 1954, the ''Bulletin'' changed its name to ''Business History Review'' and took its current format of publishing peer-reviewed research articles and book reviews.  In these years, the intellectual framework of the field of business history was defined by the work of [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], who published 11 research articles in the journal.  One of the most popular (with 212 Google Scholar cites) was his 1959 piece “The Beginnings of ‘Big Business’ in American Industry,” which explored the question of why large, vertically integrated [[corporations]] were formed in the late nineteenth-century and why they took the structure they did. Another highly cited article (240 Google Scholar cites) from 1970 was “The Emerging Organizational Synthesis in American History” by Louis Galambos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Louis Galambos {{!}} Department of History {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|url = http://history.jhu.edu/directory/louis-galambos/|website = history.jhu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also focused on explaining the growth of bureaucratic structures in the United States.

In 1974, ''Business History Review'' published its first special issue on the [[multinational corporation]].  Included in the issue was an article on oil companies operating in South America by Mira Wilkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mira Wilkins|url = http://economics.fiu.edu/people/emeritus-faculty/mira-wilkins/|website = Department of Economics|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = John|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered the field of international business history. The journal also expanded its focus beyond the workings of business enterprise to cover business-government relations.  In 1975, [[Thomas K. McCraw]], who edited the journal from 1994 to 2005, published “Regulation in America: A Review Article.” In 2011, the current editors, Walter A. Friedman and [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]] (academic), listed the ''BHR''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s core subjects as innovation, globalization, entrepreneurship, business and the environment, business and government, and business and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Business History: Time for Debate|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0007680511000201|journal = Business History Review|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 2044-768X|pages = 1–8|volume = 85|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0007680511000201|first = Walter A.|last = Friedman|first2 = Geoffrey|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the journal had an impact factor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal Citation Reports - IP &amp; Science - Thomson Reuters|url = http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/analytical/jcr/|website = wokinfo.com|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = Thomson|last = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; of .625 (with a 5-year impact factor of .895) and was rated as a 4 by the British Academic Journal Guide (a 4* is the highest rating).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Academic Journal Guide 2015 - Chartered Association of Business Schools|url = http://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2015/|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
'''Business analytics''' ('''BA''') refers to the skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on [[data]] and [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. In contrast, [[business intelligence]] traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the two sentences|date=October 2017}}

Business [[analytics]] makes extensive use of statistical analysis, including explanatory and [[predictive modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | title=Predictive vs. Explanatory Modeling in IS Research | author=Galit Schmueli and Otto Koppius | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082717/http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | archivedate=2010-10-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fact-based management to drive [[decision making]]. It is therefore closely related to [[management science]]. Analytics may be used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. Business intelligence is [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[report]]ing, [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP), and "alerts."

In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, and alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next (predict), and what is the best outcome that can happen (optimize).&lt;ref name=Davenport2007&gt;{{Cite book

==Examples of application==
Banks, such as [[Capital One]], use [[data analysis]] (or ''[[analytics]]'', as it is also called in the business setting), to differentiate among customers based on [[credit risk]], usage and other characteristics and then to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. [[Harrah's Entertainment|Harrah’s]], the gaming firm, uses analytics in its [[customer loyalty]] programs. [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]] quantitatively analyses and predicts the appeal of its wines.

&lt;!-- Need to expand descriptions in this section --&gt;
* Decision Analytics: supports human decisions with visual analytics that the user models to reflect reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analytics List|url=http://www.rhbs.me/about-rh/|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Analytics have been used in business since the management exercises were put into place by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in the late 19th century. [[Henry Ford]] measured the time of each component in his newly established assembly line. But analytics began to command more attention in the late 1960s when computers were used in [[decision support systems]]. Since then, analytics have changed and formed with the development of [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, [[data warehouses]], and a large number of other software tools and processes.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

In later years the business analytics have exploded with the introduction to computers. This change has brought analytics to a whole new level and has brought about endless possibilities. As far as analytics has come in history, and what the current field of analytics is today, many people would never think that analytics started in the early 1900s with Mr. Ford himself.

==Challenges==
Business analytics depends on sufficient volumes of high quality data. The difficulty in ensuring data quality is integrating and reconciling data across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of [[forecasting]] [[consumer behavior]] by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |title= Choosing the Best Storage for Business Analytics |publisher= Dell.com |accessdate= 2012-06-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120718204914/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |archivedate= 2012-07-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time.

==Competing on analytics==
[[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics:&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;
* One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics
* Widespread use of not only [[descriptive statistics]], but also predictive modeling and complex [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques
* Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes
* Movement toward an enterprise level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities

A '''business college''' is a school that provides education above the high school level but could not be compared to that of a traditional [[university]] or [[college]].  Unlike universities and even [[Junior college|junior]] and [[community college]]s, business colleges typically train the student for a specific [[vocational]] aspect, usually [[clerk|clerical]] tasks such as [[typing]], [[stenography]] or simple [[bookkeeping]].

The goal of a business college is not to provide a thorough education, as is the model of modern universities in the [[Liberal Arts|liberal arts]] fields, but rather to provide training for a very specific task.  Traditionally, credits earned at a business college do not transfer to other colleges or universities and students cannot earn a [[bachelor's degree]], though an [[associate degree]] may be offered.

In recent decades the number of these institutions has been declining as business colleges have been finding more competition coming from community colleges, which provide both vocational as well as liberal arts classes and are often able to offer the classes at a lower rate of tuition, as they are usually nonprofit and subsidized by one or more levels of government.  Business colleges should not be confused with [[business school]]s which typically offer a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program after a student has completed a bachelor's degree.

In the US, business colleges are sometimes also called [[proprietary colleges]], especially when they grant [[associate degree]]s or higher.

A '''business directory''' is a website or [[print media|printed]] listing of [[information]] which lists businesses within niche based categories. Businesses can be categorized by niche, location, activity, or size. Business may be compiled either manually or through an automated online search software. Online [[yellow pages]] are a type of business directory, as is the traditional [[phone book]].

The details provided in a business directory may vary. They may include the business name, addresses, telephone numbers, location, contact information, type of service or products the business provides, the number of employees, the served region and any [[professional association]]s. Some directories include a section for user reviews, comments, and feedback. Business directories in the past would take a printed format but have recently been upgraded to websites due to the advent of the internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Many business directories offer complimentary listings in addition to the premium options. There are many business directories and some of these have moved over to the [[internet]] and away from printed format. Whilst not being [[search engine]]s, business directories often have a search function, enabling users to search businesses by [[Zip Code]], country, state, area or city.

== Formats ==
Business directories can be in either [[hard copy]] or in [[Digital formats|digital format]]. Ease of use and distribution means that many trade directories have a digital version.

A '''business executive''' is a person responsible for running an organization, although the exact nature of the role varies depending on the organization.

Executives run [[companies]] or [[government agencies]]. They create plans to help their organizations grow.

==Occupations==
The business executive occupation covers many jobs. These positions include [[chief executive officer]], department store manager, and [[small business]] operator. Executives are in charge of their organization. They create and review goals for the company. They work closely with a team of upper-level staff or assistants. This team may make both long- and short-range plans to achieve these goals. Once the plans are set, executives make sure the company follows the changes. They do this by meeting with the managers of all the departments and getting progress reports. Executives are typically elected by the organization's owners, [[shareholder]]s, [[board of director]]s. The term usually refers to the person running the organization or someone involved in the upper-level management role of a corporation, company, as opposed to being the founder, owner, or majority shareholder of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maryellen-tribby/entrepreneur-vs-ceo-under_b_3691542.html | title=Entrepreneur vs. CEO: Understanding the Difference Can Save Your Business | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/entrepreneur-vs-executive-34605.html | title=Entrepreneur Vs. Executive | publisher=Globalpost | accessdate=25 August 2014 | author=Sam Ashe-Edmunds,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
Executives' duties depend on how many people are on their staff. Some executives oversee general managers in different areas. In larger organizations, they may direct one area, such as [[marketing]], finance, or legal services. For example, in the financial area, executives may direct the buying or selling of land or other investments. Other executives get more involved. They may hire and train new staff. They may direct staff in what tasks need to be done. They may choose computer systems to record data, such as budgets. When complaints arise, executives may direct investigations to resolve what occurred in the agency or between staff members.

A large part of an executive's job is developing relationships with people outside the organization. These people may be customers or contributors. One way executives create relationships is by giving speeches at [[Business conference|conferences]]. Executives may also serve on the boards of community groups. These activities promote the company and its leader.

In addition, executives oversee [[budget]]s. They use budgets to analyze how well the organization is running. They make suggestions about where to cut expenses. Executives may also suggest where improvements could be made. Executives also negotiate contracts with outside agencies. They need good persuasion skills to keep costs down. Some executives write yearly reports to let their communities know what has been accomplished.

==Government executives==
Government executives oversee agencies that develop laws and regulations. They meet regularly with their citizens. They learn how voters feel about the issues. Officials need to do these reality checks to see if they have the citizens' support. Executives also promote economic growth within their communities. They plan and organize different activities to help meet these goals. Government executives make connections between the United States and other countries. They help to promote [[international trade]].

The government executive occupation also covers many jobs. They range from city council member, mayor, and governor, all the way up to President of the United States. Some of these positions are elected. Other officials are appointed to their jobs. In smaller communities, many of these jobs may be volunteer positions. Sometimes these jobs run through only part of the year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

==Description==

Through the combination of an algorithm and a personal check, they "match" the most suitable consultant with the project's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-hundert.com/startups/comatch-the-berlin-consulting-marketplace-startup-2/|title=Comatch - Berlin Consulting Marketplace Startup - the Hundert - Female Startup Founders Europe|website=the Hundert - Female Startup Founders Europe|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the platform is not available for everyone: after the registration, an assessment based on the CV and personal interviews takes place. In the end, only 50% are passing the quality assessment and will be accepted. Most of the registered consultants worked for the big top tier consultancies like [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]] or [[Roland Berger (company)|Roland Berger]]. 

The registration and requesting projects are free for consultants and clients, a cost of 15% of the daily rate only occur after successful matching for the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/berufsleben/unternehmensberater-wie-freiberufliche-consultants-arbeiten-a-1077159.html|title=Freiberufliche Consultants: Jetzt mach ich die Überstunden für mich|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

COMATCH GmbH was founded in October 2014 by the former [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] consultants Dr. Christoph Hardt and Dr. Jan Schächtele with the support of Venture Capital Company Atlantic Labs (Christophe Maire).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12139">'''Cabotage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|b|ə|t|ᵻ|dʒ|,_|-|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is the [[transport]] of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to [[aviation]], [[railways]], and [[road transport]] as well.

'''Cabotage rights''' are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic [[protectionism]], [[national security]], or [[public safety]]. One notable exception is the [[European Union]], whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |title="European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" EU Commission White paper |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927035247/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Cabotage originally meant simply [[Short sea shipping|coasting trade]], from the French ''caboter'', to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25785 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In shipping==
Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adherence to the cabotage system|url=http://www.naiko-kaiun.or.jp/e/union/union10.html|publisher=Japan Federation of Coastal Shipping Associations|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the history of cabotage in UK law, see [[Navigation Acts]].

In the United States, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.

[[Indonesia]] implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabotage provides a big  boost to shipping industry |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/23/cabotage-provides-a-big-boost-shipping-industry.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=The Jakarta Post|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts [[coastwise trade]] or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the [[Maritime Industry Authority]]. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Republic Act No. 10668: Policy Considerations to Improve Coastwise Trade|url=http://industry.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Beyond-Republic-Act-No-10668-Policy-Considerations-to-Improve-Coastwise-Trade.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=Sector Planning Bureau of the Department of Trade and Industry|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/exceptions-from-eu-free-movement-law-9781849466202/ EU derogations]&lt;/ref&gt; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html Paros ferry disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbfGMxu6?url=http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html |date=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hague–Visby Rules]], a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to "carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby rules, Article X&lt;/ref&gt; However, section 1(3) of the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] declares that the Rules "shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...".

==In passenger aviation==
Cabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]] prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations.&lt;ref name="havel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Havel|first1=Brian F.|title=The Principles and Practice of International Aviation Law|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020528|pages=50–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8H2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=ShuKdGSAP2&amp;dq=chile%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabotage is not granted under most [[open skies]] agreements.

===European Union===
Carriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations.&lt;ref name="havel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/haulage/cabotage_en "Cabotage"] European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryanair]], [[easyJet]], [[Vueling]], [[Wizz Air]], and [[Aer Lingus]] have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from [[New Zealand]] and vice versa. An Australian carrier, [[Jetstar]] (a [[Qantas]] subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. [[Air New Zealand]] offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between [[Sydney]], Australia and [[Rarotonga]] of the [[Cook Islands]]. Previously, [[Jetconnect|Qantas Jetconnect]],  [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] (a [[Virgin Australia]] subsidiary) and [[Ansett New Zealand]] were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.

Australia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as [[Tiger Airways Australia]] and the domestic arm of [[Virgin Australia]]) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

===Chile===
[[Chile]] has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier [[LATAM Chile]], which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt; Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0406:EN:NOT |title=Communication from the Commission – Strengthening aviation relations with Chile |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===

Before 1991, [[Lufthansa]] was prohibited from flying to [[West Berlin]], so [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Airways]], and [[Air France]] operated the routes between [[West Germany]] and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, [[Trans World Airlines]] also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan&amp;nbsp;Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from [[Munich-Riem Airport]] (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from [[Düsseldorf]]. British Airways flew from [[Münster]]-[[Osnabrück]], [[Hannover]], and some other cities.

In 2003&amp;ndash;2004, the [[United States Department of Transportation]] authorized [[Polynesian Airlines]] to provide temporary cabotage service in [[American Samoa]] after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabotage definition and standards for emergency exemption|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/igia/2011/upload/20-AviationCabotageDOT.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October&amp;nbsp;2007, the [[United Kingdom]] granted [[Singapore]] carriers the right to fly domestic UK&amp;nbsp;routes as part of an [[open skies]] agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/303608/1/.html |title=Channelnewsasia.com |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

==Related concepts==

==="Modified sixth freedom"===

The "modified [[freedoms of the air|sixth freedom]]" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasigh|first1=Bijan|title=Introduction to Air Transport Economics: From Theory to Applications|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzPekWiS9I0C&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;ots=Abr6R5Ihxl&amp;dq=qantas%20new%20york%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Canada's new government delivers greater Air Travel choice through Open Skies agreement with the United States|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|date=12 March 2007|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=283149|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the United States fined [[Asiana Airlines]] for selling tickets from the mainland US to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] via Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Compart|first1=Andrew|title=DOT fines Asiana for violating cabotage laws|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/DOT-fines-Asiana-for-violating-cabotage-laws/|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Travel Weekly|date=31 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tag rights===

Certain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, [[Qantas]] operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.

'''Canned responses''' are predetermined responses to common questions.

In fields such as [[technical support]], canned responses to [[frequently asked question]]s may be quick and convenient for both the customer and the technical adviser. In text-based technical support systems, the [[operator (profession)|operator]] may insert a canned response triggered by keystrokes or from a drop-down menu, rather than typing the same answer repeatedly or pasting from some other resource. For example, if a support representative at an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s technical support team is asked to explain how to add an [[email attachment|attachment to an email]], rather than typing in all the details, the support representative may choose the response from a drop down menu, and it gets inserted into the response. The representative is more productive this way, and the user receives a more carefully crafted answer. Some programs have built-in functions which allow canned responses, and other software is available which can insert canned responses into any other application.

Canned responses, however, can have disadvantages. Sloppy or pressured support people could end up using canned responses as a quick fix when they actually do not really resolve the customer's problem or are only tangentially relevant to the user's problem.

'''Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Agència per a la Competitivitat de l'Empresa, ACCIÓ'') is the [[Catalan Government]]’s agency that promotes foreign investment and business competitiveness. Headquartered in [[Barcelona]], it currently operates globally through a network of 40 offices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalonia.com/about_us.jsp Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment - WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission== 
Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment’s mission is to promote innovation, internationalisation, trade and funding of Catalan companies and startups. It also provides support, insight and advice to international companies interested in investing in [[Catalonia]] and Barcelona.&lt;ref name="estatutos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Departament d'Empresa i Ocupació&lt;/small&gt;|trans-title=Department of Business and Employment|year=2015|url=http://portaldogc.gencat.cat/utilsEADOP/PDF/6976/1449764.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2008 as a result of merging the public office Commercial Promotion Consortium of Catalonia (Catalan: Consorci de Promoció Comercial de Catalunya, COPCA) and the Innovation and Business Development Center (Catalan: Centre d'Innovació i Desenvolupament Empresarial, CIDEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duran |first1=Manuel |title=Mediterranean Paradiplomacies: The Dynamics of Diplomatic Reterritorialization |date=2015 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |isbn=978-90-04-28540-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first foreign office of COPCA and CIDEM was established in [[Tokyo]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Japan Action Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Action Plan of the Government of Catalonia 2016-2019|year=2016|url=http://exteriors.gencat.cat/web/.content/saeue/afers_exteriors_cooperacio/04_arees_actuacio/Pla_Catalunya_Japo/Pla-Japo_2016-2019_angles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period the first American office in [[New York City|New York]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=García |first1=Caterina |title=Democratic Spain: Reshaping External Relations in a Changing World |date=1995 |publisher=Richard Gillespie, Fernando Rodrigo, Jonathan Story |location=London, UK |isbn=978-0-415-11325-0 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 two offices were opened in [[Europe]] ([[London]] and [[Paris]]) and one in North Africa ([[Casablanca]]).

The '''Charles Egan Gallery''' opened at 63 East 57th Street ([[Manhattan]]) in about 1945, when Charles Egan was in his mid-30s. Egan's artists helped him fix up the gallery: "[[Isamu Noguchi]] did the lighting... [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]] painted the walls."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stevens, Annalyn Swan, [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54817142 "De Kooning : an American master,"] (New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group show the next year included works by [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]], [[Joseph Stella]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Georges Braque]]. 

== Timeline ==
In 1948, Charles Egan Gallery held a solo exhibition of de Kooning's black and white paintings. [[Irving Sandler]] wrote that because of this exhibition, "de Kooning was established as a major [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] ... soon to be the most influential artist of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1949 [[Joseph Cornell]] had his first show at the Charles Egan Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159592539{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]] had his first show at the Egan Gallery, where he continued to show until 1955.

In 1952 [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]] had his first show at the Egan Gallery, and subsequent solo shows in 1953 and 1954, and where he continued to show until the mid-1950s. 

In 1954 [[Knox Martin]] had his first one-man show at the Charles Egan Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/09/16/archives/about-art-and-artists-knox-martin-impresses-in-first-oneman-show.html | work=The New York Times | title=About Art and Artists; Knox Martin Impresses in First One-Man Show  | date=September 16, 1954 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14053">A '''chief human resources officer''' ('''CHRO''') is a corporate officer who oversees all aspects of [[human resource management]] and [[industrial relations]] policies, practices and operations for an organization. Similar job titles include: ''chief people officer'', ''chief personnel officer'', ''executive vice president of human resources'' and ''senior vice president of human resources''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maura|first=Ciccarelli|title=Trust at the Top|url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=533342772|publisher=Human Resource Executive Online|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/about/board-of-directors|title=HR Policy Association Board of Directors Roster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles and responsibilities of a typical CHRO can be categorized as follows: workforce strategist, organizational and performance conductor, HR service delivery owner, [[corporate governance|compliance and governance]] regulator, and coach and adviser to the senior leadership team and the board of directors. CHROs may also be involved in board member selection and orientation, [[executive compensation]], and [[succession planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 21st Century Chief Human Resource Officer |url=http://www.hrmguide.com/general/chro.htm |date=2006-04-04 |work= |publisher=''[[Deloitte]]'' |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magdata.lrp.com/MAGDATA/servlet/DataServlet?fname=07012008Extra_CHROChallengesAndStrategies.pdf|title=The Chief Human Resources Officer: Key Challenges &amp; Strategies for Success|last=|first=|date=2008-06-27|work=|publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|Cornell University Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, functions such as communications, facilities, public relations and related areas may fall within the scope of the CHRO role. Increasingly, CHROs report directly to chief executive officers and are members of the most senior-level committees of a company (e.g., executive committee or office of the CEO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/documents/ces_research/changing_chro_role_2016.pdf|title=The Changing Chief Human Resources Officer Role|last=Wright|first=Patrick|date=|website=|publisher=University of South Carolina Darla Moore School of Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of the profession ==

The role of the CHRO has evolved rapidly to meet the human capital needs of organizations operating across multiple regulatory and labor environments.  Whereas CHROs once focused on organizations human resources in just one or two countries, today many oversee complex networks of employees on more than one continent and implement workforce development strategies on a global scale.  CHROs are especially important now in helping companies navigate the workforce issues associated with expanding into emerging markets, and in developing labor policies to suit different regions of the world while preserving a company’s core culture.

The strategic role of the CHRO has also expanded as workforces are increasingly composed of knowledge workers, and companies require better systems to compete for scarce high-skilled workers.  Rather than focusing exclusively on human resource issues and service delivery, CHROs must concentrate on creating strong talent pipelines to both enhance organizational decision-making and secure future growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boudreau|first=John W.|title=Beyond HR: The New Science of Human Capital|year=2007|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|author2=Peter M. Ramstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These changes in the business landscape have required the CHRO to heighten the focus on talent, capabilities and company culture.

== Responsibilities ==

According to an annual survey conducted by the largest industry group for CHROs, the HR Policy Association in the United States, top CHRO concerns over the years fall roughly into three broad categories: talent, capabilities, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/downloads/2017/2011-03-02%20CHRO%20Report%20FINAL%20(no%20cover%20page).pdf|title=Principal Chief Human Resource Officer Concerns|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talent ===
Talent management includes building the quality and depth of talent, including a focus on succession and leadership/employee development.  In a separate survey of over 200 U.S. and European CHROs, University of South Carolina professor Patrick Wright&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moore.sc.edu/facultyresearch/faculty.aspx?faculty_id=200]&lt;/ref&gt; found that nearly all participants cited 'talent' as the top priority on their CEO's agenda for HR.&lt;ref&gt;cipositions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hueslid|first=Mark |author2=Richard Beatty |author3=Brian Becker|title=The Strategic Logic of Workforce Management|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=December 2005|pages=110–117|url=http://www.markhuselid.com/pdfs/articles/2005%20Huselid-Beatty-Becker%20HBR%20Paper.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capabilities ===
Managing corporate capabilities includes dealing with rapid changes in technology,  globalization, and the increasingly complex  external context of government regulations and public policy (impacting union and employee relations, executive compensation, health care, retirement programs, health and safety, etc.).

The key capabilities required are expected to vary by company based on business strategy and the competitive global environment.  Adapting to new technologies and sources of information and communications are essential to success for all companies.  Other capabilities the HR function must help the company develop include: managing the external context, managing a multi-generational workforce, adapting to change, and operating effectively in different cultures and business structures.

=== Culture ===
Cultural issues include organizational change, agility, social networking, ethics and values, innovation, customer focus, [[employee engagement]], diversity and inclusiveness, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/downloads/2017/2011-03-02%20CHRO%20Report%20FINAL%20(no%20cover%20page).pdf|title=Principal Chief Human Resource Officer Concerns 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human resources function has a leadership role in helping shape the culture of the company.  Ensuring that the values of the company are communicated and understood at all levels, providing clarity as to the expected behavior of all employees and the development of a high performance culture are important aspects of the CHRO role.  When an employee’s behavior is inconsistent with the values of the company, the human resources function is responsible for ensuring that such situations are dealt with fairly.  The HR function also helps the organization establish and maintain high levels of employee engagement and commitment.

Increasingly, companies are relying on external partners, joint-ventures, as well as merged and acquired companies as sources of innovation, capabilities and growth.  Establishing a culture that is supportive of such external partnerships is an area where the HR function plays an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/f5Ks|title=Functional Responsibilities of the CHRO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing the findings of a recent study of HR leaders, Randy MacDonald, former CHRO for IBM, indicated that the three key workforce gaps CHROs cite as the biggest opportunities for HR are: 
* Cultivating creative leaders who can more nimbly lead in complex, global environments
* Mobilizing for greater speed and flexibility producing significantly greater capability to adjust underlying costs and faster ways to allocate talent 
* Capitalizing on collective intelligence through much more effective collaboration across increasingly global teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/chro/study/|title=Working Beyond Borders: Insights from the Global Chief Human Resource Officer Study|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IBM Corp.|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path to becoming a CHRO ==

The CHRO is the top HR position, but those who attain this role arrive there by working in a variety of functions both within the HR function and other functional and leadership roles both inside their company and across industries and employers.  In a 2011 survey of top HR leaders, roughly two-thirds of CHROs indicated they worked outside HR at some time in their career.  There is also significant movement between companies with only 36% of US CHROs gaining their position through internal promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/commentary/blog/the-sorry-state-of-chro-succession-9393|title=The Sorry State of CHRO Succession|last=Wright|first=Patrick|date=|work=View From the Top|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of HR experience, one survey indicated that the most common area of functional experience for CHROs is talent management; the next most common experience is [[compensation and benefits]], followed by organizational culture.  Current CHROs have had broader functional experience in HR than their predecessors and are less likely to have had experience in labor relations than past CHROs.

== Job description ==

Two recently published books about the CHRO profession, ''The Talent Masters: Why Smart Leaders Put People Before Numbers'', by Bill Conaty and [[Ram Charan;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Chief Human Resource Officer, Defining the Role of Human Resource Leaders'' by Pat Wright, offer insights into the profession from its leading practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470905344.html|title=The Chief HR Officer: Defining the New Role of Human Resource Leaders|last=Wright|first=Patrick|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perennial top priority for CHROs is talent management.  In ''The Chief Human Resource Officer, Defining the Role of Human Resource Leaders'', Eva Sage-Gavin, former CHRO for the Gap emphasizes this point saying, "... at the end of the day, you and your team are the experts at talent management and must be able to understand and identify good versus great talent… Identifying critical positions, the great attributes needed to fill them, and prioritizing recruiting strategies accordingly was the key to success, whether I was working with engineers, apparel designers, or international operations management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470905344.html|title=The Chief HR Officer|last=Wright|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Kevin Cox, CHRO for American Express, argues that "Great CHROs (and great CEOs) understand that talent needs to be developed in thoughtful, but not incremental, ways.  Getting the balance right between ‘stretch’ and ‘in over her head’ isn’t easy, but it is vital to the success of a world-class talent strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|title=The Chief HR Officer|pages=74|asin=0470905344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CHRO helps the company build sustainable competitive advantage through the selection and development of top talent that possess capabilities that help differentiate the company from its competitors.  Conaty and Charan emphasize this point in ''Talent Masters'' by noting that “Only one competency lasts. It is the ability to create a steady, self-renewing stream of leaders. Money is just a commodity. Talent supplies the edge. We can’t put it any better than Ron Nersesian, the head of Agilent Technologies’ Electronic Measurement Group: ‘Developing people’s talent is the whole of the company at the end of the day. Our products all are time- perishable. The only thing that stays is the institutional learning and the development of the skills and the capabilities that we have in our people.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leading CHROs emphasize additional aspects of HR leadership, such as delivering results with a global team – a major challenge identified by Hugh Mitchell, CHRO for Royal Dutch Shell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – and developing and communicating an [[employee value proposition]] that will differentiate the company in its efforts to attract and retain the caliber of talent needed to achieve its business objectives, as emphasized by Michael Davis, former CHRO for General Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clock Software''' is a private limited company developing software and hardware [[solution]]s for the [[hospitality industry]] - property management system, restaurant point of sale, online booking engine, channel manager, self-service kiosk, mobile hotel app. Its headquarters is in London, UK.

== History ==
Clock Software was incorporated in 1994 in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], under the name Clock Ltd (Клок ООД). Initially, the company specialized in selling hardware and peripherals but soon switched its focus to the development of hotel software. In 1996 Clock launched their first property management system - ClockFront for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. At the time, a huge privatisation was going on as part of the transition of the country to [[democracy]] and [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivanov|first1=Stanislav H|last2=Dimitrova|first2=Miroslava|title=Tourism Management and Planning in Bulgaria|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228245420_Tourism_Management_and_Planning_in_Bulgaria|website=Researchgate|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All hotels, previously owned by the state, were changing ownership and needed new software to replace previous, often centralised, management systems. Clock Software took the chance to offer their software to the newly privatised hotels.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Spasov, Spas|title=Еволюция по часовник|trans-title=Clockwork Evolution|url=http://www.capital.bg/biznes/predpriemach/2010/11/26/1000860_evoljuciia_po_chasovnik/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=www.capital.bg|issue=Entrepreneur|date=November 26, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Clock Software started to expand to countries outside Bulgaria and opened offices in Romania (2007) and Croatia (2008). The first markets where their products were adopted were Romania, Macedonia and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution" /&gt;

In 2010 Clock took the decision to create a completely new hospitality software suite based on [[cloud technology]]. The new product was built around the idea of consolidation of separate applications into one cloud-based platform and switching from data-focused to guest-centered software model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Традиционният хотелски софтуер е мъртъв|trans-title=Traditional hotel software is dead|url=http://www.horemag.bg/print.php?storyid=1014935|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=HOtels &amp; REstaurants MAGazine|date=December 21, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cloud Hotel PMS: A paradigm shift from managing rooms to engaging with guests|url=https://www.raconteur.net/business/cloud-hotel-pms-a-paradigm-shift-from-managing-rooms-to-engaging-with-guests|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=Future of Hospitlaity report|publisher=Raconteur Media|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new branch was registered in [[London, UK]] under the name of Clock Software Ltd. to take over the international development and the distribution of the cloud-based software products, while the Bulgarian branch remained in charge of software development and support.

In economics, a '''commodity''' is an economic good or service that has full or substantial [[fungibility]]: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commodities are [[raw material]]s, basic resources, [[agriculture|agricultural]], or [[mining]] products, such as [[iron ore]], [[sugar]], or [[grain|grains]] like [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as [[chemical substance|chemicals]] and [[computer memory]].

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller [[profit margin|profit margins]] and diminishes the importance of factors (such as [[brand|brand name]]) other than price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commodity definition |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commodity |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''commodity'' came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French ''[[:wikt:commodité#French|commodité]]'', "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:commoditas#Latin|commoditas]]'', meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word ''[[:wikt:commodus#Latin|commodus]]'' (from which English gets other words including ''commodious'' and ''accommodate'') meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit".

== Characteristics ==
In economics, the term ''commodity'' is used specifically for economic goods or services that have full or partial but substantial [[fungibility]]; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx described this property as follows: "From the taste of [[wheat]], it is not possible to tell who produced it, a [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serf]], a French peasant or an English [[capitalist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum]] and [[copper]] are examples of commodity goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |author2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in action |publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

Non-commodity items such as [[stereo]] systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the [[brand]], the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets.

== Hard and soft commodities ==
[[Soft commodity|Soft commodities]] are goods that are grown, such as [[wheat]], or [[rice]].

Hard commodities are [[mining|mined]]. Examples include [[gold]], [[helium]], and [[petroleum|oil]].

Energy commodities include electricity, gas, [[coal]] and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is processed.

== Commoditization ==
[[Commoditization]] occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the [[intellectual capital]] necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium [[Profit margin|margins]] for [[Market (economics)|market]] [[wikt:participation|participants]] have become commodities, such as [[Generic drug|generic pharmaceuticals]] and [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM chips]]. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites [[multivitamin]] supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50&amp;nbsp;mg tablet of [[calcium]] is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Natasha Singer |author2=Peter Lattman |title=Workout Supplement Challenged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/business/a-soldiers-parents-take-aim-at-gnc-and-a-supplement-maker.html?hpw&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this trend, [[nanomaterials]] are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.&lt;ref&gt;C. McGovern, ″Commoditization of nanomaterials″. ''Nanotechnology Perceptions'' '''6''' (2010) 155–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of "commodity versus differentiable product". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where [[electricity market#Retail electricity market|energy choice]] lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as "[[Organic food|organic]] versus not" or "[[Free-range eggs|cage free]] versus not" count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or [[Forest Stewardship Council]] [[Certified wood|certification]] count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.

==Commodity trade==
{{Main article|Futures exchange|Commodity market}}
In the original and simplified sense, '''''commodities''''' were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.

[[Commodities exchange]]s include:&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;

== Inventory data ==
The [[inventory]] of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a "[[stockout]]" (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a [[convenience yield]] by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.&lt;ref&gt;Gorton GB et al. (2008).

==Commodification of labor==
{{See also|Labour is not a commodity}}

In classical political economy and especially in [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service ("product" or "activity"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;) produced by [[labour power|human labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 38 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are external to man.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', p. 87 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some objects attain "[[use value]]" to persons in this world, when they are found to be "necessary, useful or pleasant in life,"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politica'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; "Use value" makes an object "an object of human wants,"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; or is "a means of subsistence in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became "commodities." Commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'' p. 36 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 131 and David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: 1971, London) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. [[Adam Smith]] maintained that exchange value was made up of [[economic rent|rent]], [[economic profit|profit]], [[labor economics|labour]] and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]], a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources ("earth itself is an instrument of labour"),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 179 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the [[labour theory of value|labor theory of value]]. This problem was extensively debated by [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books, London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow]] among others.

All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the "price" and the "value" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The "value" of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.

Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the "quantity of labour" to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the "socially necessary labour time"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 39 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the "exchange value" of a given commodity.

Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics, and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists. However, Marx held that the value and price of any commodity would coincide only when demand and supply were equivalent to each other.

{{For|the job position related to building and managing (online) communities|Online community manager}}
A '''community association manager''' is a [[management|manager]] of a [[condominium]] or [[homeowners association]] (including [[single-family detached home|single-family home]] subdivisions, townhouses, or [[mixed-use development]]).  The position is frequently confused with a [[property manager]], who deals with individual rental units or a group of rental units, like an [[Apartment building|apartment complex]]. The community manager deals with property owners and homeowners.

People with this position are also sometimes called '''community managers''', which is distinct from [[online community manager]]s.

==Types==

On-site manager: This type of manager works in the community which he or she manages.

Portfolio manager: This type of community manager oversees several communities and is often paid on a [[commission (remuneration)|commission basis]].

Large-scale manager: Typically, large scale managers are also on-site managers. The [[Community Associations Institute]] offers certification for Large-scale managers and notes the following description: This designation allows a professional holding the PCAM (Professional Community Association Manager) designation to specialize in issues facing larger community associations. To be considered for this designation, the candidate must already be a manager of a large-scale community of over 1200 units, {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} and a budget of at least $1.5m.

==Florida Specific==

The state of Florida requires community association managers to hold a license. Performing duties as a CAM without a license is a violation of Florida Statutes. 

A link to the Department of Professional and Business Regulation, as well as a Frequently Asked Question PDF file, is included in the Reference section below.

==Credentials==
Organizations like the Community Associations Institute offer rigorous courses for professional managers to obtain their certification. The Community Association Managers International Certification Board's (CAMICB) (A different organization) provides internationally accredited certifications. Some common certifications include Certified Manager of Community Associations (CMCA) offered through the CAMICB, Association Management Specialist (AMS), and Professional Community Association Manager (PCAM).  Being able to find a professional management company is an important task for many board members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">'''Contract management software''' is the range of computer programmes, libraries and data used to support [[contract management]], [[contract lifecycle management]], and [[contractor management]] on projects. It may be used with [[project management software]].

==Advantages and key functions==
Most sophisticated projects involving contractors now use contract management software instead of relying on the manual management of paper contracts. It has become an essential tool for keeping track of multiple activities with cost implications, and can be especially helpful for automating administration, ensuring compliance, monitoring risk, running reports and triggering alerts.&lt;ref name="techtarget.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/definition/contract-management-software|title=What is contract management software? - Definition from WhatIs.com|website=SearchFinancialApplications.techtarget.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of features, contract management software systems provide a centralized repository for employees to quickly access all contracts worldwide in one place. Having contracts stored in multiple locations can delay and interrupt the contracting process.

Contract management software is produced by many companies, working on a range of scales and offering varying degrees of customizability. Basic functions should include the ability to store contract documents, track changes to contract documents, search documents for a particular criterion, send key date alerts and to report required aspects of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489199,00.asp|title=The Best Contract Management Software of 2015|website=PCMAG.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other functions include managing a new contract request, capturing related data, following a document through a review and approval process, and collecting [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name="techtarget.com"/&gt;

Contract management software may also be an aid to [[project portfolio management]] and [[spend analysis]], and may also monitor [[Key performance indicator|KPIs]].&lt;ref name="8over8.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.8over8.com/hubfs/WhitePapers/8over8-Whitepaper-Contract-Management-Capital-Expenditure_2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=8over8 : White Paper : Contract management for capital expenditure |website=Info.8over8.com |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading contract management software provides contract visibility, monitoring, and compliance to automate and streamline the [[Contract lifecycle management|contract lifecycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/hubfs/TOFU%20Offer%20-%208%20Critical%20Stages%20of%20Contract%20Management/8%20Critical%20Stages%20of%20Contract%20Management%20-%20CobbleStone%20Software-1.pdf|title=Whitepaper: 8 Critical Stages of Contract Management|last=|first=|date=|website=www.CobbleStoneSoftware.com|publisher=CobbleStone Software|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; process.

A centralized repository provides a critical advantage allowing for all contract documents to be stored and within one location. Having contracts stored in multiple locations can delay and interrupt the contracting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3099169/it-industry/how-to-stop-making-costly-it-contract-mistakes.html|title=How to stop  making costly IT contract mistakes|first=Sarah K.|last=White|website=Cio.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract risk management software (CRMS) for capital projects==
Very large enterprises, such as [[capital expenditure]] (capex) projects, involve multiple parties and high risk and uncertainty. They are unlike traditional operating contracts in that they are subject to shared deadlines in unique situations. As the complexity of these unique projects increases, the relationships between parties become more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apmg-international.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=8156&amp;sID=12573 |title=IACCM White Paper: The Basics of Contract and Commercial Management |website=Apmg-international.com |accessdate=2016-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112040244/http://www.apmg-international.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=8156&amp;sID=12573 |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires contract management software, or contract risk management software (CRMS), to become more dynamic and responsive.

The terms of these capex contracts necessarily involve assumptions at the start of the process, and are likely to change over the lifetime of the [[Project management|project lifecycle]]. For this reason, CRMS must be capable of recording one single instance of agreed changes to contract terms, and incorporating these changes in an auditable and legally robust way. With multiple decision makers involved, CRMS should also make accountability more transparent and enable faster decisions about variation proposals.&lt;ref name="8over8.com"/&gt;

'''Corporate sourcing''' refers to a system where divisions of companies coordinate the [[procurement]] and distribution of materials, parts, equipment, and supplies for the organization.  This is a [[supply chain]], [[purchasing]]/[[procurement]], and [[inventory]] function. This enables [[bulk discounting]], [[auditing]], and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley compliance]].

Duties of a corporate sourcing agent include:
#Coordinating all activities related to [[procurement]] of a [[commodity]] beginning with intent to purchase through delivery
#Analyzing the requirements of the commodity, including preliminary specifications, preferred supplier, and date commodity is needed
#Soliciting and evaluating proposals for the requested commodity. Investigating and/or interviewing potential suppliers to determine if they meet the specified requirements.

Some of corporate sourcing agents:
[[Richman Chemical]], [[Onetouch]], [[Worldwide Brands]], [[SAOS]]

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd|location= London|isbn=0-245-53472-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data Discovery and Query Builder''' (DDQB) is a data abstraction technology, developed by [[IBM]], that allows users to retrieve information from a data warehouse, in terms of the user's specific area of expertise instead of SQL.

DDQB serves the user through a web based graphical user interface and configurable data abstraction model (DAM), which contains both an understanding of the user knowledge domain and the database below it.

DDQB uses a set of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based customization tooling and can be deployed as a set of [[Web Services]].

The '''drink industry''' (also known as the '''beverage industry''') produces [[drink]]s, in particular [[ready to drink]] products. Drink production can vary greatly depending on the product being made. ManufacturingDrinks.com explains that, "bottling facilities differ in the types of [[bottling line]]s they operate and the types of products they can run". Drinks may be [[beverage can|canned]] or [[bottle]]d ([[Plastic bottle|plastic]] or [[glass bottle|glass]]), hot-fill or cold-fill, and natural or conventional. Innovations in the drink industry, catalysed by requests for [[non-alcoholic drink]]s, include: drink plants, drink processing, and drink packing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturingdrinks.com/Production/BeverageProduction.html |title=Beverage Production |publisher=Manufacturingdrinks.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic Case Filing System (ECFS)''' is an automated system developed in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]] that enables law enforcement agencies, criminal district attorney, county criminal courts, criminal district courts, and the defense bar to process and exchange information about criminal offenses.  ECFS software does not work on the Apple Mac platform.

== History ==

ECFS was conceived in November 2002 in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]]. Initially, the purpose of the system was to enable law enforcement agencies to submit offense reports to the criminal district attorney's office for possible prosecution. In July 2003, the Criminal District Attorney's accepted the first electronic case filing via ECFS.  Since that time, more than 100,000 cases have been filed in ECFS by the 47 Law Enforcement Agencies located in Tarrant County, Texas. ECFS was expanded in June 2004 to incorporate the Grand Jury function which is able to return Indictments to the Criminal District Courts on the same day that a True Bill is decided.

In January 2005, ECFS was extended to enable the Judges and their Court Staff to effectively manage the docket (case load) for each of the nine (9) Criminal District Courts. Since the implementation of ECFS, Tarrant County has been able to control the Jail population, despite a significant increase in the number of cases being filed. In August 2005, ECFS was extended to enable members of the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to browse and view defendant, offense, and evidence via ECFS. Through this process, defense attorneys are no longer required to visit the Criminal District Attorney's Office to view and copy file.

Since January 2006, the Criminal District Attorney's Office has been completely paperless and all Offense Reports are submitted via ECFS and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies, County and District Courts, and Defense Attorneys. In July 2006, ECFS was extended to allow criminal defendants to be masgistrated electronically.  This process also allows the Office of Attorney appointments to be notified that the defendant has requested that defense counsel be appointed which triggers a business process that captures financial information, facilitates a determination of indigency, and when appropriate appoints defense counsel.

In 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a non-profit charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, to access the ECFS system.  The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow subscribers to access files while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16121">An '''enterprise planning system''' covers the methods of planning for the internal and external factors that affect an [[Business|enterprise]].

These factors generally fall under [[PESTLE]]. PESTLE refers to political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors.  Regularly addressing PESTLE factors falls under [[operations management]]. Meanwhile, addressing any event, opportunity or challenge in any one or many factors for the first time will involve [[project management]].

As opposed to [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), enterprise planning systems have broader coverage. Enterprise planning systems address the resources that are available or ''not'' available to an enterprise and its ability to produce products or resources and/or provide services. It also considers those factors that will positively or negatively affect the firm's ability to run these actions.

Enterprise planning systems will tend to vary and are flexible. These are due to the periodic and adaptive nature of strategy formation. These will also have tactical aspects. Typically, enterprise planning systems are part of a firm's knowledge base or corporate structure whether it formally identified and structured or simply executed these when the need appeared.

== Purposes ==

An enterprise planning system will address at least three basic purposes to help the enterprise: 
* survive
* compete
* thrive

===Survival===
An enterprise will plan for tactical moves for quick reaction to the PESTLE threats that affect its survival. For instance, right after Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has experienced explosions due to the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, several enterprises (within and outside Japan) have publicly announced their course of actions to address the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Adam Gabbatt |author2=Richard Adams |author3=Ben Quinn |title=Japan tsunami and nuclear alert - Monday 14 March part two|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/mar/14/japan-tsunami-nuclear-alert-live|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=30 April 2011|location=London|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Meanwhile, an enterprise will plan for longer term strategic actions to address its competition or improve its [[competitiveness]]. For instance, enterprises will plan for, set budgets, implement and use [[strategic information systems]] as “information systems or information technology investments can be a source of competitive advantage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ward |author2=Joe Peppard |title=Strategic Planning for Information Systems 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex PO19 1UD, England|isbn=0-470-84147-8|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunities===
Most significantly, an enterprise will plan for using the PESTLE opportunities that are available to it. The profit and benefit motives justify most enterprise planning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massood Samii|title=Project Financial Evaluation|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-040-project-management-spring-2009/lecture-notes/|work=Lecture Notes MIT OpenCourseWare|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerabilities===

A fourth noteworthy purpose for enterprise planning systems is preparedness against terrorist attacks. As noted in the US Presidential Directive for [[Critical infrastructure protection]], terrorist groups are likely to attack commercial infrastructure for economic sabotage. Enterprises that are providing products or services that are critical to the economic system of a nation are potential targets of extremists.

== Strategic planning ==
Two major characteristics of EPSs are (1) variety and (2) flexibility. For instance, technological risks abound as even enterprise software are prone to [[obsolescence]] and [[disruptive innovation]]s. Technology is not stagnant. Thus, variety and flexibility work to the advantage of a strategically adaptive or [[agile management|agile]] enterprise as PESTLE conditions change.

To illustrate this some more, ERP software prescribes processes to realize its promised benefits. However, compliance to these rigid, prescribed processes is often assumed rather than real. In many cases, the ERP software is accepted but the practices within the enterprise reflect inconsistencies with the prescribed processes of the software. In a sense, variety and flexibility in a standard ERP implementation will still manifest in many ways such as "workarounds, shadow systems, various forms of unintended improvisations, and organizational 'drift'" as the [[knowledge worker]]s in the enterprise adapt to the realities of daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berente|first=Nicholas |author2=Danail Ivanov |author3=Betty Vandenbosch|title=Process Compliance and Enterprise System Implementation|journal=IEEE Computer Society|year=2007|volume=40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1530–1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With changing real world conditions, at least three components can structure enterprise strategy. These are:  
* analytical frameworks for the evaluation of PESTLE data at a given time
* geographic coverage of operations to manage risks or maximize benefits from [[macroeconomic]] forces or government regulations
* projects integration to efficiently support enterprise operations

=== Strategy via analysis ===
Frameworks of analysis usually drive a firm's strategy. These enable the firm to cope with the actions of its competitors, demands of its consumers or clients, nature of its operating environments, effects of government regulations in the places where it does business, or opportunities that are available among other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevan|title=Strategic Management|publisher=DK Publishing|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, United States of America|isbn=978-0-7566-4859-6|pages=16–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, team planning is crucial. One group will normally specialize in one aspect like operations or government regulations. Managing the interrelation of PESTLE factors requires teamwork in the enterprise planning process.

A sample framework for general analysis is the [[SWOT analysis]]. Another is the [[Balanced Scorecard]] for performance measurement analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=David P. Norton|title=Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via geography ===
Enterprise strategy can also refer to the mix of structured actions that address the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect a business or firm. These structured actions can be local, [[International|transnational]], global or combination of local, transnational or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mellahi, K., Frynas, J.G. &amp; Finlay, P.|title=Global Strategic Management|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-926615-9|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, enterprises can have any of the following geographic strategies in their plans:
* local strategy
* regional strategy (Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, etc.)
* international strategy
* global strategy
* global and local strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HSBC |title=The world's local bank |url=http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/ |work=2011 |publisher=HSBC Holdings plc 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303034643/http://www.hsbc.com/1/2 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via projects integration ===
Moreover, since management actions occur simultaneously in an enterprise, strategic planners can consider operations or [[project portfolio management]] (PPM) as crucial elements in an enterprise's strategic planning guide.

For instance, the need to have strategic priorities across many projects in companies with multiple product development projects have made executives borrow principles from investment portfolio management to better manage the distribution of resources compared with the assessed risks for each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Michael E.|title=Next Generation Product Development: How to Increase Productivity, Cut Costs, and Reduce Cycle Times|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=0-07-143512-3|pages=229–232, Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, PESTLE factors lead to strategy formation that will enable the enterprise to adapt to changing conditions. Meanwhile, the strategies that have been formed from the analytical framework processes of evaluating an enterprise's condition will lead to detailed plans which could be part of a firm's manual of operations or projects portfolio thrusts for funding and execution across the units or geographic coverage of the enterprise.

== Planning and budgeting ==
Enterprise planning and budgeting go hand-in-hand as the wherewithal to execute plans will determine the success or failure of an enterprise strategy. In another light, expanding or limiting the budget for a particular operations aspect of the enterprise or an ongoing project in favor of another will signal changes to an enterprise's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Xiall M.|title=Global Engineering Economics: Financial Decision Making for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-207161-1|pages=90–110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, planning and budgeting are integral parts of any enterprise planning systems as these impact the strategic directions of the enterprise.

For instance, enterprise projects tend to be mutually dependent with other projects to leverage a firm's engineering, financial and technology resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Project Management: Strategy and Organization in Automobile Product Development|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2492/SWP-3609-29056920.pdf?sequence=1|work=WP-3609-93 BPS|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|accessdate=April 27, 2011|first=Kentaro|last=Nobeoka|author2=Michael A. Cusumano|date=11 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A market research project will trigger a research, development and engineering (RD&amp;E) project for a new product. In turn, this RD&amp;E project could trigger a production strategy project to manufacture the new product at the most efficient locations to bring it closer to its target consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fujimoto |first=Takahiro |title=Production Strategy |url=http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Tokyo |accessdate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080343/http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, cutting the RD&amp;E project budget in half or increasing it twice will have profound effects in the long term direction of an enterprise as this will affect the other units of the firm undertaking projects that are linked to the RD&amp;E project.

===Classifications===

Enterprise planning and budgeting can be generally classified into:
* centralized
* devolved
* hybrid

'''Centralized.''' Headquarters or executive management directs all planning and budgets from the top then downwards in the organization hierarchy. It will closely follow Frederick Winslow Taylor's Principles of [[Scientific Management]].

'''Devolved.''' Middle managers set plans effectively steering the enterprise's strategic direction. Executive management takes into account that the enterprise has knowledge workers that are experts in their respective fields. The Management Board approves the proposed strategic direction under certain financial constraints such as expected returns on investment or equity.

'''Hybrid.''' Executive management determines and sets the strategic direction of the enterprise based on the inputs of middle managers and the rank and file. In this set up, plans and budgets are negotiated.

Essentially, enterprise plans and budgets can be detailed in a top-down approach, generalized in a bottom-up approach, or combined in a top-down and bottom-up approach.

== Group planning ==
Enterprise group planning will typically refer to the involvement of the major units of an enterprise such as the finance, marketing, production or technology departments. It can also refer to the involvement of the geographic units of a transnational or global firm. Some enterprises also involve external parties in their group planning where inputs from the crucial parts of the supply chain, cooperation and collaboration, or outsiders-looking-in are part of the firm's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usoro|first=Abel|author2=Abbas Abid |author3=Matthew Kuofie |title=Scales Construction for Organisational Variables that Influence the Use Of ICT for Global Planning|journal=International Journal of Global Business|date=December 2008|volume=1|series=1|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Richard|title=The Natural Laws of Business: How to Harness the Power of Evolution, Physics, and Economics to Achieve Business Success|year=2001|publisher=Doubleday, Random House Inc.|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-385-50159-5|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise group planning will usually manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Traditional meetings have required the physical presences of representatives from the various business units of the enterprise. With improvements in telecommunications, enterprise group planning can be conducted through video conferencing where participants may be dispersed geographically. However, video conferencing still appears to be an inadequate substitute when warm, interpersonal relations are part of the firm's culture.

Yet for fast-paced events like natural disasters or a meltdown of the financial markets that require immediate action from the enterprise, video conferencing might be the only option. Troubleshooting that requires the major resources of the enterprise will also entail enterprise group planning. Here, enterprise planning systems take a tactical form rather than a strategic focus to preserve the stability or ensure the survival of the enterprise.

== Transition plan ==
Enterprise transition plans will generally refer to change management-related actions in the case of mergers or in the implementation of an enterprise-wide project. The transition plan will cover the elimination of redundant functions in the case of a merger or the incorporation of new processes into business operations in the case of a technology project.

== Planning software ==
Enterprise planning software will have varied or depth of coverage but will not essentially refer to enterprise resource planning software. This will include planning-centric software and the tools to support strategic and tactical planning for and across the enterprise, such as:
* strategy formation and scenario planning software (for example, supporting [[Sales and operations planning]] process)
* performance measurement and evaluation software
* [[project management]] software
* [[data warehouse]] or [[business intelligence]] software
* [[enterprise optimization]] software

* [[Enterprise relationship management]]
* [[Enterprise information system]]

In [[business]], '''entrepreneurial networks''' are [[social organization]]s offering different types of [[resource (project management)|resources]] to start or improve [[entrepreneurial]] projects.  Having adequate [[human resources]] is a key factor for entrepreneurial achievements. Combined with [[leadership]], the entrepreneurial network is a social network not only necessary to properly run the business or project, but also to differentiate the business from similar projects. 

==Purpose==
The goal of most entrepreneurial networks is to bring together a broad selection of professionals and resources that complement each other's endeavors.  Initially, a priority is to aid successful [[business launch]]es.  Subsequently, to provide motivation, direction and increase access to [[business opportunity|opportunities]] and other skill sets.  Promotion of each member's talents and services both within the network and out in the broader market increases opportunities for all participants.

One of the key needs of any startup is [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and often entrepreneurial networks focus on providing such financial resources, particularly tailored to their membership [[demographic]].

Entrepreneurial networks may also become community involved, [[advocacy|endorsing]] reforms, [[legislation]] or other municipal drives that accommodate their organization's goals.

==Membership composition==
*lawyers, various specialties
*scientists
*engineers 
*[[architect]]s
*contractors/construction [[manager]]s
*[[real estate]] professionals
*suppliers 
*government people or institutions
*partners
*high skilled employees
*clients or any other kind of social contacts that can make the entrepreneurial business (or project) successful
* [[Mentoring|mentors]]
*[[investor]]s

==History==

Epos Now was founded by [[Jacyn Heavens]] in 2011 with no external investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

'''First Isabela Cooperative Bank'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=First Isabela Cooperative Bank|url=http://www.ficobank.com/corpoprofile.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, stylized as '''FICOBank'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FICOBank|url=http://www.ficobank.com/visualidentity.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a cooperative bank started in the mid-1970s. It is primarily engaged in financial intermediation between and among: [[farmer]]s, [[fisherman|fishers]] and their organizations; micro, small and medium [[entrepreneurs]]; rural, urban and overseas workers; and professionals, pensioners and other segments of the market. It also provides mobile-money, money-transfer/remittance and cash-dispensing services to the public. As of June 2018, FICOBank has 34 banking units located in the provinces of Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Cagayan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Pampanga, Pangasinan and Bulacan.

== History ==
The Philippine Cooperative Program of the ‘70s during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos administration]] paved the way for the organization of cooperative banks in the country. A group of technocrats led by Dr. Orlando J. Sacay, the recognized father of the [[Philippine]] cooperative banking system, worked for the enactment of Presidential Decree 175, espousing the formation of economic institutions or [[Cooperative|cooperatives]]. Composed of small farmers, these cooperatives were primarily organized to look after their own interests.

To serve as foundation of the cooperative rural banks and area marketing cooperatives, ''samahang nayon'' (pre-cooperatives) were organized in the rural areas. Thus, the triangular approach to rural development—production (under the ''samahang nayon''), credit (under a cooperative rural bank), and marketing (under an area marketing cooperative)—was put into operation. It was envisioned that there would be social equity, if these three vital functions of rural development will be placed in the hands of the farmers.

In 1973, the Regional Cooperative Development Program for Cagayan Valley (RCDP-CV) was launched to develop the farming communities of the region. With financial assistance from the [[Canadian International Development Agency]], the program sought to: improve farm productivity; diversify [[agricultural]] production; increase household income; and install a system of cooperatives, as an indispensable support mechanism. The institution of the cooperative rural banking system, as a major component of the program, was in line with the recognition of the importance of rural finance for development.

The [[Bank]] was officially formed on September 10, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Milestones|url=http://www.ficobank.com/milestone.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It was the time when the authorized representatives of two cooperatives and 47 ''samahang nayon'' unanimously agreed and voluntarily joined together to establish a cooperative rural bank in the [[province of Isabela]]. The primordial objective for its establishment was to provide financing to farmers and small entrepreneurs who have limited resources and access to banking services.

Originally, the Bank was registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]], as First Isabela Cooperative Rural Bank Inc. (FICRBI). On February 14, 1979, it acquired its juridical personality through SEC’s stamp of approval and registration. It was re-registered with the Bureau of Cooperative Development of the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development (BCOD-MLGCD) on April 10, 1979, under Certificate of Registration No. FF-119. The Central Bank of the Philippines granted the Bank its Certificate of Authority, numbered B-1000, on December 21, 1979 to operate as a cooperative rural bank. As such, it is vested with the rights to exercise all authority and powers, to do and perform all acts and to transact all businesses, which may be legally done by rural banks under the Rural Banking Act, and to do all other things incident thereto, as may be determined by the Monetary Board of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] (now known as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas).

The Bank was formally inaugurated on January 2, 1980. Being a cooperative bank, FICRBI (now FICOBank) is under the supervision of both the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). The latter was created by the enactment of Republic Act 6939. Together with Republic Act 6938 or the 1990 Cooperative Code of the Philippines, they are known as the twin Cooperative Laws of the country. In compliance with the provisions of the said laws, FICOBank obtained CDA’s confirmation of its registration, as a cooperative bank. Its Certificate of Confirmation, numbered 661, was issued by CDA on March 11, 1991.

After staying at the CAVADECO compound in [[Cauayan City, Isabela]] for about 15 years, FICOBank moved out and began its branching initiative to other parts of the province and its neighboring provinces in the region. In 1995, it opened its first branch in [[Roxas, Isabela]]. This was followed, in succession, by its branches in [[Alicia, Isabela|Alicia]] and Cauayan City, both in Isabela, in 1996. The Maddela Branch in [[Quirino province]] was opened in 1998. In the same year, its Jones Branch, also in Isabela, became its fifth branch. In 2003, its Cauayan Branch was transferred to [[Santiago (Philippine city)|Santiago City]]. A year later, the Bank’s Corporate Office—the nerve center of its operations—was inaugurated in its present location in Cauayan City, Isabela. A branch in [[Dupax del Sur]], the first operating unit of the Bank in the province of [[Nueva Vizcaya]], was also opened in the same year. It was later transferred to the municipality of [[Solano, Nueva Vizcaya|Solano]]. FICOBank established its foothold in the whole region by opening its branch in [[Solana, Cagayan]] in 2005.

Few years later, two field offices in [[Diffun, Quirino]] and [[Aurora, Isabela]] were opened, and two more branches in the municipalities of [[ Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]] and [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion in Tarlac]] were inaugurated. Field offices in [[San Mateo, Isabela|San Mateo]], [[Ilagan, Isabela|Ilagan City]], [[Echague, Isabela|Echague]], [[Tumauini, Isabela|Tumauini]] and [[Cabagan, Isabela|Cabagan]]—all in Isabela—and in [[Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya]] were opened, one after the other. The Bank also opened one branch each in the municipalities of [[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]] and Orani in Bataan and in [[Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija|Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija]], all in Region III. 

In 2009, FICOBank opened its five new branches, one in [[Cagayan]] and four in [[Pangasinan]]. The northernmost town of Aparri is the site of the new branch in Cagayan, while the municipalities of Umingan, Malasiqui, Lingayen and Mangaldan are the locations of the new branches of the Bank in the province of Pangasinan. The Orani Branch in Bataan was also transferred to Urdaneta City in Pangasinan in the same year. The Bank’s 27th operating unit was officially opened in Tuguegarao City in 2010. 

Its field offices were converted into extension offices, and all became full-fledged branches afterward. Its banking offices in Umingan (Pangasinan), Cabagan (Isabela) and Mangaldan (Pangasinan) were transferred to Guimba (Nueva Ecija), Gapan City (Nueva Ecija) and San Fernando City (Pampanga), respectively. Later on, five more branches were opened in Cauayan City (Isabela), Baliwag (Bulacan), and San Jose City, Rizal and Zaragoza (all in Nueva Ecija). In December 2017, the Bank inaugurated its 33rd banking unit in [[Abulug, Cagayan|Abulug (Cagayan)]]. And six (6) months later thereafter, FICOBank opened another branch in Cagayan, particularly in Gonzaga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">In [[marketing]], '''geomarketing''' (also called '''marketing geography''') is a discipline that uses [[geolocation]] ([[Geography|geographic]] information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the [[marketing mix]] – the product, price, promotion, or place ([[geo targeting]]).  [[Market segments]] can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing.

Geomarketing isapplied  in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp Geomarketing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080312045856/http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, [[Whois]] data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria.

[[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer.

==Geo marketing software==
[[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area.  It can be used to:
* Recommend nearby social events.&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level).
* Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; credit card information, VOIP address, etc.
* Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map.
* Locate a web client's computer on a digital map.
* Calculate summary information for specific areas.
* Select customers within specific areas.
* Select customers with a certain radius of a point.
* Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country.

Some of the software used includes [[Geoconcept]] Sales&amp;Marketing Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) [[GeoEdge]] (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful.

==Applications for Geo==

===Different content by choice===
Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/location-based-social-media-marketing/|title=Location Based Social Media Marketing|author=Lauren Wilson |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=22 August 2016|access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical example for different [[web content]] by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo —location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
Individuals can deliver different content in [[internet marketing]], through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical [[geolocation]] of the targeted audiences.

===Other applications===
* Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet
* Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management.
* Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers.
* Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations.
* Improve customer cooperation.
* Creation of sales territories

We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others.

With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field.

Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to [[comScore]], about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps.

One example of Geo Location is Google Maps - you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">'''Kiss up kick down''' (or '''suck up kick down''') is a [[neologism]] used to describe the situation where middle level employees in an organization are polite and [[flattering]] to superiors but [[abusive supervision|abusive to subordinates]].&lt;ref name=Paton1&gt;[http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/sites/default/files/transcripts/Tuesday_21_June_2011_-_transcript.pdf Mid Staffordshire Public Inquiry Transcript - day 103 - 21 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have originated in the US, with the first documented use having occurred in 1993. The concept can be applied to any social interaction where one person believes they have power over another person and believes that another person has power over them.&lt;ref name=Paton2&gt;Calum Paton The Policy of NHS Deficits and NHS Re-form in Health Policy and Politics 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;JJ Mearsheimer, D Shapley [http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0020x1.pdf MCNAMARA'S WAR]  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 00963402, Jul/Aug93, Vol.49, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use ==
===Robert McNamara===
The ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' described [[Robert McNamara]], an American business executive and the eighth [[United States Secretary of Defense]], as a classic case of the ''kiss up, kick down'' personality in August 1993.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt;

===John R. Bolton===
On day 2 of the Senate confirmation hearings, April 12, 2005, for [[John R. Bolton]], a [[George W. Bush|Bush]] nomination for the US representative to the UN, the Senate panel focused on allegations that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Former State Department intelligence chief [[Carl Ford|Carl W. Ford Jr.]] characterized Bolton as a "''kiss-up, kick-down'' sort of guy", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-12-bolton_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Critic says Bolton a 'kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy' | first1=Barbara | last1=Slavin | date=April 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
Calum Paton, Professor of Health Policy at [[Keele University]], describes ''kiss up kick down'' as a prevalent feature of the UK [[National Health Service]] culture. He raised this point when giving evidence at the [[Stafford_Hospital_scandal#Public_inquiry|Stafford Hospital scandal public inquiry]]. Credit is centralised and blame devolved. "''Kiss up kick down'' means that your middle level people will ''kiss-up'', they will please their masters, political or otherwise, and they will ''kick down'' to blame somebody else when things go wrong."
&lt;ref name=Paton1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Francis (barrister)|Robert Francis]] (Nov 29, 2011) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwnVE4GPbhs Organisational Culture seminar: opening statement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, NHS Trust bosses are nervous of reporting deficits and seek to under-report until it's too late. They seek to please their political superiors in the short term and shift blame down the line.&lt;ref name=Paton2/&gt;

==Blame in organizations==
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of [[blame]] in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicates organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg (March 5, 2006) [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kick up kiss down===
''Kick up kiss-down'' has been suggested as a viable more healthy dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Schachter (Jul. 25 2011) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/kicking-up-kissing-down/article616182/ Kicking up, kissing down]  The Globe and Mail&lt;/ref&gt; Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs.&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;

==In workplace bullying==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their [[abusive]] behavior hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against the bully's. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;Petrecca, L. (December 27 2010) Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. ''USA Today'' &lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;(15 Oct 2010) [http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Donohue (2 Oct 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager] The Huffington Post Csnada&lt;/ref&gt; The bully may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
the bully's fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt; DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a bully’s mistakes are always concealed or blamed on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* a bully keeps the target under constant [[Occupational stress|stress]]
* a bully’s power base is fear, not respect
* a bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* a bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate’s lack of competence, poor attitude, and/or character flaws
* a bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not.

In December 2009, [[United Airlines]] expressed interest in using the CS100 and CS300 for replacing its aging 737–300 and 737-500 aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/2009/12/10/united-to-consider-bombardier-cseries/ |title= United to consider Bombardier CSeries |work= Boeing and aerospace news |publisher= Seattle PI |date= 10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a future order is unlikely as airline has made orders for the [[Airbus A319]]-100 and the [[Boeing 737]]-800.

In March 2010, [[easyJet]] stated that the company was having "ongoing discussions with Bombardier regarding its CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |title=Airbus Weighs Costs, Rivals’ Advances in Engine Upgrade Choice |work=Businessweek |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326182513/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the airline has since ordered the Airbus A320-200 and A320neo.

In March 2018, it was stated that Garuda Indonesia wanted to order the CS300 as a replacement for the Bombardier CRJ-1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviatren.com/2018/03/10/garuda-indonesia-ganti-atr72-dan-crj1000-dengan-bombardier-cs300/|title=Garuda Indonesia Ganti ATR72 dan CRJ1000 dengan Bombardier CS300?trans-title=Garuda Indonesia to replace ATR72 and CRJ1000 with Bombardier CS300?|date=March 10, 2018|access-date=8 May 2018|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2297">{{About|information and analysis of a commercial market|information to support marketing activities|Marketing intelligence}}

'''Market intelligence''' is the information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident [[decision-making]] in determining strategy in areas such as [[market opportunity]], [[market penetration]] strategy, and [[market development]].&lt;ref name="Cornish"&gt;Cornish, S. L. “Product Innovation and the Spatial Dynamics of Market Intelligence: Does Proximity to Markets Matter?” Economic Geography. Volume: 73, Issue 2 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence includes the process of gathering data from the company’s external environment, whereas the [[Business intelligence]] process primarily is based on internal recorded events – such as sales, shipments and purchases. The purpose of incorporating Market Information or intelligence into the Business Intelligence process is to provide decision makers with a more “complete picture” of ongoing corporate performance in a set of given market conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, John and others, Proven Strategies in Competitive Intelligence (Wiley, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gathering market intelligence data ==
Effective market intelligence needs accurate market information that is gathered with right tools and methods. To gather information companies can conduct [[survey (human research)|survey]]s, [[interview]]s, visit and monitor competitors outlets or gather and buy data from different sources.

Traditional interviews and surveys can be done either in-house or by using specialists agencies. As more and more markets are digitalized the market intelligence space has seen a lot of new digital tools that companies can use. There are tools such as [https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home Google Consumer Survey] that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers. There are also specialist sites companies can buy market intelligence information and market intelligence software that companies can use to collect and monitor data from the internet.

The '''Network of International Business Schools''' ('''NIBS''') is an association of university-level [[business school|schools of business]] that promotes the incorporation of a strong international dimension into [[management]] training and [[Educational accreditation|accredits]] schools that offer internationally oriented business [[Curriculum|curricula]].  NIBS and its various member institutions advocate for the creation of business education programs that integrate internationalist skills and perspectives, including the practice of foreign languages, the study of comparative management techniques, and the experience of working and studying abroad.  They also facilitate cooperation between educational institutions in different countries, on the premise that this contributes to better relations between nations by deepening understanding of other cultures and social practices.  NIBS was formed in 1993 and currently has approximately 70 member institutions in over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |title= Member Schools |work= nibsweb.org |accessdate= April 11, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140946/http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |archivedate= April 13, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of NIBS recognize each other’s qualifications, have a common goal of collaboration, and encourage participation in the following:

* Student exchanges/interactions 
* Faculty exchanges/interactions 
* Exchanges of ideas for teaching programs 
* Joint teaching and research programs

The current president of NIBS is Hans van Oudheusden, who also serves as Head of International Relations at the School of Financial Management, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Previously, the position was held by Dr. David Gillingham, who served in the role from its inception in 1993 until 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= David Gillingham Award|url= http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|accessdate= 11 April 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141520/http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|archivedate= 13 April 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Ian Charles, who led the organization from 2012 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= IBA Associate Dean is the new NIBS President|url= http://uk.iba.dk/news/143-iba-associate-dean-is-the-new-nibs-president/#143|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

Since 2008, a key function of the organization has been the accreditation of internationally oriented [[business school|schools of business]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/accreditation/ |title=Accreditation|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NIBS accreditation is not intended to compete with long-established accreditation bodies, such as the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), or the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS); rather, it focuses on the degree to which the business school has become international in all facets of its organization. The NIBS accreditation scheme is thus generally regarded as a supplement to other accreditations, as well as a signal that an institution is committed to "deep" internationalization.

Any full member school of NIBS may apply for accreditation, which consists of a three-step process: completion of a self-assessment questionnaire on internationalization; a visit by an accreditation team; and a decision by the NIBS Board of Directors.  As of March 2018, a total of 24 institutions have been accredited by NIBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/about/member-schools/ |title=Member Schools|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

NIBS operates an annual business conference to present research findings and examine issues related to international business education. The 2017 event will be held in [[Leeds]], UK, and will focus on the role of business schools in preparing students for a rapidly changing global economy. NIBS is also publisher of the ''NIBS Journal'', a peer-reviewed academic journal focused on advancing business theory and practice with relevance to international managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |title= The NIBS Journal Mission |work= salisbury.edu |accessdate= April 16, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180857/http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |archivedate= April 16, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also sponsors two student competitions aimed at cultivating skills in international business and raising awareness of the importance of an international perspective to management: A business plan competition, and a business [[case competition]].

Founded in 1996, the NIBS Worldwide Case Competition is among the longest-running undergraduate business case competitions in the world.  In the current format, adopted in 2013, the event begins with a qualifying round, consisting of a written case analysis conducted under controlled conditions at participating universities.  The results of this qualifying round are then used to select the 16 teams that will advance to the championship round, which is held in a host city that rotates from year to year.  Past hosts of the championship round include:

'''Predictive modelling''' uses statistics to predict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Geisser|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Geisser. 
|title=Predictive Inference: An Introduction|page={{Page needed|date=September 2016}}|date=September 2016|publisher=Chapman &amp;  Hall|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1137379276|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of [[detection theory]] to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an [[email]] determining how likely that it is [[e-mail spam|spam]].

Models can use one or more [[classifier (mathematics)|classifiers]] in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set, say spam or 'ham'.

Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of [[machine learning]], as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as [[predictive analytics]].

Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest.  In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships.  This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that "correlation is not the same as causation."

==Models ==
[[File:Artificial Neural Network.jpg|alt=Artificial Neural Network|thumb|301x301px|An image of the interconnectedness of nodes in an artificial neural network.]]
Nearly any [[regression model]] can be used for prediction purposes.  Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: [[Parametric model|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric models|non-parametric]]. A third class, [[Semi-parametric model|semi-parametric]] models, includes features of both. Parametric models make "specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)",&lt;ref name=Sheskin&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheskin|first=David J.|title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures|date=April 27, 2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=1439858012|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; while non-parametric regressions make fewer assumptions than their parametric counterparts.&lt;ref name=Marascuilo&gt;{{cite book|last=Marascuilo|first=Leonard A.|title=Nonparametric and distribution-free methods for the social sciences|date=December 1977|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|isbn=0818502029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinary Least Squares===
[[Ordinary least squares]] is a method that minimizes the sum of squared distances between observed and predicted values.

===Generalized Linear Models (GLM)===
The [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) is a flexible family of models that are unified under a single method.  [[Logistic regression]] is a notable special case of GLM. Other types of GLM include [[Poisson regression]], gamma regression, and [[multinomial regression]].

===Logistic regression===
[[Logistic regression]] is a technique in which unknown values of a discrete variable are predicted based on known values of one or more continuous and/or [[discrete variable]]s. [[Logistic regression]] differs from [[Ordinary least squares|ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]] in that the dependent variable is binary in nature. This procedure has many applications. In [[biostatistics]], the researcher may be interested in trying to model the probability of a patient being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer based on knowing, say, the incidence of that cancer in his or her family. In business, the marketer may be interested in modelling the probability of an individual purchasing a product based on the price of that product. Both of these are examples of a simple, binary logistic regression model.  The model is "simple" in that each has only one independent, or predictor, variable, and it is "binary" in that the dependent variable can take on only one of two values: cancer or no cancer, and purchase or does not purchase.

===Generalized additive models===
[[Generalized additive model]] is a smoothing method for multiple predictors that allows for non-parametric predictions.

===Robust regression===
[[Robust regression]] includes a number of modelling approaches to handle high leverage observations or violation of assumptions. Models can be both parametric (e.g. regression with Huber, White, Sandwich variance estimators) and non-parametric(e.g. quantile regression).&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Rand R.|title=Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441955240|pages=200–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiparametric regression===
[[Semiparametric regression]] includes the proportional odds model and the Cox proportional hazards model where the response is a rank.

==Presenting and using the results of a predictive model==
Predictive models can either be used directly to estimate a response (output) given a defined set of characteristics (input), or indirectly to drive the choice of decision rules.&lt;ref name=Steyerberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Steyerberg|first=Ewout W.|title=Clinical Prediction Models|date=October 21, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441926488|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the methodology employed for the prediction, it is often possible to derive a formula that may be used in a '''spreadsheet software'''.  This has some advantages for end users or decision makers, the main one being familiarity with the software itself, hence a lower barrier to adoption.
  
'''Nomograms''' are useful graphical representation of a predictive model.  As in spreadsheet software, their use depends on the methodology chosen.  The advantage of nomograms is the immediacy of computing predictions without the aid of a computer.

'''Point estimates''' tables are one of the simplest form to represent a predictive tool.  Here combination of characteristics of interests can either be represented via a table or a graph and the associated prediction read off the y-axis or the table itself.
 
'''Tree-based methods''' (e.g. CART, survival trees) provide one of the most graphically intuitive ways to present predictions. However, their usage is limited to those methods that use this type of modelling approach which can have several drawbacks.&lt;ref name=Breiman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breiman|first=Leo|title=Bagging predictors|journal=Machine Learning|date=August 1996|volume=24|issue=2|pages=123–140|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018054314350|doi=10.1007/bf00058655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees can also be employed to represent decision rules graphically.

'''Score charts''' are graphical tabular or graphical tools to represent either predictions or decision rules.

A new class of '''modern tools''' are represented by web-based applications.  For example, Shiny is a web-based tool developed by Rstudio, an R IDE.  With a Shiny app, a modeller has the advantage to represent any which way he or she chooses to represent the predictive model while allowing the user some control.  A user can choose a combination of characteristics of interest via sliders or input boxes and results can be generated, from graphs to confidence intervals to tables and various statistics of interests. However, these tools often require a server installation of Rstudio.

==Applications==

===Uplift modelling===
[[Uplift modelling]] is a technique for modelling the ''change in probability'' caused by an action. Typically this is a marketing action such as an offer to buy a product, to use a product more or to re-sign a contract. For example, in a
retention campaign you wish to predict the change in probability that a customer will remain a customer if they are contacted. A model of the change in probability allows the retention campaign to be targeted at those customers on whom the change in probability will be beneficial. This allows the retention programme to avoid triggering unnecessary [[churn rate|churn]] or [[customer attrition]] without wasting money contacting people who would act anyway.

===Archaeology===
Predictive modelling in [[archaeology]] gets its foundations from [[Gordon Willey]]'s mid-fifties work in the Virú Valley of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1953) "Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Virú Valley, Peru", Bulletin 155. Bureau of American Ethnology&lt;/ref&gt; Complete, intensive surveys were performed then [[Covariance|covariability]] between cultural remains and natural features such as slope, and vegetation were determined.  Development of quantitative methods and a greater availability of applicable data led to growth of the discipline in the 1960s and by the late 1980s, substantial progress had been made by major land managers worldwide.

Generally, predictive modelling in archaeology is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., and the presence of archaeological features.  Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the "archaeological sensitivity" of unsurveyed areas can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas.  Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD),&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberg, Kurt, et al.  "An Evaluation of the Archaeological Sample Survey Program at the Nevada Test and Training Range",  SRI Technical Report 02-16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Altschul, Lynne Sebastian, and Kurt Heidelberg, "Predictive Modeling in the Military: Similar Goals, Divergent Paths", Preservation Research Series 1, SRI Foundation, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy.  By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites.

===Customer relationship management===
Predictive modelling is used extensively in analytical [[customer relationship management]] and [[data mining]] to produce customer-level models that describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. The actions are usually sales, marketing and customer retention related.&lt;ref&gt;http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/wondering-what-lies-ahead-the-power-of-predictive-modeling/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a large consumer organization such as a mobile telecommunications operator will have a set of predictive models for product [[cross-sell]], product deep-sell (or [[upselling]]) and [[churn rate|churn]]. It is also now more common for such an organization to have a model of savability using an [[uplift modelling|uplift model]]. This predicts the likelihood that a customer can be saved at the end of a contract period (the change in churn probability) as opposed to the standard churn prediction model.

===Auto insurance===
Predictive modelling is utilised in [[vehicle insurance]] to assign risk of incidents to policy holders from information obtained from policy holders. This is extensively employed in [[usage-based insurance]] solutions where predictive models utilise telemetry-based data to build a model of predictive risk for claim likelihood.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Black-box auto insurance predictive models utilise [[GPS]] or [[accelerometer]] sensor input only.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some models include a wide range of predictive input beyond basic telemetry including advanced driving behaviour, independent crash records, road history, and user profiles to provide improved risk models.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Health care===
In 2009 [[Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System]] began analyzing electronic medical records in order to use predictive modeling to help identify patients at high risk of readmission. Initially the hospital focused on patients with congestive heart failure, but the program has expanded to include patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/hospital-uses-data-analytics-and-predictive-modeling-identify-and-allocate-scarce-resources |title=Hospital Uses Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling To Identify and Allocate Scarce Resources to High-Risk Patients, Leading to Fewer Readmissions |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Banerjee et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Imon |title=Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) Utilizing Free-Text Clinical Narratives |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=8 |issue=10037 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27946-5 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) for estimating short-term life expectancy (&gt;3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence.The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). It achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. To provide explain-ability, they developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model’s predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable the model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians.

=== Algorithmic trading ===
Predictive modeling in trading is a modeling process wherein we predict the probability of an outcome using a set of [[explanatory variable|predictor variables]]. Predictive models can be built for different assets like stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/predictive-modeling-algorithmic-trading/|title=Implementing Predictive Modeling in R for Algorithmic Trading|date=2016-10-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive modeling is still extensively used by trading firms to devise strategies and trade. It utilizes mathematically advanced software to evaluate indicators on price, volume, open interest and other historical data, to discover repeatable patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://systemtradersuccess.com/predictive-model-based-trading-systems-2/|title=Predictive-Model Based Trading Systems, Part 1 - System Trader Success|date=2013-07-22|newspaper=System Trader Success|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable failures of predictive modeling===
Although not widely discussed by the mainstream predictive modeling community, predictive modeling is a methodology that has been widely used in the financial industry in the past and some of the major failures contributed to the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. These failures exemplify the danger of relying exclusively on models that are essentially backward looking in nature. The following examples are by no mean a complete list:

1) Bond rating. S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch quantify the [[probability of default]] of bonds with discrete variables called rating. The rating can take on discrete values from AAA down to D. The rating is a predictor of the risk of default based on a variety of variables associated with the borrower and historical [[macroeconomic]] data. The rating agencies failed with their ratings on the US$600 billion mortgage backed Collateralized Debt Obligation ([[Collateralized debt obligation|CDO]]) market. Almost the entire AAA sector (and the super-AAA sector, a new rating the rating agencies provided to represent super safe investment) of the CDO market defaulted or severely downgraded during 2008, many of which obtained their ratings less than just a year previously.

2) So far, no statistical models that attempt to predict equity market prices based on historical data are considered to consistently make correct predictions over the long term. One particularly memorable failure is that of [[Long Term Capital Management]], a fund that hired highly qualified analysts, including a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner, to develop a sophisticated statistical model that predicted the price spreads between different securities. The models produced impressive profits until a major debacle that caused the then [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] to step in to broker a rescue plan by the [[Wall Street]] broker dealers in order to prevent a meltdown of the bond market.

=== Possible fundamental limitations of predictive model based on data fitting===

1) History cannot always accurately predict the future: Using relations derived from historical data to predict the future implicitly assumes there are certain lasting conditions or constants in a complex system. This almost always leads to some imprecision when the system involves people.

2) The issue of unknown unknowns: In all data collection, the collector first defines the set of variables for which data is collected. However, no matter how extensive the collector considers his/her selection of the variables, there is always the possibility of new variables that have not been considered or even defined, yet are critical to the outcome.

3) Self-defeat of an algorithm: After an algorithm becomes an accepted standard of measurement, it can be taken advantage of by people who understand the algorithm and have the incentive to fool or manipulate the outcome. This is what happened to the CDO rating described above. The CDO dealers actively fulfilled the rating agencies' input to reach an AAA or super-AAA on the CDO they were issuing, by cleverly manipulating variables that were "unknown" to the rating agencies' "sophisticated" models.

{{Competition law}}
Though in general, each business may decide with whom they wish to deal, there are some situations when a '''refusal to deal''' may be considered an unlawful [[anti-competitive practice]], if it prevents or reduces [[competition]] in a [[Market (economics)|market]]. The unlawful behaviour may involve two or more companies refusing to use, buy from or otherwise deal with a person or business, such as a competitor, for the purpose inflicting some economic loss on the target or otherwise force them out of the market. A refusal to deal (also known as a group [[boycott]]) is forbidden in some countries which have restricted market economies, though the actual acts or situations which may constitute such unacceptable behaviour may vary significantly between jurisdictions. 

==Definitions==
Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission defines the refusal to deal as:

{{Quote|Agreements involving [[competitor]]s that involve restricting the supply of goods are prohibited if they have the purpose or effect of substantially lessening [[competition]] in a market in which the businesses operate.|Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|Refusal to deal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Refusal to deal|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ACCC Publishing Unit|isbn=1-921227-28-1|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/publications/refusal-to-deal |author=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indian Competition Act 2002 defines the refusal to deal as:
{{Quote|"Refusal to deal" includes any agreement which restricts, or is likely to restrict, by any method the persons or classes of persons to whom goods are sold or from whom goods are bought|The Competition Act|2002 (India) S4-d}}

A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job [[experience]] and [[education]], as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a [[cover letter]] and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential [[employer]] sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to [[Screening (economics)|screen]] applicants, often followed by an [[interview]].

The [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the résumé—a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.

Generally, the résumé is substantially shorter than a CV in [[English Canada]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Alison |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/curriculumvitae/f/cvresume.htm |title=The Difference Between a Resume and a Curriculum Vitae |website=Jobsearch.about.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, [[biodata]] is often used in place of a résumé.&lt;ref name="Sehgal2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=M. K.|title=Business Communication|year=2008|publisher=Excel Books |language=English|isbn=9788174465016|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As has been indicated above, the word résumé comes from the French word {{lang|fr|résumé}} meaning "summary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam-Webster| accessdate=9 March 2015| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resume| title=resume| quote=French résumé, from past participle of résumer to resume, summarize, from Middle French resumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is credited with the first résumé, though his "résumé" takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pratt|first1=Síofra|title=3 Lessons Every Job Seeker Can Learn from the World’s Oldest CV|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141015111116-2417166-3-lessons-every-job-seeker-can-learn-from-the-world-s-oldest-cv|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skills of Leonardo da Vinci|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/skills-of-da-vinci.html|website=Lettersofnote.com|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next roughly 450 years, the résumé continued to be a mere description of a person, and included their abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés listed things like weight, height, marital status, and religion. It was not until 1950 that the résumé evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, résumés were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Résumés can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired than a one-page resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbsnews.com/news/your-one-page-resume-may-be-killing-your-job-search/|title=Your one-page resume may be killing your job search|last=Ivanova|first=Irina|date=|website=CBS News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A résumé is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of résumés directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master résumé' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's résumé, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].

==Styles==
Résumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:

===Reverse chronological résumé===
A reverse chronological résumé lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly used by those who are not professional résumé writers. In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological résumé is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.

===Functional résumé===
A functional  résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.

The functional résumé is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional résumé works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional résumé is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional résumé is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.

===Hybrid résumé===
The hybrid résumé balances the functional and [[chronological]] approaches. A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers. The hybrid has a tendency to repeat itself and is, therefore, less widely used than the other two.

===Online résumés===
As the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept résumés electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based résumé is an exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employers now find candidates' résumés through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a résumé. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés. Job ads may direct applicants to email a résumé to a company or visit its website and submit a résumé in an electronic format.

Many employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving résumés in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.

Another consideration for electronic résumé documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]]. [[Resume parsing|Résumé parsers]] may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the résumé but not other parts. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data. Résumés written in a standard format are more likely to be correctly interpreted by résumé parsers, and thereby may make the candidate more findable.

One advantage for employers to online résumés is the significant cost saving compared to traditional hiring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/hrcenter/weddlesguide/19990405-weddle.html |title=Career Advice, Find a Job &amp; Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal |website=Careerjournal.com |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that potential employers no longer have to sort through massive stacks of paper.

===Infographic, video and website résumés===
As the Internet becomes more driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional paper and email media.

[[Video resume|Video]], infographic, and even [[Vine (service)|Vine]] résumés have gained popularity, though mainly in the creative and media industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-resumes-that-got-worldwide-attention-194410148.html |title=10 Resumes That Got Worldwide Attention |last=Shontell |first=Alyson |date=27 February 2013  | website=finance.yahoo.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has attracted criticism from [[human resources management]] professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and point out that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose [[workflow]] is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/05/18/recruiters-tell-us-do-resume-fads-really-work/ |title=Recruiters Tell Us: Do Résumé Fads Really Work? |date=18 May 2012  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé evaluation==
Many résumé development agencies offer résumé evaluation services wherein they evaluate the résumé and suggest any necessary changes. Candidates are free to either do those changes themselves or may take help of the agency itself. Some career fields include a special section listing the lifelong works of the author: for computer-related fields, the [[softography]]; for musicians and composers, the [[discography]]; for actors, a [[filmography]].

Keeping résumés online has become increasingly common for people in professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail that are offered by an HTML résumé, such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv/actorcv.htm |title=How to Write an Actor's/Singer's CV | website=Kent University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job seekers are finding an ever-increasing demand to have an electronic version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use [[Internet recruiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/05/07/cb.e.resume/index.html?iref=nextin |title= An E-friendly Résumé in 5 Easy Steps |last=Presely |first=Eric |date=8 May 2008  | website=cnn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online résumé distribution services have emerged to allow job seekers to distribute their résumés to numerous employers of their choice through email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/the-future-of-the-resume/2269763 |title= The Future of the Resume|last=Burdick |first=Cody |date=17 March 2016  | website=Tampa Bay Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé as one part of a personal branding mix==
In some sectors, particularly in the [[Startup company|startup]] community, use of traditional résumé has seen a consistent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/is-the-resume-dead/article18988834/ |title=Is The Resume Dead? |last=Lawrence |first=Daina |date=5 June 2014  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While standalone résumés are still used to apply for jobs, job-seekers may also view their résumés as one of a number of assets which form their [[personal branding|personal brand]] and work together to strengthen their job application. In this scenario, résumés are generally used to provide a potential employer with factual information (e.g., achievements), while the social media platforms give insight into the job-seekers' motivations and personality in development.

An '''undervalue transaction''' is a transaction entered into by a [[company (law)|company]]&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems also apply undervalue transactions to insolvent individuals&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]] which the court orders be set aside, usually upon the application of a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] for the benefit of the debtor's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and section 558FB of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] in [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Australian insolvency law]] they are referred to as '''uncommercial transactions'''.

Under ordinary principles of [[contract law]], the courts will not generally look into the adequacy of the [[consideration]] provided by either side.  However, if a company is in real peril of going into bankruptcy, many legal systems provide a mechanism that transactions which are seriously commercially disadvantageous to the company can be unwound, so as to prevent prejudice to the creditors of the company.

Normally, for a transaction to be set aside as an undervalue transaction, the liquidator or equivalent must demonstrate that:
#the consideration received by the company in the transaction, in money or money's worth is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, provided by the company;
#the transaction was entered into during the "vulnerability period"; and
#at the time of the transaction, the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, or became unable to pay its debts as they fell due as a result of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This is the ''cash-flow'' test of insolvency.  Some jurisdictions (although not many) apply the ''balance-sheet'' test of insolvency to undervalue transactions, either as an alternative to the cash-flow test, or in addition to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vulnerability period is the period of time immediately prior to the company going into bankruptcy.  The length of the vulnerability period varies between countries, and some countries apply different vulnerability periods in different circumstances.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the vulnerability period is either:
#two years, if the person with whom the company entered into the transaction with is a "connected person",&lt;ref&gt;Connected person is usually defined under the relevant legislation, e.g. in the United Kingdom, see section 249 of the Insolvency Act, and which is drafted so as to try and catch all insiders and affiliates, other than employees&lt;/ref&gt; or
#6 months, in all other cases.
The period is calculated by reference to the period of time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation or administration.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an undervalue transaction varies.  Inevitably the other party to the transaction who received the benefit has to return the benefit (or account for it) it to the liquidator.  In some countries the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Many jurisdictions which have prohibitions on undervalue transactions also provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] where the [[Board of directors|directors]] are of a view that it is for the benefit of the company, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

'''Unfair (or disloyal) competition''' in [[commercial law]] is a deceptive business practice that causes economic harm to other businesses or to consumers.&lt;ref name="FindLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-laws-and-regulations/unfair-competition-.html|website=FindLaw.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unfair_competition|publisher=Legal Information Institute of Cornell University Law School|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a number of areas of law involving acts by one competitor or group of competitors which harm another in the field, and which may give rise to [[Crime|criminal offenses]] and civil [[Cause of action|causes of action]]. The most common actions falling under the banner of unfair competition include:

* Matters pertaining to [[antitrust]] law, known in the [[European Union]] as [[competition law]]. Antitrust violations constituting unfair competition occur when one competitor attempts to force others out of the market (or prevent others from entering the market) through tactics such as [[predatory pricing]] or obtaining exclusive purchase rights to raw materials needed to make a competing product.
* [[Trademark infringement]] and [[passing off]], which occur when the maker of a product uses a name, logo, or other identifying characteristics to deceive consumers into thinking that they are buying the product of a competitor. In the [[United States]], this form of unfair competition is prohibited under the [[common law]] and by state statutes, and governed at the federal level by the [[Lanham Act]].
* [[Misappropriation]] of [[trade secret]]s, which occurs when one competitor uses [[espionage]], [[bribery]], or outright [[theft]] to obtain economically advantageous information in the possession of another. In the United States, this type of activity is forbidden by the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] and the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]].
* [[Trade libel]], the spreading of false information about the quality or characteristics of a competitor's products, is prohibited at common law.
* [[Tortious interference]], which occurs when one competitor convinces a party having a relationship with another competitor to breach a contract with, or duty to, the other competitor is also prohibited at common law.

Various [[unfair business practices]] such as [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]] [[contract]]s may be considered unfair competition, if they give one competitor an advantage over others. In the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the principles laid down in the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. (See also [[trade regulation]] law.)

'''Vehicle leasing''' is the [[leasing]] (or the use) of a [[motor vehicle]] for a fixed period of time at an agreed amount of money for the lease. It is commonly offered by dealers as an alternative to vehicle purchase but is widely used by businesses as a method of acquiring (or having the use of) vehicles for business, without the usually needed cash outlay. The key difference in a lease is that after the primary term (usually 2, 3 or 4 years) the vehicle has to either be returned to the leasing company or purchased for the [[Profit (accounting)|residual]] value.

==Rationale==
Vehicle leasing offers advantages to both buyers and sellers. For the buyer, lease payments will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be.  Any sales tax is due only on each monthly payment, rather than immediately on the entire purchase price as in the case of a loan.  Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a new model when the lease expires, allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few years without the responsibility of selling the old vehicle, or possible repair costs after expiry of the manufacturer's warranty. A lessee does not have to worry about the future value of the vehicle, while a vehicle owner does. For a business lessor there are tax advantages to be considered.

For the seller, leasing generates income from a vehicle the seller (or manufacturing corporation) still owns and will be able to lease again or sell through [[vehicle remarketing]] once the original (or primary) lease has expired. As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time than one they buy outright, leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly, which may fit into various aspects of a dealer's business model.

==Market penetration==
Leasing's average retail market penetration rate in the United States for new passenger vehicles reached an all-time record high of 26.5% in February 2014.&lt;ref name="JDP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://autos.jdpower.com/content/press-release/0VoTMNq/j-d-power-reports-auto-buyers-are-committing-to-leasing-and-long-term-loans-at-record-levels.htm| title=J.D. Power Reports: Auto Buyers Are Committing To Leasing And Long-Term Loans At Record Levels| publisher=[[J. D. Power and Associates|J.D. Power]], [[McGraw Hill Financial]]| date= 2014-02-06| accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a recovery from a severe drop during the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. As of 2016, leasing accounted for about 25 percent of total vehicle sales or 31 percent retail sales in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popely|first1=Rick|title=Glut of off-lease cars makes it good time to buy used|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2017/03/30/buying-used-leases/99797378/|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=30 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of leasing in the United States for [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]] have been rising close to the industry norm since reaching low single digits in 2009, but still lower than [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name="JDPmanu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niada.com/uploads/dynamic_areas/wp6QIPSw6C83LYM1dGrU/33/UCMR_2014_Final.pdf| title=2014 Used Car MarketReport| pages=24|publisher=[[Manheim Auctions|Manheim Consulting]]| accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lease agreement==
Lease agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number of miles a lessee can drive (for passenger cars, a common number is 10,000 miles per annum though the amount can be stipulated by the customer and can be 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, fees may apply. Dealers will typically allow a lessee to negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment. Lease agreements usually specify how much wear on the vehicle is allowable, and the lessee may face a fee if that amount of wear has been exceeded.&lt;ref name="fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/leasing/|title=FRB: Leasing Guide|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lease with maintenance (commonly known in the UK as Contract Hire) can include all vehicle running costs excluding fuel and insurance.

The actual lease payments are calculated in a very similar way to loan payments, but instead of an [[Annual percentage rate|APR]], the company uses something called the [[money factor]].

At the end of a lease's term, the lessee must either return the vehicle to or buy it from the owner. The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when the lease is signed.&lt;ref name="fr" /&gt;

Typically a leasing company will have a minimum length of lease such as 24 months up-to 60 months. Recently a new view on leasing is that the market has grown for short term lease called 'flexi-lease'. Flexi-lease is when a person can lease a new vehicle for 3 months and then choose to hand the car/van back or indeed extend the lease for another period. This is almost the same as van hire but typically involves the finance or leasing company maintaining and being ultimately responsible for the vehicle.

== UK Vehicle Leasing ==
Similarly to the US automotive market, leasing a vehicle enables you to have access to a vehicle that you might otherwise be unable to afford if you were to finance the full value. Compared to a PCP method of finance, leasing is far more benefical if you plan on changing your vehicle at the end of the initial contract, rather than taking ownership.

=== Market Overview ===
In the UK the leasing market has historically been dominated by businesses and fleet customers. In recent years however the market has shifted and now personal contracts have the biggest market share. This is largely influenced by increasing company car tax for drivers (BIK) and taxable allowances for businesses being affected by vehicle emissions. For company car users who opt out, a personal lease contract allows them to have a fixed monthly payment that's subsidised by their employer, but also allows for a more flexible choice of vehicles than a rigid company car policy.

'''Whitewash Resolution''' is a proposed resolution for the waiver of rights of independent [[shareholder]]s to receive a mandatory [[takeover]] from the [[investor]] and its concert parties for the [[voting share|ordinary share]]s of the [[company]] not already owned or controlled by them.

A whitewash waiver is a [[corporate law]] concept originating in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  In some cases an investor will apply to the Executive for the Whitewash Waiver, which, if granted, will be subject to the approval of independent shareholders.
