[[Image:Vasnetsov Razvlechenie.jpg|300px|thumb|''Amusement'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

'''Amusement''', from the old French ''à muser'' – to put into a stupid stare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6786#eid4700112|title=Amuse, v.|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford English Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the state of [[experience|experiencing]] [[humour|humorous]] and [[entertainment|entertaining]] events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with [[enjoyment]], [[happiness]], [[laughter]] and [[pleasure]]. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.

Amusement is considered an "epistemological" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shiota, M. N., Keltner, D., &amp; John, O. P.|title=Positive emotion dispositions differentially associated with Big Five personality and attachment style.|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2006|volume=1|issue=2|pages=61–71|doi=10.1080/17439760500510833|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.1730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.

Current studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and sociology.  In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less 'amusing' than another, similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.

==Theories==

Two different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:

=== Evolutionary ===
The evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shiota, M. N., Campos, B., Keltner, D., &amp; Hertenstein, M. J.|title=Positive emotion and the regulation of interpersonal relationships in The Regulation of Emotion|date=2004|publisher=Philippot, P. &amp; Feldman, R. S. Eds. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=127–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latta, R. L.|title=The basic humor process: A cognitive-shift theory and the case against incongruity.|date=1999|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coser|first1=Rose Laub|title=Some Social Functions of Laughter|journal=Human Relations|date=1 April 2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=171–182|doi=10.1177/001872675901200205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructed emotion ===
The [[theory of constructed emotion]] suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=Solving the emotion paradox: Categorization and the experience of emotion|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=20–46|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_2|pmid=16430327|citeseerx=10.1.1.577.4057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|pmid=27798257|pmc=5390700|year=2017|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotional expression of amusement ==
The origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner, D., Tracy, J. L., Sauter, D. A., Cordaro, D. C. &amp; McNeil, G.|title=Expression of Emotion.| journal=In Barrett, L. F., Lewis, M. &amp; Haviland-Jones, J. M. Eds., Handbook of Emotions|date=2016|volume=4th|pages=467–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, Darwin published his book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals|orig-year=1872|year=1998|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, [[Paul Ekman]], an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman|first1=Paul|title=The argument and evidence about universals in facial expressions|journal=Handbook of Social Psychophysiology|date=1989|pages=143–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work focused on six basic emotions: [[happiness]], [[anger]], [[sadness]], [[fear]], [[disgust]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman, P., Sorenson, E. R., &amp; Friesen, W. V.|title=Pan-cultural elements in facial displays of emotion|journal=Science|date=1969|volume=164|issue=3875|pages=86–88|doi=10.1126/science.164.3875.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekman, P., &amp; Rosenberg, E. L. (Eds.).|title=What the face reveals: Basic and applied studies of spontaneous expression using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Displays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner|first1=Dacher|title=Signs of appeasement: Evidence for the distinct displays of embarrassment, amusement, and shame|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=68|issue=3|pages=441–454|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.441|citeseerx=10.1.1.420.9278}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon-Thomas, E. R., Keltner, D. J., Sauter, D., Sinicropi-Yao, L., &amp; Abramson, A.|title=The voice conveys specific emotions: evidence from vocal burst displays|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9 |issue=6|pages=838–846|doi=10.1037/a0017810|pmid=20001126|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laukka, P., Elfenbein, H. A., Söder, N., Nordström, H., Althoff, J., Chui, W., ... &amp; Thingujam, N. S.|title=Cross-cultural decoding of positive and negative non-linguistic emotion vocalizations.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|pages=353|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00353|pmid=23914178|pmc=3728469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauter, D.

[[File:Ron Killings &amp; Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|Professional wrestlers [[Vince McMahon]] (right) and [[Ron Killings]] (left) showing amused facial expressions]]

=== Facial expression ===
An amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Intelligence Quiz|url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/take_quiz/ei_quiz|website=Greater Good Science Center|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Head: Thrown back with jaw lifted
*Eyes: Crow's feet at the eyes indicating that the muscles have tightened
*Mouth: Open, jaw dropped with relaxed muscles

=== Vocal burst ===
The expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural considerations ==

As a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Jeanne L.|title=Ideal affect: Cultural causes and behavioral consequences.|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|pmid=26151968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical uses==
=== Emotion regulation ===

Emotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=James J.|title=The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=271–299|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.7042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giuliani, N. R., McRae, K., &amp; Gross, J. J.|title=The up-and down-regulation of amusement: experiential, behavioral, and autonomic consequences|journal=Emotion|date=2008|volume=8|issue=5|pages=714–719|doi=10.1037/a0013236|pmid=18837622|pmc=4138973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugade, M. M., &amp; Fredrickson, B. L.|title=Regulation of positive emotions: Emotion regulation strategies that promote resilience|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=2007|volume=8|issue=3|pages=311–333|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience ===

As a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bai, S., &amp; Repetti, R. L.|title=Short‐term resilience processes in the family.|journal=Family Relations|date=2015|volume=64|issue=1|pages=108–119|doi=10.1111/fare.12101|pmid=26246651|pmc=4523303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson, B. L., Tugade, M. M., Waugh, C. E., &amp; Larkin, G. R.|title=What good are positive emotions in crisis? A prospective study of resilience and emotions following the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11th, 2001|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=84|issue=2|pages=365–376|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.365|pmid=12585810|pmc=2755263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotions help people build social resources that foster their ability to cope during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugade, M. M., Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Feldman Barrett, L. (2004).|title=Psychological resilience and positive emotional granularity: Examining the benefits of positive emotions on coping and health.|journal=Journal of Personality|date=2004|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1161–1190|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00294.x|pmid=15509280|pmc=1201429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in resilience lead to higher [[life satisfaction]] and general happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Michael A.|last2=Fredrickson|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Brown|first3=Stephanie L.|last4=Mikels|first4=Joseph A.|last5=Conway|first5=Anne M.|date=2009|title=Happiness Unpacked: Positive Emotions Increase Life Satisfaction by Building Resilience|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)|volume=9|issue=3|pages=361–368|doi=10.1037/a0015952|issn=1528-3542|pmc=3126102|pmid=19485613}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Laughter Yoga.jpg|thumb|People engaging in laughter therapy]]

=== Laughter therapy ===

Rapidly growing in popularity, [[laughter]] therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burbank|first1=Luke|title=The Growing Popularity of Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5165226|website=NPR.org|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the bodies' muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/|website=Cancer Treatment Centers of America|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed benefits include: Stress management,&lt;ref name="MayoClinicLaughter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Stress relief from laughter? It's no joke|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456|website=www.mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckelkamp|first1=Stephanie|title=Laughter Therapy is the New Meditation|url=http://time.com/84987/laughter-may-be-the-new-meditation/|website=Time.com|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin, R. A.|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=504–519|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottle service''' is the sale of [[liquor]] by the bottle in mostly American [[bar (establishment)|lounges and]] [[nightclub]]s.

The purchase of bottle service typically includes a [[table service|reserved table]] for the [[patron]]'s party and [[Drink mixer|mixers]] of the patron's choice. Bottle service can include the service of a [[Waiting staff|VIP host]], who will ensure that patrons have sufficient mixers and will often make drinks using the patrons' liquor bottle and mixers. The purchase of bottle service sometimes results in [[cover charge]] being waived for the purchaser's party and often allows patrons to bypass entrance lines. The tip is also often included in the price.

The cost of a bottle at such a lounge or club is usually significantly [[markup (business)|marked up]], often by 1000% or more, and can account for a significant portion of an establishment's revenue.&lt;ref name="milz"&gt;{{cite news |last= Milzoff |first= Rebecca |url= http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/22834/ |title= Can Clubland Survive Without Bottle Service? |work= [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date= October 16, 2006 |access-date= September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early forms of bottle service existed in World War II era [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://nymag.com/nightlife/features/17308/ |title= Bottle Service: A Brief History |date= June 18, 2006 |first= Brian |last= Niemietz |work= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; where unfinished bottles would be stored. In its modern form, an early example was in 1988 at the Paris nightclub Les Bains Douches, bottle service was introduced to deal with an excess of customer demand.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; An early, inexpensive form of bottle service ($90, compared with $6 drinks) was established at the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] in New York City in 1993 (by Jeffrey Jah and Mark Baker). The modern form of bottle service was pioneered in 1995 by  Michael Ault at Spy Bar and in 1996, Chaos ($175 for a bottle of [[Stolichnaya vodka]]),&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; with the goal of creating a "barrier to entry", rather than of increasing liquor sales.&lt;ref name="milz"/&gt;

The concept later spread to other American cities, notably [[Miami]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in the early 2000s.

==Criticism==
The cost of bottle service and the central position provided to purchasers of bottle service has led some critics to complain that bottle service is turning night clubs into [[elitist]] dens.&lt;ref name="criticism"&gt;{{cite news |last= Draoulec |first= Pascale |url= https://www.forbes.com/2007/11/02/vodka-clubs-bottle-forbeslife-cx_pl_1102bottleservice.html |title= Most Expensive Bottle Service |work= Forbes |date= February 7, 2011 |access-date= July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferential treatment for purchasers of bottle service may include stopping the regular dance music when an especially expensive bottle is purchased and, instead, playing a theme song, or removing patrons from a table to make way for another patron and their party that purchased bottle service.&lt;ref name="criticism"/&gt;

Redcoat is the name given to frontline staff at [[Butlins]] [[holiday camp]]s in the UK. A Redcoat has duties ranging from adult entertainer or children's entertainer to [[Stewardship|stewarding]].

==History==
[[File:Holiday Camp Gets Going Again- Everyday Life at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, Filey, Yorkshire, England, UK, 1945 D25923.jpg|left|thumb|Redcoats at Butlins [[Filey]] in 1947]]

The first Redcoat was [[Norman Bradford (Entertainer)|Norman Bradford]]. When Sir [[Billy Butlin]] opened his first Butlins in [[Skegness]] he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born.

The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed.&lt;ref name="Butlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories -Redcoats|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/other/redcoats.htm |publisher=Butlinsmemories.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

===Uniform===
[[File:2 Redcoats at Butlin's Minehead March 2011.jpg|thumb|Redcoats with former England football player George Cohen, March 2011]]
To make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red [[blazer]]s with white lapels and the '''Redcoat''' uniform was born. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry).

Over the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s).&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as [[Jeff Banks]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]] have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters "BHC" on (standing for "Butlins Holiday Camps") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform.

=== Recruitment and training ===
[[File:Female redcoat March 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A female Redcoat wearing pleated white skirt, March 2011]]

The Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only [[minimum wage]] and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case).&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{citation |title=Could you be a Redcoat?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2006/nov/03/couldyoubearedcoat|work=The Guardian |location=London|first=Ed|last=Ewing|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Redcoat Auditions|url=http://www.wearebutlins.com/redcoataudition/|publisher=WeArebutlins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Butlins Introduced the now defunct Butlins 'Academies of Excellence' to train Redcoats.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins loses hi-de-hi image|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/347557.stm|publisher=the BBC |date=19 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been replaced with a 6&amp;nbsp;week training course.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; There is also the option of a foundation degree in either musical theatre, or Technical Skills for the Arts and Leisure Industry&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoat degree at seaside resort|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7587695.stm|publisher=the BBC|date=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM1"&gt;{{citation|title=The boffins of Butlins: University offers degrees in the finer arts of being a holiday camp Redcoat|url=
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1160050/The-boffins-Butlins-University-offers-degrees-finer-arts-holiday-camp-Redcoat.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Laura|last=Clark|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training includes aspects of direction and production and time spent as a Butlins Redcoat counts toward membership of [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]].&lt;ref name="BBC4"&gt;{{citation|title=Bright future for Redcoats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2151442.stm|publisher=the BBC|first=Peter|last=Gould|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles===
Redcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort – Butlins even describe the role as "The Original Holiday Rep"&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1" /&gt; In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and ''[[X-Factor]]'' style game shows.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week.&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt;

==Similar staff==
{{further|Holiday camp#Frontline staff}}

Butlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at [[Pontins]] holiday camps,&lt;ref name="Pontins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories – Pontins|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/pontins/index.htm|publisher=butlinsmemories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point, Harry Warner decided [[Warner Leisure Hotels|Warners]]' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat.

==Media appearances==
The ITV series [[Redcoats (tv series)|''Redcoats'']] was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins [[Minehead]] and [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoats|url=http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm|publisher=Pilgrim Productions|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109054234/http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm#|archive-date=9 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
The BBC television series ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'', written by former Butlins employees [[Jimmy Perry]] (a Redcoat) and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] (summer show actor),&lt;ref name="DavidCroft1"&gt;{{citation |title=Croft and Perry|url=http://www.davidcroft.co.uk/Croft-Perry/|publisher=davidcroft.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show ''"Hi-de-Hi"'' originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded "Ho-de-ho".&lt;ref name="NotebookNews1"&gt;{{citation|title=Butlins at Clacton, a History of the Man and the Holiday Camp|url=http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html|publisher=notebooknews.co.uk|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102156/http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html#|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Citizen82"&gt;{{citation|title=Citizen 82 [Programme 2]|url=http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538|publisher=Central Television|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191247/http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538#|archive-date=13 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another BBC television series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', featured an episode entitled ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'', which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at [[Barry Island (holiday camp)|Barry Island]]). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras.&lt;ref name="DrWho1"&gt;{{citation |title=Delta and the Bannermen|url=http://www.mentalis.co.uk/sylvester-mccoy/delta-and-the-bannermen.aspx|publisher=mentalis.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable former Redcoats==
A number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; [[Stephen Mulhern]] notably performed on the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat,&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{citation |title=In-taxi with Stephen Mulhern|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1174331/In-taxi--Stephen-Mulhern.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Benji|last=Wilson|date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. [[Clinton Ford (singer)|Clinton Ford]], for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with "[[Old Shep]]" just after completing his final summer season at [[Penychain (holiday camp)|Pwllheli]]. However, prior to this in 1957 [[Russ Hamilton (singer)|Russ Hamilton]] recorded a number 2 hit in the UK "We Will Make Love" (held off the top spot by [[Elvis Presley]] and "[[All Shook Up]]"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song "Rainbow", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record "We Will Make Love" for the benefit of Butlins guests.&lt;ref name="Independant1"&gt;{{citation |title=Russ Hamilton: Liverpudlian singer-songwriter who had a hit in America years before the Beatles|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/russ-hamilton-liverpudlian-singersongwriter-who-had-a-hit-in-america-years-before-the-beatles-964176.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have gone on to find success building on the skills they learned as a Redcoat, such as [[Des O'Connor]], [[Jimmy Tarbuck]], and [[Michael Barrymore]].&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;{{citation |title=Famous faces launched at Butlins|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4886610.stm|publisher=The BBC|date=11 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role is an important part of the entertainment and tourism culture of the United Kingdom, and even today former Redcoats are regularly identified in the press and in books by this role even though it may only have been a small part of their career.

Other famous Redcoats include [[Ted Rogers (comedian)|Ted Rogers]], a comedian best known as the presenter of the variety/game show ''[[3-2-1]]'', and Northern Irish entertainer [[Jimmy Cricket]].

'''''Casefile True Crime Podcast''''', or simply '''''Casefile''''', is a weekly (sometimes fortnightly) [[true crime]] themed [[podcast]] that first aired in Australia in January 2016 and hosted by an Australian man who remains anonymous. The series deals with solved or [[Cold case|cold criminal cases]], often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur]] or the [[Snowtown murders]]), although notable crimes from the UK and the USA are increasingly featured,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/casefile-true-crime-podcast-becomes-global-hit-as-it-examines-uks-most-notorious-crimes-a3500716.html|title=Podcast becomes global hit as it examines UK's most notorious crimes|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cases from Canada, France, Guyana, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and Ukraine have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-australian-podcasts|title=The best Australian podcasts to listen to right now|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger and more-complex cases, such as [[Peter Sutcliffe|The Yorkshire Ripper]], [[Moors murders|The Moors Murders]], and [[Original Night Stalker|The East Area Rapist]], have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut, including Best of 2016 (iTunes).

== Production ==
The podcast first aired on 9 January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whatpods.com/ama/casefile/|title=AMA with the host of Casefile True Crime|work=WhatPods|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'', ''[[Dan Carlin|Hardcore History]]'', ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' and ''[[Making a Murderer|Making A Murderer]])'' at the time, and was encouraged by [[Joe Rogan]] to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to one source, the host remains anonymous because "he wants the stories, facts, and questions speak for themselves"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://shesaid.com/8-podcasts-binge-youre-obsessed-true-crime/|title=9 Podcasts To Binge If You’re Obsessed With True Crime|date=2018-02-14|work=SHE'SAID'|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "It makes the show about the stories and that's it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to another review, the podcast's:&lt;blockquote&gt;deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aux.avclub.com/our-favorite-podcasts-of-2016-1798255734|title=Our favorite podcasts of 2016|last=Bulnes|first=Rebecca|work=AUX|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In its current format, the 2018 ''Casefile'' team now consists of two researcher/writers, two composers, a designer, and the host/narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://casefilepodcast.com/team/|title=Team - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, “since about episode 7”, which led to episodes 1–6 being reworked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|national archives]] in [[Kew]] in 2017 to examine police files on [[Myra Hindley]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author [[Eileen Ormsby]]. 

Each case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as [http://casefilepodcast.com/case-53-east-area-rapist-1976-part-1/ in this example]. Warnings are regularly given at the start of podcasts due to the graphic content. It is available via numerous sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://audioboom.com/channel/casefile-true-crime|title=Casefile True Crime|website=audioboom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One episode, Case 55 (Simone Strobel, released 15 July 2017), has been removed due to legal issues, although general details of the case itself are publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2007/07/09/1973895.htm|title=Inquest hears Strobel boyfriend suspected in death|date=2007-07-09|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/police-study-luxury-beachside-life-of-man-whose-girlfriends-body-was-found-covered-in-palm-fronds/news-story/180de49076f1ca7c1e4249375d0a8dcb|title=Toby Moran’s life under scrutiny by police 12 years after his girlfriend’s mysterious death|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/casefile-true-crime-44949/episodes/case-55-simone-strobel-19346758|title=Case 55: Simone Strobel by Casefile True Crime on Podchaser|website=Podchaser|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Along with the recent rise in true crime podcasting, as seen in [[Serial (podcast)|Serial]] or [[S-Town]], the series has been reviewed positively by several sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/the-12-best-true-crime-podcasts-of-2018/|title=The 12 Best True Crime Podcasts Of 2018|work=LBC|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pickle.nine.com.au/2018/01/25/12/53/casefile-true-crime-podcast-qanda|title=Casefile: True Crime Podcast creator reveals story behind popular series|website=pickle.nine.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (22 July 2016):&lt;blockquote&gt;As ''Casefile'' points out in their tagline, fact is scarier than fiction. But what the podcast might really prove is that fact is ''even scarier'' when told in a thick Australian accent – especially when accompanied by ambient, pulsing noise from a trio of professional sound designers and musicians. In each weekly episode, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, the narrator... calmly tells a story of a devastating Australian crime. The podcast expertly covers murder and abduction, sometimes walking the listener through the criminal's trial, and other times discussing potential theories for a crime whose perpetrator was never caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/beyond-serial-10-true-crime-podcasts-you-need-to-follow-w429955/casefile-w429962|title=Beyond 'Serial': 10 True Crime Podcasts You Need to Follow|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[London Evening Standard|''Evening Standard'']] (28 March 2017):&lt;blockquote&gt;The Australian-made show, which launched in January last year, has regularly featured in the UK’s top 10 podcasts on iTunes in recent months. It also regularly reaches the top 50 in the US chart, rising as high as fourth last July. ... Its mini-series on Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe received 5.8 million downloads — the most for a single case since the launch. Its most popular single episode was on British tourist Peter Falconio ... [which] has more than 4.2 million downloads. A series covering the Moors Murders ... had more than a million downloads in four days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Download statistics by iTunesChart.net state that Casefile has charted in the top 100 in 4 regions, with peak ranking positions of the podcast including: Australia (1), Canada (9), United Kingdom (14), and United States (7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/artists/podcast/casefile-true-crime/podcasts/casefile-true-crime/|title=iTunesCharts.net: 'Casefile True Crime' by Casefile True Crime (International iTunes Chart Performance)|website=www.itunescharts.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the podcast has consistently been in the top 10 since May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/aus/artists/podcast/casefile-true-crime/podcasts/casefile-true-crime/|title=iTunesCharts.net: 'Casefile True Crime' by Casefile True Crime (Australian Podcasts iTunes Chart)|website=www.itunescharts.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has been criticized for a lack of transparency for its calculations, with no way to verify the accuracy what CelebrityNetWorth reports.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/style/richest-celebrities-in-hollywood.html|title=The Big Secret of Celebrity Wealth (Is That No One Knows Anything)|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most content is written by freelance writers, rather than journalists or computer scientists to analyze data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Activities==
CelebrityNetWorth creates web pages that list a celebrity's name, biography, and estimates of net worth and salary. The site calculates net worth by "applying a proprietary algorithm" based on publicly available information and using financial analysts to review such results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Warner has said of their estimates that "If we end up too far off, there is always some kind of backlash. There have been a handful cases when we’ve been proved to be off, and we’ve corrected it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=meredithqz |url=http://qz.com/364156/7-questions-with-the-ceo-who-gets-paid-to-know-what-every-celebrity-is-worth/ |title=Seven questions with the CEO who gets paid to know what every celebrity is worth |work=Quartz |date=March 18, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site provides news articles on financial transactions of celebrities such as the purchase of a home or lawsuits.&lt;ref name="cnw" /&gt;

CelebrityNetWorth creates lists ranking wealthy individuals based upon their wealth. In 2012 the company compiled a list of the 25 richest people in history, adjusted for inflation, naming [[Musa I of Mali|King Mansa Musa]] of the [[Mali Empire]] at the top of the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Who’s The Richest Person In History?| date=October 16, 2012| publisher=NPR| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/16/162993083/whos-the-richest-person-in-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=King Mansa Musa of Mali named richest person of all time| author=Erik Ortiz| date=October 18, 2012| publisher=New York Daily News| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/king-mansa-musa-named-richest-history-article-1.1186261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Mansa Musa of Mali Named World's Richest Man of All Time; Gates And Buffet Also Make List| date=October 17, 2012| publisher=Huffington Post| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/mansa-musa-worlds-richest-man-all-time_n_1973840.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Website names obscure 14th century African king the richest person in history| date=October 17, 2012| publisher=FOX News| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/17/website-names-obscure-14th-century-african-king-richest-person-in-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, it created a list of the world's richest DJs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The 30 Richest DJs In The World| author=Tom Breihan| date=June 12, 2012| publisher=StereoGum| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1062921/the-30-richest-djs-in-the-world/news/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a survey which named [[Ringo Starr]] as the world's richest drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ringo Starr Talks Paul, Meditation and Why He Loves L.A.| author=Steve Chagollan| date=January 28, 2014| publisher=Variety| accessdate=17 April 2015|url=https://variety.com/2014/music/news/ringo-starr-paul-mccartney-beatles-1201073353/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Google]] requested permission from Warner to include CelebrityNetWorth's data in its [[Knowledge Graph]]. Warner declined. However, in February 2016, Google began using information from its [[search engine indexing|search index]] of CelebrityNetWorth to display [[Google Searchology#Featured snippets|featured snippets]] with net worths at the top of their [[search engine results page|search result pages]] for relevant queries. The featured snippets were positioned above the search results, including results for CelebrityNetWorth. As a result, CelebrityNetWorth's [[web traffic]] declined by 65 percent from January 2016 to January 2017.&lt;ref name="the outline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeffries|first1=Adrianne|title=How Google eats a business whole|url=https://theoutline.com/post/1399/how-google-ate-celebritynetworth-com|website=The Outline|accessdate=12 Jul 2018|date=17 Apr 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Celebrity Page''''' (formerly '''''OK!TV''''', that is based on the [[OK!|magazine of the same name]]) is an American [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] entertainment news program.  The series is being co-produced by [[Meredith Corporation]] (formerly ''OK!'' US parent company [[American Media (publisher)|American Media]]), Unconventional Partners, and [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanmediainc.com/ok-magazine-launch-fall-2013-syndicated-tv-strip-ok-tv "OK! Magazine to Launch Fall 2013 Syndicated TV Strip OK! TV 2012"] press release from American Media (October 18, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on September 9, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/492067-Exclusive_Trifecta_s_OK_TV_a_Firm_Go_for_Fall_2013.php "Exclusive: Trifecta's 'OK!

On March 15, 2016, Trifecta announced that the series would be renamed ''Celebrity Page'' as a result of changing its partnership from [[American Media (publisher)|American Media's]] ''OK!'' magazine to [[Meredith Corporation]], which returned to producing content for syndication ten months after the [[Better (TV series)|''Better Show'']] was canceled. The change took effect on March 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/93128/meredith-partners-on-syndicated-magazine "Meredith Partners On Syndicated Magazine,"] from ''TVNewsCheck'', 3/15/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The series focuses on pop culture, celebrity news, gossip and lifestyle stories, some sourced through Meredith's television stations and magazine resources (though not those of the former [[Time Inc.]], including ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; Meredith completed their purchase of Time Inc. in January 2018, but those magazines have their own platforms and content agreements), along with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]''. The program is co-hosted by [[Sonia Isabelle]] in [[New York City|New York]] and Jaymes Vaughan in [[Los Angeles]].

'''''Child's Play''''' (also called '''''Chucky''''') is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] centered on a series of seven films created by [[Don Mancini]]. The films mainly focus on [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]), a notorious [[serial killer]] known as the "Lakeshore Strangler" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to [[Hell]]. The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.

The film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child’s Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since ''Bride of Chucky'', titles have no longer been released under the ''Child's Play'' brand name and now use ''Chucky'' and will continue to do so with future films.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/24/new-childs-play-sequel-curse-of-chucky-coming-to-dvd|title=New Child's Play sequel, Curse of Chucky, Coming to DVD|publisher=IGN|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' program as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taunting wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] who was a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] at the time and promoting ''Bride of Chucky''.

Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now dead Tiffany and attacks a detective.

In July 2018, ''Collider'' reported that a modern-day version of ''Child's Play'', a reboot, is in development at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] without the involvement of Mancini or Kirschner. Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of ''[[Polaroid (film)|Polaroid]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' fame, respectively). David Katzenberg and [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] will serve as producers. The plot will reportedly feature a group of kids, similar to ''[[Stranger Things (TV series)|Stranger Things]]'', and a hi-tech version of the Good Guy Doll. Production will begin in September, later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/childs-play-reboot-lars-klevberg-mgm-orion-it-producers/|title='Child's Play' Reboot In the Works at MGM From 'It' Producers|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
====Potential sequels====
In October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from ''Cult of Chucky''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailydead.com/interview-don-mancini-talks-cult-of-chucky-and-the-enduring-controversy-of-seed-of-chucky/|title=Interview: Don Mancini Talks CULT OF CHUCKY and the Enduring Controversy of SEED OF CHUCKY - Daily Dead|date=October 5, 2017|website=Dailydead.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, it was announced that a ''Child's Play'' television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/921339-childs-play-tv-series-coming-from-don-mancini-david-kirschner/amp|title=Child's Play TV series coming - Coming Soon|date=February 9, 2018|website=Coming soon.net|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' Mancini discussed the potential of a ''Child's Play'' film set on a train&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as ''Chucky on the Orient Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], tentatively referred to as ''Child’s Play on Elm Street''.&lt;ref name=bloody-disgusting.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3319172/childs-play-train-freddy-vs-chucky-don-mancini-dreams/|author=Brad Miska|title=‘Child’s Play’ On a Train? Freddy Vs. Chucky? Don Mancini Dreams…|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act," he explains. "I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up?&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as "cool and doable", confirming that the film would be titled ''Child’s Play on Elm Street'' and that he was currently in discussion with [[New Line Cinema]] about the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1693069/child-plays-writer-has-the-best-idea-for-a-chucky-crossover-with-freddy-krueger|title=Child Play's Writer Has The Best Idea For A Chucky Crossover With Freddy Krueger|date=17 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'', in which [[Freddy Krueger]]'s [[Freddy Krueger#Bladed Glove|bladed glove]] had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-chucky|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Chucky|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|date=26 October 2017|website=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV Series===
In February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled ''Child's Play: The TV Series'', is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"/&gt; By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray.&lt;ref name="TVSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3505915/don-mancini-teases-childs-play-tv-series-coming-soon|title=Don Mancini Teases "Child’s Play: The TV Series," Coming Soon!|first=John|last=Squires|date=22 June 2018|website=Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==
===''Chucky's Vacation Slides''===
On the home media [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release of ''Seed of Chucky'' in 2005, a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'' was included in the special features. The short, set during the events of ''Seed of Chucky'', follows Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen after having returned from a family vacation. The film implies that the events of ''Seed of Chucky'' take place over the course of 5–10 years. While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs. After a delivery man arrives with a pizza, Chucky leads him to his garage and kills him off-screen. Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd all reprise their roles from the films.

===''Chucky Invades''===
Leading up to the DVD release of ''Curse of Chucky'' in 2013, a series of short film videos were released. The clips showed Chucky interrupting the events of several other horror films. Brad Dourif and Edan Gross reprised their roles as Chucky and the Good Guy Doll, respectively.

*'''[[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky / Charles Lee Ray]]''' (played by [[Brad Dourif]])&lt;br&gt;The primary character in the fourth and fifth films and antagonist of the series. A merciless, wisecracking murderer whose soul gets stuck in a doll. He usually kills 'anyone' who gets in his way with a knife or any other weapon he finds and frames the hero of each film for them. Although being a deranged killer, he has a twisted sense of humor and often spouts comically vulgar insults. He is the only character to appear in all of the films in the franchise and appears in his human body in the first and, in the sixth movie, by flashbacks.
* '''[[Andy Barclay|Andrew William "Andy" Barclay]]''' (played by [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] and [[Justin Whalin]]) &lt;br&gt; The original protagonist. Pursued by Chucky so he could transfer his soul into the boy's body, but Andy always prevents Chucky from taking over his body, as well as successfully framing him for the murders. He appears in all three installments of the Child's Play trilogy and the sixth and seventh Chucky films. He is indirectly mentioned in ''Bride'' and ''Seed''.
*'''Karen Barclay''' (played by [[Catherine Hicks]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's mother, and later Mike's wife. She buys him a Good Guy doll for his birthday, unaware that the one she picked was possessed by a serial killer. Initially, she refuses to believe that Chucky was alive, but she soon finds out when he comes alive and tries to kill her. In ''Child's Play 2'', she is written out of the story when she was taken away to an insane asylum when no one believes her about the murderous doll. She appears only in the first film and is mentioned in the second, third and sixth films. In the sixth film, Karen talks to Andy over the phone, which reveals that she is now free from the asylum and plans to cook dinner for Andy's upcoming birthday. It is also strongly hinted that she has married Mike.
*'''Detective Mike Norris''' (played by [[Chris Sarandon]])&lt;br&gt;A detective investigating the murder of Andy's babysitter. He is also responsible for Chucky's death prompting him to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll. He initially refuses to believe the Barclays, but when Chucky tries to kill him, he becomes an ally to the family. In ''Child’s Play 2'', however, it is mildly implied that both Mike and Jack denied the ordeal to protect the reputation of the Chicago police department. Appears only in the first film, and is indirectly mentioned in the second and fourth films. He appears via archive footage in ''Curse of Chucky'' (namely, pictures on the internet). He was originally set to appear in ''Seed of Chucky'' but didn’t return due to scheduling conflicts.
*'''Kyle''' (played by [[Christine Elise]]) &lt;br&gt; Andy's teenage foster sister whom he ends up staying with. At first, she finds Andy to be a pain on her side but starts to back up his story about Chucky when she witnesses him trying to take his soul and later finds their foster mother murdered by Chucky. She then goes to find Andy and ends up saving his life in the Play Pals factory, as well as helping him destroy Chucky after he tries to kill him after the voodoo soul transfer spell goes awry. She appears in the second film and was written out of the series and was never seen again but was briefly mentioned in the third film when Andy re-encounters Chucky again. She was also briefly mentioned to have kept in contact with Andy in ''Curse'' as he kept a photo of her. Kyle later returned in ''Cult'' in the post-credits scene where actress [[Christine Elise]] reprised her role.
*'''Mr. Sullivan''' (played by [[Peter Haskell]])&lt;br&gt;The greedy and arrogant CEO of Good Guy Toys Inc., First appears in ''Child's Play 2'' upon learning of Andy's Good Guy Doll supposedly becoming possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, and tries to protect the company's reputation from angry stockholders. He also appears in ''Child’s Play 3'' when he moves Good Guy Toys forward with producing more dolls, however, he is killed by Chucky when he accesses Sullivan's office computer to find Andy in Military School. 
*'''Ronald Tyler''' (played by Jeremy Sylvers)&lt;br&gt;A young private boy who befriends Andy at the military school he is sent to after failing to cope with living at several foster homes. When he finds Chucky (who mailed himself to the same military school to go after Andy again), he decides to go after Tyler instead. At first, Tyler finds Chucky to be a nice guy but realizes the true colours of the doll's evil murderous ways once he attempts to transfer his soul into his body much like he attempted to do with Andy in the first two films. Appears in the third film, only to be written out of the series but was originally going to be killed off alongside Andy in the original draft to ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Kristen De Silva''' (played by [[Perrey Reeves]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's girlfriend at the military school he attends, ends up sticking up for him when Shelton and the other guys take a liking in bullying him. Appears only in the third film.
*'''Jack Santos''' (played by Tommy Swerdlow)&lt;br&gt;Mike's partner who was also investigating Andy's babysitter's death. In the beginning of the first film, he was mostly the cop who drove Mike's car to chase Eddie Caputo in his van. He was also one of the police officers that believed Andy was the killer. During the end, he tried to show Mike that Chucky wasn't alive, but was nearly killed by him and then he believed that the Barclays and Mike were telling the truth. He only appeared in the first film.
*'''[[Tiffany Valentine]]''' (played by [[Jennifer Tilly]])&lt;br&gt;Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend (and later wife/partner) who later gets her soul stuck in a doll like Chucky. She ultimately transfers her soul into actress Jennifer Tilly (her doppelganger and portrayer) in ''Seed'' after being fed up with her husband's intent to remain a doll. In ''Curse'', she is shown to be living a double life as both her regular self and Tilly. Appears in ''Bride'', ''Seed'', ''Curse'' and ''Cult''. 
*'''[[Jennifer Tilly]]''' (played by herself)&lt;br&gt;An exaggerated version of Tilly, herself, and Tiffany's idol. She first appears in ''Bride'' under her role as Tiffany. Appears in ''Seed'' as herself and the voice of Tiffany. Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Tilly's body. Also appears in Curse and Cult.
*'''[[Glen]]''' (played by [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and human form portrayed by Beans Balawi)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's original child and Glenda's twin brother. He was an orphan for the first five or six years of his life until he saw his parents on television. Glen is a good person, and he doesn't like violence and definitely does not like murder unlike his parents. Though Tiffany promised him that they will refrain from killing, Chucky tries to get Glen involved in the family business. He fears but still loves his dad due to the fact he killed him in a misunderstanding. He is the only living doll character not to be voiced by an [[Academy Award]] nominee. Appears in ''Bride'' (at the end as an infant) and ''Seed''. He does not appear in ''Curse'', nor is there any mention of him. 
*'''Glenda Ray''' (human form played by Kristina Hewitt)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's second child and the twin sister of Glen. She was originally Glen's alter ego for a brief moment, but was reborn as a human. Unlike Glen, she is violent, sadistic, and cruel. She is even more ruthless than her father, implying she possibly will take on the family business. Appears in ''Seed''.
*'''Jesse Miller''' (played by [[Nick Stabile]])&lt;br&gt;The former friend of Tiffany Ray and boyfriend of Jade. He was greatly disliked by Jade's uncle and believed to be responsible for his death until Chucky and Tiffany reveal themselves. In the end, Jade kills Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. He also appears in a ''Chucky'' comic continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Jade Kincaid''' (played by [[Katherine Heigl]])&lt;br&gt;The girlfriend of Jesse. Her uncle Warren is killed by Chucky and Tiffany early in the film. In the end, Jade shoots Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. She also appears with Jesse in another struggle with Chucky in a comic book continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.

==Music==
[[Joe Renzetti]] composed the first ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', followed by [[Graeme Revell]], who composed the soundtrack for ''[[Child's Play 2|Child’s Play 2]]'' and ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''. [[John D'Andrea]] and [[Cory Lerios]] wrote the score for ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'', while [[Pino Donaggio]] composed ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. [[Joseph LoDuca]] composed the score for ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and ''[[Cult of Chucky]]''.

==Controversies==

The following crimes have been associated with the ''Child’s Play'' films:

In December 1992 four people who [[Murder of Suzanne Capper#Torture|tortured and killed]] 16-year-old  Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the ''Child's Play'' movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (''Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)'' by 150 Volts, featuring [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from the movie ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadistic Killers: Profiles of pathological predators|first=Carol Anne|last=Davis|year=2007|publisher=Summersdale Publishing|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1-84024-581-3|authorlink=Carol Anne Davis|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] were said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]''. The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor [[James Ferman]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2605543.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Film censor Ferman dies|date=December 25, 2002|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including ''Chucky'' films, from the age of about six or seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/8235661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Boys' mother 'fed them cannabis'|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cleaners (serial killers)|Elena Lobacheva]], a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film ''Bride of Chucky'', which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-serial-killer-elena-lobacheva-bride-chucky-sexual-pleasure-killing-jailed-a8022326.html|title = ''Bride of Chucky'' serial killer who derived sexual pleasure from killing jailed|last = McIntyre|first = Niamh|publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''|date = 26 October 2017|website = independent.co.uk|accessdate = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==

===Innovation Publishing===
Beginning in 1992, [[Innovation Publishing]] released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 2''. It was later collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled ''Child’s Play: The Series'', ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 3''.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
In 2007, [[Devil's Due Publishing]] obtained the license to publish ''Child's Play'' comics and released a one-shot crossover with [[Hack/Slash]] titled ''Hack/Slash vs. Chucky'' which takes place after the events of the ''Seed of Chucky'' film. This was followed by a four-issue series called ''Chucky''. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.

==Video game==
{{main|Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash}}
Slimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''. The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet ''Child’s Play'' video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.

In the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child’s Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app was released on November 1, 2013.

==Halloween Horror Nights==
Since 1992, [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.

In 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''. ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.

In 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains [[Leatherface]], [[Freddy Krueger]], and [[Jason Voorhees]].

[[File:Card trick.jpg|thumb|Card trick. Upper left: "Pick a card, any card". Upper right: Back-palming a card. Bottom left: A "spring" flourish. Bottom right: A [[riffle shuffle]].]]
'''Close-up magic''' (also known as '''table magic''' or '''micromagic''') is [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] performed in an intimate setting usually no more than  ten feet (three metres)  from one's audience and is usually performed while sitting at a table.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark [1975] (1988). Mark Wilson's Complete Course In Magic. Courage Books. {{ISBN|0-89471-623-9}}. Card Magic, pp. 17-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Close-up magic can combine sleight-of-hand manipulations with [[card flourish]]es, and is called [[cardistry]]. 

[[Sleight-of-hand]], also known as prestidigitation ("quick fingers") or ''léger de main'' (Fr., "lightness of hand"), is the set of techniques used by a micromagician to manipulate objects such as cards and coins secretly.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Bill. Now You See It, Now You Don't!: Lessons in Sleight of Hand. Vintage. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Card flourish]]es are an example of skill rather than of illusion or deceit. It is the equivalent of [[juggling]] to a juggler.&lt;ref name="Hugard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hugard |first1=Jean |first2=Frederick |last2=Braué |first3=Paul |last3=Fleming |location=Mansfield Centre, CT |year=2015|title=The Royal Road to Card Magic |publisher=[[Dover Publications]], Martino Publishing |origyear=1999  |isbn=978-1614278603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two principal forms of micromagic are [[card tricks]] and [[coin tricks]] but any small item can be used for sleight-of-hand performances including dice, bottle caps, sugar cubes, sponge balls, pebbles, pens and [[cups and balls]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulves, Karl. Self-Working Table Magic: 97 Foolproof Tricks with Everyday Objects. Dover Publications. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for micromagicians to combine several of these objects in a single trick. Micromagician [[Johnny Ace Palmer]] produces baby chicks in his cups-and-balls routine.

Micromentalism is [[mentalism]] performed in an intimate session. This form of mentalism involves examples of [[telekinesis]], [[extrasensory perception]], [[precognition]] and [[telepathy]]. Most [[cold reading]] takes place in such an intimate session, as do most [[theatrical séance]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">The '''Cockney Alphabet''', also known as the '''Surrealist Alphabet''',&lt;ref&gt;Clapham &amp; Dwyer, A Surrealist Alphabet. (Available on the CD ''You have not to  laugh, don't you?'')&lt;/ref&gt; is a humorous recital of the alphabet, parodying the way the alphabet is taught to small children. The humour comes from forming unexpected words and phrases from the names of the various letters of the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Big-Questions/The-definitive-Cockney-Alphabet/2005/01/14/1105582700584.html |title=The definitive Cockney Alphabet |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=15 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=161119&amp;sectioncode=38 |work=Times Higher Education |title=Verbal frolics |date=13 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming a dog "Deefer" (as was common in the '50s{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}) is an example of the reverse of this phenomenon, based on interpreting the line ''D for dog'' in an everyday alphabet verse as "deefer dog". "Ceefer" as a name for a cat also appeared in Australia after the Second World War (C for cat) influenced by returning servicemen from England who had been exposed to the humour of the Cockney Alphabet.

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!-- 
WHAT??? There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===
[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]
{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger.

In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages.

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Dōjinshi===
{{Main|Dōjinshi}}

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003).

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media.

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cup-and-ball''' (or '''ball in a cup''') or '''ring and pin''' is a traditional children's toy. It is generally a wooden handle, to which a small ball is attached by a string, and which has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including '''boliche''' in Spain and '''balero''' in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the '''bilboquet'''. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called ''[[kendama]]'' is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity.

==History==

The game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then.
===Americas===

[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 067.JPG|thumbnail|Baleros at a [[tianguis]] in [[Uruapan]], [[Michoacan]], Mexico]]
[[File:Balero Demonstration showing a common method of landing the cup on the stick.webm|thumb|Balero demonstration in Mexico showing a common technique of landing the cup on the stick.]]

In North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Mohave people|Mohave]] variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Other variants include those played by the [[Inuit]] of what is now [[Labrador]], with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Ring and pin games in general were known as ''ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk'' in [[Inuit languages|Inuit dialects]].&lt;ref name="Blanchard1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendall Blanchard|title=The Anthropology of Sport: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGeLoS1pWA4C&amp;pg=PA148|date=1 January 1995|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-89789-330-5|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Bole Jeanne L Enfant Au Bilboquet.jpg|thumb|Jeanne Bôle's ''L'Enfant au Bilboquet'' (around 1880)]]

The cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Leibs&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports and Games of the Renaissance|author=Andrew Leibs|pages=84,147–148|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=0-313-32772-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played by King [[Henry III of France]] as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability.&lt;ref name="Freer1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Walker Freer|title=Henry III, King of France and Poland: His Court and Times. From Numerous Unpublished Sources, Including Ms. Documents in the Bibliotheque Impériale, and the Archives of France and Italy, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjTAAAAMAAJ|year=1888|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=10}} - ''"it is lamentable to read of the pitiful imbecility which could induce the king, the day following his indignant protest, to sally forth from the Louvre at the head of a disorderly troop, and to parade the streets of the capital playing with a cup-and-ball.''&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} such as the Marquis de Biévre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Strand Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67UvAAAAMAAJ|year=1907|publisher=G. Newnes|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had its golden age during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] — among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] mentions the game early in his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying "If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=The Confessions of J. J. Rousseau|publisher=Privately Printed for the Members of the Aldus Society  London, 1903|location=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iberian world===

The game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora, often known as '''boliche'''. The name varies across many countries — in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] it is called '''capirucho'''; in [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Mexico]] it is called '''balero'''; in [[Spain]] it is '''boliche'''; in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] it is called '''bilboquê'''; in [[Chile]] it is '''emboque'''; in [[Colombia]] it is called '''coca'''; and in [[Venezuela]] the game is called '''perinola'''.&lt;ref name="CIVILA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Civila|title=El balero|publisher=Open Publishing|language=Spanish|url=http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|accessdate=3 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914195227/http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|archivedate=14 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term ''zingo paya'' for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zingopaya.com/|title=The Zingo Paya Society|author=|date=|work=zingopaya.com|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline|date=February 2016}}

===England===

This game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as [[Jane Austen]] is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called ''Bilbo Catcher''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

There is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw40080/Charlotte-Mercier-Miss-playing-with-Cup-and-Ball|title=NPG D5676; Charlotte Mercier ('Miss playing with Cup and Ball') - Portrait - National Portrait Gallery|author=|date=|work=npg.org.uk|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other.

===Japan===

The game of [[kendama]] is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century.

===Germany===

In 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their [[Yo-yo|Yo-yos]] and [[Kendama|Kendamas]], began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy.

==Gameplay==

The main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging.

There are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as ''la simple'', ''la doble'', ''la vertical'', ''la mariquita''.

{{nihongo|'''''Devilman'''''|デビルマン|Debiruman|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Go Nagai]], which originally started as an [[anime]] adaptation of the concept of Nagai's previous manga series, ''[[Demon Lord Dante]]''. This 39-episode anime series was developed by [[Toei Animation]] in 1972, while Nagai began the ''Devilman'' as a manga in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'', barely a month before the anime series started. The series has since spawned numerous [[OVA]]s, manga, novels, and films.

Devilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. The most notable is [[Tomoharu Katsumata]]'s 1973 feature film ''[[Mazinger Z vs. Devilman]]'', which features Devilman teaming up with Nagai's titular robot to fight Dr. Hell.

==Plot==
Akira Fudo is a timid teenage boy who lives with Miki Makimura and her family after his parents died on a trip to the [[Arctic]]. One day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks for help when his archaeologist father died after uncovering a mask during an excavation of ancient Mayan ruins, confirming the existence of ancient apex predators that assimilate other lifeforms to evolve: [[demon]]s. The mask is revealed to be a fossilized demon skull that shows the wearer the world as it was many millennia ago when demons roam the Earth. Ryo's plan is to prevent the revival of demons: "To fight a demon, one must become a demon."

Ryo believes that people like Akira with a pure heart may be able to harness a demon's powers without being consumed and Akira agrees to help after they encounter demons in Ryo's house. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub in his father’s basement then picks a fight and draws blood to attract demonic attention. Demons begin to possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a powerful demon known as Amon – the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell – consumes Akira. But Akira manages to retain his sense of self while possessing some Amon's personality traits and power as he becomes known as Devilman. Throughout the series, Devilman has many battles with the demon hordes, encountering foes such as Amon's harpy-like lover Sirène, the water demon Geruma, and a large turtle-demon Jinmen who incorporates the souls of his victims into his shell.

Eventually, the demons start a [[world war]] with humanity which causes mass panic and paranoia across the planet with mankind turning on itself. Akira starts to gather other Devilmen like him to fight the demons, only to be betrayed by when Ryo exposed him to the public which resulted in Miki's parents arrested by the government while she and her brother were violently murdered by a mob which Akira slaughtered in retribution. It was then that Ryo reveals himself as the reincarnation of the fallen angel [[Satan]], having unconsciously orchestrated his true plan while exploiting humanity's flaws and fell in love with Akira as he arranged his transition into Devilman. With no one left to protect, Akira ends his friendship with Satan as they eventually settle things in an epic battle lasting twenty years after humanity is extinct.

During the final battle, Satan reveals to Akira that the demons were unintentionally created by God and that he defied the order to kill them out of deeming that they have a right to live. Satan convinced the demons to enter a state of [[hibernation]] in the ice to conserve their strength for the final battle with God, awakening to find Earth ravaged by humanity which he resolved to exterminate first. It was then that Satan realizes his actions made him and the demons were no better than God, learning too late that he already killed Akira when asking for his forgiveness. The series ends with the Devilman army defeated, which Satan weeping for the loss off his dearest love as an army of [[angel]]s appear in the distance to wipe out the remains of Satan's army.

==Production==
''Devilman'' evolved from Go Nagai's previous manga, ''[[Demon Lord Dante]]'', after [[Toei Animation]] approached Nagai about turning ''Dante'' into a television series. The producers wanted certain elements toned down, and a more human-like anti-hero created. ''Devilman'' was born as a result of this.&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devilman Revelations|url=http://devilworld.org/revelations.html |publisher=devilworld.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620081843/http://devilworld.org/revelations.html |archivedate = 2006-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Go Nagai worked on the anime's scenario along with renowned screenwriter and science-fiction novelist [[Masaki Tsuji]], who wrote the scripts for 35 of the TV series' 39 episodes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Along with the television series, ''Devilman'' was also produced as a serialized manga in ''[[Shōnen Magazine]]'' beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name="Go Nagai works list 1971-1975 - ebookjapan"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ebookjapan.jp/ebj/nagaigo/works_02.asp|title=Go Nagai works list 1971–1975| accessdate=2009-08-02|work=Nagai Go Special Corner|publisher=eBOOK Initiative Japan| location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Go Nagai designed the manga to be more horror-like and mature than the anime version.&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"/&gt; 

Nagai designed ''Devilman'' as an anti-war work; the fusion of humans and demons is an analogy for the draft, and Miki's violent death parallels the death of peace. "There is no justice in war, any war," wrote Nagai, "nor is there any justification for human beings killing one another. ''Devilman'' carries a message of warning, as we step toward a bright future."&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"/&gt;

===Manga===
{{Main article|List of Devilman chapters}}
The manga was originally published by Kodansha from {{start date|1972|06|11}} to {{end date|1973|06|24}} in ''[[Shōnen Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Go Nagai works list 1971-1975 - ebookjapan" /&gt; The series has been published in ''[[tankōbon]]'' format several times, most of them by [[Kodansha]]. Starting with the 1987 publishing, most Kodansha editions include ''Shin Devilman'', which originally was not meant to be included in the canon of the original series, as a part of the volumes.&lt;ref name="Shin Devilman - d/visual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-world.jp/dv/gonagai.php?action=devilman2 |title=Shin Debiruman – Devilman 2 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |work=Nagai Go Special Corner |publisher=d/visual |location=Japan |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222065346/http://www.d-world.jp/dv/gonagai.php?action=devilman2 |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This source has not been archived by Wayback Machine prior to 2011--&gt; The manga has been translated into English in a series of five bilingual manga volumes published by Kodansha.&lt;ref name="Devilman (Kodansha bilingual comics) - Webcat Plus"&gt;{{cite web|title       = Devilman (Kodansha bilingual comics)|url=http://webcatplus-equal.nii.ac.jp/libportal/DocDetail?txt_docid=NCID%3ABA60451114|publisher=National Institute of Informatics|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manga has also been published along with ''[[Cutie Honey]]'' in the magazine {{nihongo|''Gekkan Kanzenban Devilman x Cutie Honey''|月刊完全版デビルマン×キューティーハニー|gekkan kanzenban debiruman x kyūteī hanī}} published by JIVE during 2004&lt;ref name="Gekkan Kanzenban Devilman x Cutie Honey Vol.1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jive-ltd.co.jp/catalog/devilhoney01.html|title=Gekkan Kanzenban Devilman x Cutie Honey Vol.1|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher=JIVE|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to take advantage of the release of the live-action films of both series.

{{nihongo|''[[Shin Devilman]]''|新デビルマン|Shin Debiruman}} was originally published in [[Kodansha]]'s ''Shōnen Magazine Special'' in {{start date|1979|05|25}}, {{start date|1980|01|25}}, {{start date|1980|09|15}}, {{start date|1981|03|06}} and {{start date|1981|05|08}}. All chapters were drawn by Go Nagai, but the first chapter was written in collaboration with [[Masaki Tsuji]], while chapters two and three were written by [[Hiroshi Koenji]].&lt;ref name="Go Nagai works list 1976-1980 - ebookjapan"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ebookjapan.jp/ebj/nagaigo/works_03.asp|title=Go Nagai works list 1976–1980| accessdate=2009-08-04|work=Nagai Go Special Corner|publisher=eBOOK Initiative Japan| location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the chapters were done by Nagai. The manga is sometimes known as ''Devilman 2'' and ''Neo Devilman''.&lt;ref name="Shin Devilman - d/visual" /&gt;

A one-shot, which is not originally part of ''Shin Devilman'', but that has always been compiled along with the series in ''tankōbon'', was published in the magazine ''Variety'' by [[Kadokawa Shoten]].&lt;ref name="Go Nagai works list 1976-1980 - ebookjapan" /&gt; This 16-page story does not have any text and it presents the moments of Akira after the death of Miki in the original series, but before the battle with Satan, as he buries the remains of Miki and encounters Ryo.

[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] announced the publication of the original manga for 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-05-19/seven-seas-licenses-devilman-devilman-vs-hades-manga/.116336|title=Seven Seas Licenses Devilman, Devilman Vs.

Both were directed by Umanosuke Iida (credited under his birth name, Tsutomu Iida) and were closely developed in conjunction with Nagai himself. The OVAs' plot revolves around Akira's transformation into Devilman up until his battle with Sirène. Besides a few minor alterations, the OVAs are faithful to the original manga.  Both OVAs were released on [[Laserdisc]] and on a single DVD by Bandai Visual in {{Start date|2003|03|28}}.&lt;ref name="Devilman OVA Collection - bandaivisual.co.jp "&gt;{{cite web|url= http://product.bandaivisual.co.jp/web_service/shop_product_info.asp?item_no=BCBA-1570|title       = Devilman OVA Collection (Digital Beat – Work detail)|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher= Bandai Visual|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two OVAs were also the only ''Devilman'' anime to have been commercially released in the United States (by [[Manga Entertainment]]) prior to 2014. The DVD release included only the English-dubbed version (the original Japanese version was previously released on VHS in 1995 by L.A. Hero and Dark Image Entertainment).

In 2000, ''[[Amon: The Darkside of The Devilman|Amon: Apocalypse of Devilman]]'' was released as a pay-per-view event in Japan and was later released on video and DVD.  It covers the period between the humans becoming aware of demons and the semi-final battle between Devilman and Amon.  The battle between Devilman and Satan does not occur in this OVA.

In 2015, ''[[Cyborg 009 VS Devilman]]'' was released. The 3-episode OVA features Devilman battling the cast of [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s ''[[Cyborg 009]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-07-13/cyborg-009-vs-devilman-anime-reveals-main-devilman-cast/.90381 |title=Cyborg 009 Vs.

===Films===
''[[Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman]]'' is a crossover animated film between ''Devilman'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' produced by Toei and released in {{start date|1973|07|18}}. The movie features alternative versions of the events from both series, and is therefore not canonical to either one.

In {{start date|2004|10|09}}, a live-action [[tokusatsu]] film directed by [[Hiroyuki Nasu]] was theatrically released in Japan.&lt;ref name="Devilman film - allcinema"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=319020|title=Devilman film|accessdate=2010-10-30|publisher=AllCinema|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred Hisato Izaki as Devilman, Yūsuke Izaki as Ryo Asuka and Ayana Sakai as Miki Makimura.

===In other media===
Three novels have been released. The first one {{nihongo|''Shin Devilman''|真・デビルマン|Shin Debiruman}} was written by Go Nagai's brother [[Yasutaka Nagai]] with illustrations by Go. It was originally published in 1981 by [[Asahi Sonorama]] in four books.&lt;ref name="Devilman variation novels - Viva! Dynamic"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~wx5h-ktb/gofo/devarie_novel.html|title=Devilman variation novels|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher=Viva! Dynamic|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not related to the manga ''Shin Devilman'', from which some chapters were also written by Yasutaka.  With the release of the first OVA, in 1987 a single volume novel based on it was released by Kodansha titled {{nihongo|''Shin Video Shosetsu – Devilman: Tanjo Hen''|新ビデオ小説 デビルマン 誕生編|shin bideo shousetsu debiruman tanjou hen}}.  It was also written by Yasutaka Nagai, but it had illustrations by the OVA's main designer, Kazuo Komatsubara.  In 1999 a second novelization of 4 volumes titled {{nihongo|''Devilman: The Novel''|デビルマン The Novel}} was published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] and once again written by Yasutaka and illustrated by Go.&lt;ref name="Devilman variation novels - Viva! Dynamic" /&gt; All three series of novels are unrelated to each other even though all were written by Yasutaka Nagai.

A video game based on ''Devilman'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] by [[Namco]] on {{start date|1989|04|25}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/devilman/index.html |title=Devilman for NES |publisher=GAMESPOT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bandai]] also released a game based on ''Devilman'' for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Windows 98]] on {{start date|2000|04|13}}.&lt;ref name="Devilman Release Information for PlayStation - GameFAQs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/data/577175.html| title=Devilman Release Information for PlayStation – GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-07-31| publisher=CBS Interactive|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with several of Nagai's other creations, Devilman appeared in the Japanese [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] game {{nihongo|''CB Chara Wars: Ushinawareta Gag''|CBキャラウォーズ 笑われたギャーグ|cb kyarauōzu warawa reta gyāgu}}.&lt;ref name="CB Chara Wars Release Information for SNES - GameFAQs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/data/581962.html|title=CB Chara Wars Release Information for SNES – GameFAQs|accessdate =2009-07-31|publisher=CBS Interactive|location   =USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. Miki is the first female protagonist of the 1974 manga ''[[Oira Sukeban]]'', and Akira has appeared in various incarnations of ''[[Cutie Honey]]'', most notably the 1994 OVA ''[[New Cutie Honey]]''. Miki and Ryo Asuka also appear as dogs (with dog-like bodies and human heads) in the ''[[Violence Jack]]'' manga. In 1997, Nagai created ''[[Devil Lady]]'', based on his idea of if the main character was a woman. The ''Devil Lady'' series contains its own original story that stands out from the ''Devilman'' series. Fudo's silhouette briefly appears in the opening credits of ''Devil Lady''. The cast of ''Devilman'' also crossed over with characters from ''Mazinger Z'' and ''Violence Jack'' in the 1991 OVA ''[[CB Chara Nagai Go World]]''. This release featured the familiar characters in comical and lighthearted antics in [[super deformed]] forms. In this series, it is revealed that Violence Jack is a future version of Akira Fudo. It is also revealed that Miki is an [[otaku]] and that she knew of Akira's identity as Devilman due to reading the manga offscreen.

Go Nagai created the manga ''Devilman Saga'' (デビルマンサーガ) in 2014 which is said to conclude the Devilman trilogy. It is published in Shogakukan's ''Big Comic''.The story takes place in the year 2025, a [[roboticist]] named Fudou Yuuki joins a project involving a large mural depicting humanity's true past as well as the ancient but advanced technology found in Antarctica.

==Reception==
The manga has sold over 50 million copies as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hobby.dengeki.com/news/355688/|script-title=ja:永井豪原作の漫画『デビルマン』を湯浅監督が新作アニメとして映像化！ティザービジュアル＆特報解禁!! | date=March 16, 2017 |publisher=[[Dengeki]]|language=Japanese |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The storyline in ''Devilman'' made it stand apart from other manga of the time. However, its controversial violence made it a major target of protest for the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menofcomics.com/anime/masaaki-yuasas-devilman-project-officially-titled-devilman-crybaby-premieres-netflix-2018/|title=Masaaki Yuasa's Devilman project is officially titled Devilman Crybaby|last=|first=|date=|website=Men of Comics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go Nagai is said to have been highly shocked that his giant-robot work ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', which was on Japanese TV at the same time as ''Devilman'' and which he originally did not take very seriously, surpassed ''Devilman'' in popularity. The reason was that he had worked especially hard on ''Devilman'' and only made ''Mazinger'' as a way to blow off steam.

Devilman was ranked fifth in Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that "Shonen manga developed a dark tone with Devilman's graphic violence, casual blasphemy, and theme of using evil itself to fight evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/10-iconic-anime-heroes_article_119883.html |title=10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes |last=Zoth |first=Thomas |date=January 12, 2010 |publisher=Mania Entertainment |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017063118/http://www.mania.com/10-iconic-anime-heroes_article_119883.html |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A character designer from [[SNK]] admitted that ''Devilman'' was an influence in designing [[Kyo Kusanagi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shmuplations.com/kof94/|title=King of Fighters ’94 – Developer Interview|publisher=Shmuplations|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Huff of The Anime Review Notes "a couple of enjoyable bits" in the OVA adaptation, yet ultimately recommends Vampire Hunter D instead "if you want to see a splatterfest of grotesque monsters getting all gooey and split in two", &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanimereview.com/reviews/devilman.html |title=Devilman |publisher=''[[TheAnimeReview]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements of [[The Anime Encyclopedia]] said that the series was brought down by "the messy confluence of Japanese and European mythology". Though comments about the series and statements making incorrect claims on the series, make it seem as if they never read it.&lt;ref&gt;The Anime Encyclopedia, Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disney Fairies''''' is a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] created in 2005. The franchise is built around the character of [[Tinker Bell]] from [[Walt Disney]]'s 1953 animated film ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', subsequently adopted as a [[mascot]] for the company. In addition to the fictional [[fairy]] character created by [[J. M. Barrie]], the franchise introduces many new characters, and expands substantially upon the limited information the author gave about the fairies and their home of [[Never Land]]. The characters are referred to within stories as "Never Land fairies". The franchise includes children's books and other merchandise, a web site, and the computer-animated [[Tinker Bell (film series)|''Tinker Bell'' film series]], featuring the character and several of the Disney fairies as supporting and recurring characters.

==Setting==
In Barrie's 1902 novel ''[[The Little White Bird]]'', in which he introduced the mythos of Peter Pan and the fairies, he wrote, "When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hollindale, Peter |author2=Barrie, J. M. |title=Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, and; Peter and Wendy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-283929-9 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Disney Fairies'' are based on a similar idea: every time a newborn baby laughs for the first time, that laugh travels out into the world, and those that make their way to Neverland turn into a Never fairy.

The fairies generally reside in the Home Tree, a towering, massive tree located in the very heart of Pixie Hollow in Neverland. Various groups of fairies work and live nearby as well. Most of the fairy characters are young and female, but older, taller, and male fairy characters are also included. The males are sometimes referred to as "sparrow men", though the term "fairies" is used to refer to both female and male fairy characters.

===Characters in the books===
There are several key characters that are not Never Fairies.

* '''Brother Dove''': A dove who carries the wingless water fairy Rani on his back when she wishes to fly. He may be one of Mother Dove's chicks since he can talk to all the fairies, not just animal talents.
* '''Fufalla''': A wand fairy who loves to play pranks and practical jokes on others.
* '''Kyto''': A dragon who has been caged for as long as anyone can remember. He is very sneaky and once, when Mother Dove's egg broke, he had to make it whole again with a trade of Captain Hook's double cigar holder, the golden hawk's feather, a mermaid's comb, and Rani's wings.
* '''Mother Dove''': A dove who has an egg that is in Pixie Hollow that was broken but restored by Rani, Vidia, and Prilla in ''Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg''. Mother Dove helps the people in Neverland stay young and is mentioned in every book.
* '''Tutupia''': The queen of the Great Wanded fairies (or Great Wandies). Great-wand fairies are about seven feet tall and have mystical wands or scepters that possess many magical properties.

Some of Tink's book-only best friends who also may appear in a crossover special with the Fairies in the movies and with other shows:

* '''Beck''': An animal-talent fairy
* '''Bess''': An art-talent fairy
* '''Fira''': A light-talent fairy
* '''Lily''': A garden/earth-talent fairy
* '''Prilla''': A travel-talent fairy, introduced in Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg. The only fairy of her talent, Prilla can travel between Neverland and the human world. This allows her to encourage children to clap and save fairies' lives. All the other talents treat her as an honorary member, and she is sometimes considered odd for her tendency to use human phrases over fairy.
* '''Rani''': A water fairy. Rani plays a major role in Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg, along with Prilla and Vidia. To save Mother Dove, the other fairies, and Neverland, the fairies must retrieve a mermaid's comb. However, fairies cannot swim because their wings absorb water and drag them down. To obtain the comb, Rani cuts off her wings, becoming the only fairy who cannot fly, but also the only fairy that can swim.

Fawn, Iridessa, Queen Clarion, Rosetta, Silvermist, Sweetpea, Terence, and Vidia were from the books, as well. They are the only fairies from the books to appear in the movies. Sweetpea only appears in ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'' (the sixth movie).

* '''Nettle''': A fairy whose magical talent is caterpillar-shearing. She, Prilla, and Myka are friends.

* '''Wisp''': a new fast-flying-talent fairy who is almost as fast as Vidia, through training. She and Vidia race through the Hollow and later engage in a friendly rivalry.
* '''Zuzu''': A tinker-talent fairy who is very loyal to her job.

There is a set of key Never Mermaids:

At the opening of the 2005 [[Bologna Children's Book Fair|Bologna International Children's Book Fair]], the Walt Disney Company revealed its plan to introduce a children’s illustrated novel for girls 6–10 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID10023300.asp |title=LPWire: Disney Publishing Sprinkles Fairy Dust on New Children's Book - LaughingPlace.com: Disney World, Disneyland and More |publisher=LaughingPlace.com |date=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Disney Fairies debuted September 2005, when [[Disney Publishing Worldwide]] unveiled the novel ''Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg'', written by [[Newbery Honor]]-winning author [[Gail Carson Levine]] with a US$1 million marketing and publicity campaign and a virtual world.&lt;ref name="pw0"/&gt; It was released in 45 countries and 32 languages and became a [[New York Times bestseller]] and has already sold over 1 million copies worldwide.

The story begins in Fairy Haven/Pixie Hollow, located in the heart of Neverland. Prilla, who is a brand-new fairy, born of a baby's laugh, arrives in Neverland and discovers that she has no talent for any of the fairy avocations. Tinker Bell takes Prilla to see Mother Dove, but before the wise bird can advise Prilla, Neverland is shaken by a terrible [[hurricane]]. Mother Dove is thrown off her nest, and her precious egg, which holds all the secrets of Neverland, is shattered. Immediately, all those who live in Neverland begin to age. The island's only hope is for some brave fairies to take the egg pieces to Kyto the [[dragon]] and ask him to restore it with his fiery breath.

The book was followed in 2007 by a sequel, entitled ''Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand''. Another sequel, ''Fairies and the Quest for Neverland'', was released in 2010.

In the Year of a Million Dreams celebration, book stores released a form submitting a fairy character. The winner is said to be put in his/her own fairy's book.

In June 2006, [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]] Magazines launched a new monthly magazine for girls for 5–9 years old, produced by The Walt Disney Company Italia, S.p.A. and published in Italy a couple of months prior to the Egmont translations.

==Merchandising==
In addition to the Published work, The Walt Disney Company provides support for the Disney Fairies across all business units. The campaign includes [http://www.disneyfairies.com The Disney Fairies Website], where visitors can explore and discover information about the Disney Fairies. The website allows users to learn about the fairies, create a fairy, visit the Pixie Hollow, and explore related merchandise.

Disney Consumer Products have also produced a line of dolls and role play assortments. The first Disney Fairies Products were a series of 10-inch dolls, which were a Disney store exclusive in January 2006.&lt;ref name="jimhillmedia2006"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Hill |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2006/05/29/2616.aspx?Ajax_CallBack=true&amp;Ajax_CallBack=true |title="Disney Fairies" franchise gets ready to take flight |publisher=Jimhillmedia.com |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, [[Playmates Toys Inc]] teamed up with Disney in October 2005 to design and produce a line of toys for the Disney Fairies, which will include 3.5" small dolls, 8" fashion dolls, playsets &amp; activity sets with DVDs and collectible story cards. ''Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg'' was the inspiration for the line of toys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://licensing.disney.com/Login/displayContent.do?layout=pressReleaseDetail&amp;contentId=293471&amp;returnLayout=pressReleaseArchives&amp;year=2005&amp;articleSort=date ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027015538/https://licensing.disney.com/Login/displayContent.do?layout=pressReleaseDetail&amp;contentId=293471&amp;returnLayout=pressReleaseArchives&amp;year=2005&amp;articleSort=date |date=October 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney Consumer Products launched a wide variety of Disney Fairies branded items, consisting of everything from apparel to stationery.&lt;ref name="jimhillmedia2006"/&gt;

A series of ten postage stamps were issued by [[Japan Post]] in 2006. Each stamp has a face value of 80 JPY, and they were distributed in a hardcover case, including some information about the Fairies. The stamps could be ordered at some post offices in Japan, and were for domestic addresses.

[[File:Disneyland Pixie Hollow silly Tinker Bell.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Tinker Bell makes a face at Pixie Hollow.]]
In October 2008, two ''Pixie Hollow'' locations opened at Disney Parks. One opened at [[Disneyland]] near the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Matterhorn]] in the area where [[Ariel's Grotto]] was formerly located, and the other at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Mickey's Toontown Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At these ''Pixie Hollow'' locations, guests have the opportunity to meet and greet Tinker Bell and other fairies, Silvermist, Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Terence, Vidia, and arriving in October 2012, Periwinkle, from the franchise, as well as dine with them.

The Magic Kingdom location closed in February 2011 as part of the ongoing Fantasyland expansion. A larger ''Pixie Hollow'' area was included in the original plans for the expansion, but they have since been abandoned. On July 28, 2011, Tinkerbell and her fairy friends returned to the Magic Kingdom in "Tinkerbell's Magical Nook", located at the Adventureland Veranda. But in 2014, it was closed, and Tinker Bell has moved to Town Square Theater where she can greet guests alone.

'''''Pixie Hollow''''' was an [[MMOG]] created by [[The Walt Disney Company]] and released September 8, 2008.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Warren |last=Buckleitner |title=A Charm to Take Little Pixies Off the Web and Home to Play |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/technology/personaltech/23click.html?ref=personaltech |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was free to play online, however a subscription was needed to have access to things for members only. The website was based partly on the Disney fairy books written by [[Gail Carson Levine]]. Free-members could create a female Fairy or male Sparrow Man [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] who each came with a small selection of furnishings to decorate a virtual room. Players were able to interact with others and have access to both 'speed' chat with pre-selected phrases and full chat where they are able to type their own messages. They could also play various "Talent Games," or fairy themed mini-games, found in the various meadows and forests of Pixie Hollow. The game used organic materials as a virtual currency for players to shop. Players could also play games and visit places to earn badges that they could see in their "leaf journal," which also served as a handbook and inventory. Players could purchase a monthly, semi-annual or annual membership. The membership included: Clothing, furniture, access to the ballroom, and a hair salon with spa.

You could also purchase Pixie Diamonds. Members were granted an allowance of Pixie Diamonds, (once a month.) People who were not members were able to buy clothing, but they had to use Pixie Diamonds.

Though the website was geared towards young girls, on April 22, 2010, the game introduced a male character named Slate; he was referred to as a "Sparrow Man" rather than a male fairy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disneyonlineworlds.com/index.php/Never_News_22_April_2010 |title=Never News 22 April 2010 - Disneys Online Worlds Guide (Wiki) |publisher=Disneyonlineworlds.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2013, it was announced that Pixie Hollow would be closing on September 19, 2013. All the fairies were given unlimited access to the world until the closing date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/fairies/pixie-hollow/closing/ |title=Pixie Hollow FAQ &amp;#124; Disney Fairies |publisher=Disney.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916082429/http://disney.go.com/fairies/pixie-hollow/closing/ |archivedate=2013-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television appearances==
''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'' has featured Tink in "Jake's Never Land Rescue", "Battle for the Book" and "Jake's Awesome Surprise".

To date, two of the characters from the Disney Fairies franchise have appeared in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. Tinker Bell appears as a recurring character played by [[Rose McIver]] and debuts in the [[Quite a Common Fairy|third episode of Season Three]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">'''Elegiac comedy''' was a [[genre]] of [[medieval Latin]] [[Latin literature|literature]]—or [[Medieval theatre|drama]]—which survives as a collection of about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the [[Loire Valley]]). Though commonly identified in [[manuscript]]s as ''comoedia'', modern scholars often reject their status as [[comedy]]. Unlike [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] comedy, they were written in [[elegiac couplet]]s. Denying their true comedic nature, [[Edmond Faral]] called them '''Latin ''fabliaux''''', after the later [[Old French]] ''[[fabliaux]]'', and [[Ian Thomson (antiquary)|Ian Thomson]] labelled them '''Latin comic tales'''. Other scholars have invented terms like '''verse tales''', '''rhymed monologues''', '''epic comedies''', and '''Horatian comedies''' to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Roy (1974), 258 n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin "comedies", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the ''fabliaux'' but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], student [[juvenilia]], didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.

Some elegiac comedies were adapted into [[vernacular]] language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as [[Boccaccio]], [[Chaucer]], and [[John Gower|Gower]]. The poem ''Pamphilus'' has [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Old French]] versions.

==Style==
These comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; [[Lyric poetry|lyric complaints]] only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the [[New comedy|Greek "new comedy"]] practised by [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], but the greatest influence on them was [[Ovid]]. His ''[[Ars amatoria]]'', ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', and ''[[Heroides]]'' were highly influential. [[Plautus]], though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] debates concerning the nature of [[universals]] and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.

The elegiac dramatists delight in "showing off" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their "fools" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. [[Parody]] is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its [[Satire|satiric]] effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.

==Dramatic features==
The comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.

The elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that "no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs." A similar opinion is that the comedies are [[rhetoric]]al exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. [[John of Garland]] wrote "all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true." Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. [[Arnulf of Orléans (commentator)|Arnulf of Orléans]], one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.

'''{{Lang|fr|Entr'acte}}''' (or ''{{lang|fr|'''entracte'''}}'' {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃tʁakt}};&lt;ref&gt;Since 1932–35 the [[Académie française|French Academy]] recommends this spelling, with no apostrophe, so historical uses (such as the 1924 [[René Clair]] [[Entr'acte (film)|film title]]) are still spelled ''Entr&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;acte''.&lt;/ref&gt; German: ''{{Lang|de|Zwischenspiel}}'' and ''{{Lang|de|Zwischenakt}}'', Italian: ''[[intermezzo]]'', Spanish: ''{{Lang|es|intermedio}}'') means "between the acts". It can mean a pause between two parts of a stage production, synonymous to an [[intermission]] (this is nowadays the more common meaning in French), but it more often (in English) indicates a piece of music performed between acts of a theatrical production.

In the case of stage musicals, the ''entr'acte'' serves as the [[overture]] of act 2 (and sometimes acts 3 and 4, as in ''[[Carmen]]''). In films that were meant to be shown with an intermission, there was frequently a specially recorded ''entr'acte'' on the soundtrack between the first and second half of the film, although this practice has died out in recent years.

==Origin==
Originally ''entr'actes'' resulted from stage curtains being closed for set or costume changes: to fill time as not to halt the dramatic action, to make a transition from the mood of one act to the next, or to prevent the public from becoming restless. In front of the closed curtains, the action could be continued during these ''entr'actes'', albeit involving only players with no scenery other than the curtain, and a minimum of [[theatrical property|props]].

An ''entr'acte'' can take the action from one part of a large-scale drama to the next by completing the missing links.  The Spanish [[Sainete]] often performed a similar function.

==The role of music==
In traditional theatre, [[incidental music]] could also bridge the 'closed curtain' periods: [[ballet]], [[opera]] and [[drama]] each have a rich tradition of such musical interludes. The literal meaning of the German word, ''{{Lang|de|Verwandlungsmusik}}'' refers to its original function – "change music". Eventually, ''entr'actes'' (or ''intermezzi'') would develop into a separate genre of short theatrical realizations (often with a plot completely independent from the main piece), that could be produced with a minimum of requisites during intermissions of other elaborate theatre pieces. These later ''entr'actes'' were distinctly intended to ''break'' the action or mood with something different, such as comedy or dance. Such pieces also allowed the chief players of the main piece to have a break. Eventually the idea of being an insert into a greater whole became looser: ''interlude'' sometimes has no other connotation than a "short play".

==Other dramatic devices==
When the insert was intended only to shift the mood before returning to the main action, without a change of scene being necessary, authors could revert to a "[[play within a play]]" technique, or have some accidental guests in a ballroom perform a dance, etc. In this case the insert is a ''[[divertimento]]'' (the term is Italian; the French ''[[divertissement]]'' is also used) rather than an ''entr'acte''.

In the French opera tradition of the end of the 17th century and early 18th century ([[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], for example) such ''divertissements'' would become compulsory in the form of an inserted ballet passage, a tradition that continued until well into the 19th century. This was eventually parodied by [[Jacques Offenbach]]: for example, the [[cancan]] ending ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''.

By the middle of the 18th century, a ''divertimento'' had become a separate genre of light music as well. These ''divertimenti'' could be used as interludes in stage works, many of the ''divertimenti'' composed in the last half of the 18th century appears to have lost the relation to the theatre, the music in character only having to be a "diversion" in one or another way.

==Examples==
[[File:Alexandre Lunois - Pendant l'entracte.jpg|thumb|''Pendant l'entracte'' (During the entr'acte): [[lithography]] by [[Alexandre Lunois]] published in ''[[L'Artiste]]'' (1894).]]

Some more or less elaborate and/or independent ''entr'actes'' or ''intermezzi'' became famous in their own right, in some cases eclipsing the theatre productions for which they were originally written:
* ''[[La serva padrona]]'', a two-act ''[[opera buffa]]'' by [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]], was intended to break the seriousness of his ''[[opera seria]]'' ''Il prigioner superbo'' (1733). Eventually the ''intermezzo'' got more attention than the large-scale work to which it was added (see ''[[Querelle des Bouffons]]'').
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] shows his mastery in the finale of the first act of ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', where he mixes the ''divertimento''-like dancing (accompanied by a small [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] on the scene) with the actual singing. The characters mingle, performing light dances, while they're supposed to be chasing each other for murder and rape. The diversion and the drama become a single multi-layered item.
* Bizet's opera ''[[Carmen]]'' has ''entr'actes'' before acts 2, 3 and 4; the one before act 3, featuring flute and harp, is often played in concert performances.
* A comparable 'filmic' interlude was foreseen in the early 1930s by [[Alban Berg]] for his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', between the two scenes of the central act. In this case Berg only composed the music and gave a short schematic scenario for a film, that was not yet realised when he died in 1935. The ''Lulu'' interlude film, in contrast to the previous example, was intended to chain the action between the first and second half of the opera. Because of the completely symmetrical structure of this opera, the filmic interlude of ''Lulu'' is, in a manner of speaking, the axis of the opera.
* Interludes of the ''divertimento'' kind can be found in [[Leoš Janáček]]'s last, sombre opera ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'' (1928): releasing the tension after Skuratov's disheartening tale at the centre of the second act, two an "opera" and a "pantomime" within the larger opera are executed consecutively by a cast of prisoners, both presentations [[farce|farcical]] variations on the [[Don Juan]] theme, and mirroring the religious ceremony ''divertimento'' before the Skuratov tale.
* Also, the first publicly performed [[furniture music]] composed by [[Erik Satie]] was [[premiere]]d as ''entr'acte'' music (1920 – the play for which it was written fell into oblivion), with this variation that it was intended as [[background music]] to the sounds the public would usually produce at intermission, walking around and talking. Allegedly, the public did not obey Satie's intention: they kept silently in their places and listened, trained by a habit of incidental music, much to the frustration of the ''[[avant-garde]]'' musicians, who tried to save their idea by inciting the public to get up, talk, and walk around.
* Most of the film adaptations of Broadway musicals shown in  feature ''entr'actes'' during the intermission, which make use of music from the production.
* Many [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] presentations of films from the 1950s through to the 1970s were provided with entr'actes that took the form of overtures to the second part, including most of the adaptations of Broadway musicals released at that time, but the practice soon spread to drama films. In many cases it was the same piece as was used for the overture (as in "[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]" in 1962 and "[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]" in 1968), but others such as "[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]" (1959) and "[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]" (1962) employ different pieces.
*The 1968 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States of America|American]] film [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]] had an "entr'acte" mid-way into the film just after the car drives down the cliff by accident and just before Chitty sprouts wings.
* 1970 film [[Tora! Tora! Tora!]], rather uniquely, was not provided with an overture in any of its releases but did feature a 107-second entr'acte, a different arrangement and orchestration of the main title.
* The 2005 film [[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]] featured a 158-second entr'acte that included a performance of 'Wall Breached' by Harry Gregson-Williams.
* Roadshow releases of the 2015 film [[The Hateful Eight]] were provided with an original orchestral overture composed by [[Ennio Morricone]], but unusually for any media used a [[Crystal Gayle]] performance of the country song [[Ready for the Times to Get Better]] as the entr'acte.
* The 2016 [[Dream Theater (band)|Dream Theater]] album ''[[The Astonishing]]'' features an ''entr'acte'' track entitled "2285 Entr'acte" which bridges the first and second acts of the album.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5750">'''Executive producer''' ('''EP''') is one of the top positions in the making of a commercial [[entertainment]] product. Depending on the [[media (communication)|medium]], the executive producer may be concerned with [[management accounting]] or associated with legal issues (like [[copyright]]s or [[royalties]]).&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Typically an executive producer may handle business and legal issues|url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/E#executive_producer|accessdate= March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the [[Film budgeting|film's budget]] and usually does not work on set, in contrast to most other [[film producer|producer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-executive-producer.htm |title=What is an Executive Producer? |website=WiseGEEK |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Film producer}}
In films, executive producers [[film finance|finance]] the film or participate in the creative effort, but do not work on the set. Their responsibilities vary from [[funding]] or attracting investors into the movie project to [[law|legal]], [[screenplay|scripting]], [[marketing]], advisory and supervising capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Producer (aka Executive in Charge of Production)|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/3086_executive_producer_aka_executive_in_charge_of_production|accessdate= January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard "[[film producer|producers]]"). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film, compared with 3.2 producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many movie producers does a film need?|url=https://stephenfollows.com/how-many-movie-producers-per-film |accessdate= 2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==

In television, an executive producer usually supervises the creative content and the financial aspects of a production. Some writers, like [[Stephen J. Cannell]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same TV show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In television, an Executive Producer may also be the Creator/Writer of a series|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|accessdate = March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of multiple executive producers on a TV show, the one outranking the others is called the [[showrunner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There can be multiple executive producers on a series, but the one in charge is called the showrunner.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_TV_Writer.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the leading executive producer.

==Music==
{{See also|Music executive}}
In recorded music, [[record label]]s distinguish between an executive producer and a [[record producer]]. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer produces the music. Sometimes the executive producer organises the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as [[sound engineer]]s and [[session musician]]s.&lt;ref name="Discovery Channel"&gt;{{cite web|title=The executive producer usually chooses the musicians and technicians for a record, decides where and when to record, and the production budget and timetable|url=http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|accessdate=March 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20130410181827/http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|archivedate=10 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8199">[[File:Man lighting fart on fire.ogv|thumb|Lighting a fart]]
'''Fart lighting''', also known as '''pyroflatulence''' or '''flatus ignition''', is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human [[flatulence]], often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a "'''blue angel'''", "'''blue dart'''", or in [[Australia]], a "'''blue flame'''". The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much [[humour|humorous]] derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to "fire fart", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.

In 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury.&lt;ref name="Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart "&gt;{{cite book  | last =Dawson  | first =Jim  | title=Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart  | publisher=Ten Speed Press | year=1999  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=G8t8doQHi-MC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22fart+lighting%22 | accessdate=2007-10-07  | isbn =9781580080118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity houses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.315 U. of California Press Web site] Retrieved October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as [[YouTube]].

Although there is little [[scientific]] discourse on the [[Combustion|combustive]] properties of [[flatus]], there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in [[comic]] routines, [[movies]], and [[television]]; including [[cartoon]]s.

==Chemistry==
The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of [[gases]] with the following six as major components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ness|first1=M. M.|last2=Cattau|first2=E.

* [[carbon dioxide]],
* [[hydrogen]],
* [[hydrogen sulfide]],
* [[methane]],
* [[nitrogen]],
* [[oxygen]].

Methane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue [[hue]] ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −891 kJ/mol),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080318174637/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6744.html Methane&lt;!-- CRAP Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as:

:{{chem|CH|4}}(g) + 2 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → {{chem|CO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

Hydrogen sulfide also combusts ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −519 kJ/mol)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013120329/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6578.html Hydrogen sulfide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to

:2 {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) + 3 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → 2 {{chem|SO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

The odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, [[skatole]], [[indole]], volatile amines and [[short-chain fatty acid]]s. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, M. D. and Bond, J. H. (1978) in Intestinal Gas and Gastrointestinal Disease&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas production===
Some of the gases are produced by [[bacteria]] which live in [[symbiosis]] within the [[large intestine]]s of humans and other [[mammal]]s. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's [[digestion]] of food into relatively simpler substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A673508 BBC - h2g2 - Farts and Flatulence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by [[aerophagy]], while the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; component results from the reaction of stomach acids ([[HCl]]) with pancreatic bile ([[Sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

'''Fitts for Fight''' was a female duo consisting of Ellinor Aurora Aasgaard and Julie Ilona Balas from [[Kristiansand]] in Norway. They became known when it was revealed that the songs they claimed to have written themselves were made by [[demoscene]] musicians and downloaded from micromusic.net, while the two women added their own often explicit lyrics to the music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www11.nrk.no/urort/article.aspx?articleId=5820022 NRK: Ikke stjel andres låter!]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213215821/http://www11.nrk.no/urort/article.aspx?articleId=5820022 |date=13 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to micromusic.net they have so far identified songs from 505 of YM Rockerz, Binärpilot, [[8 Bit Weapon]], [[Arachno]], Printed Circuit, Yerzmyey, [[Drx]] of [[Bodenständig 2000]], [[Jo Petrole]] and [[Stu Drop da Bomb|Stu]] of [[Drop da Bomb]].

[[File:LePetomane.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Le Pétomane]] was a professional flatulist around the start of the 20th century in France.]]
A '''flatulist''', '''fartist''', or '''professional farter''' is an [[entertainer]] (sometimes considered a [[comedian]]) whose routine consists solely or primarily of [[Flatulence|passing gas]] in a creative, musical, or amusing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljhelms.com/pet/_pujol/thestory/retro.htm Le Pétomane:The Strange Life of a "Fartiste"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are a number of scattered references to [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] flatulists, who could produce various rhythms and pitches with their [[flatulence|intestinal wind]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] in ''City of God (De Civitate Dei)'' (14.24) mentions some performers who did have "such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing." [[Juan Luis Vives]], in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat,{{cn|date=March 2015}} a remark referenced by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in an essay.{{Which|date=December 2017}}

The professional farters of medieval [[Ireland]] were called braigetoír. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century ''Tech Midchúarda'', a diagram of the banqueting hall of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by [[bard]]s, [[fili]], and [[harp]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The bagpipe: the history of a musical instrument | first=Francis M. | last=Collinson | publisher=Routledge | year=1975 | isbn=0-7100-7913-3 | page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Drama and the performing arts in pre-Cromwellian Ireland: a repertory of sources and documents from the earliest times until c. 1642 | first=Alan John | last=Fletcher | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer | year=2001 | isbn=0-85991-573-5 | page=468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English ''Liber Feodorum'' or ''[[Book of Fees]]''. It lists one [[Roland the Farter]], who held [[Hemingstone]] manor in the county of [[Suffolk]], for which he was obliged to perform ''"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum"'' (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] every Christmas. The ''Activa Vita'' character in the 14th century allegorical poem [[Piers Plowman]] appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meredith, [http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ "The professional travelling players of the fifteenth century: myth or reality?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714165129/http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ |date=2012-07-14 }} ''European Medieval Drama'' '''2''' (1998) 21-34. DOI 10.1484/J.EMD.2.300900&lt;/ref&gt; This poem translates to "As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp."

In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], flatulists were known as "heppiri otoko" (放屁男), lit. "farting men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

A '''frame story''' (also known as a '''frame tale''' or '''frame narrative''') is a [[literary technique]] that sometimes serves as a companion piece to a [[story within a story]], whereby an introductory or main narrative is presented, at least in part, for the purpose of setting the stage either for a more emphasized second narrative or for a set of shorter stories. The frame story leads readers from a first story into another, smaller one (or several ones) within it. The frame story may also be used to allow readers to understand a part of the story, then jump to another part that can now be understood. This is not however, to be mixed up with a narrative structure or character personality change.

== Origins ==
Some of the earliest known frame stories are those from ancient Egypt, including one found in the [[Papyrus Westcar]], the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]'', and ''[[The Eloquent Peasant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orality and Literacy in the Demotic Tales|page=27-32, 211-212|last1=Jay|first1=Jacqueline E.|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004323070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples are from [[Indian literature]], including the [[Indian epic poetry|Sanskrit epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Panchatantra]]'', [[Syntipas]]'s ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Wise Masters]]'', and the [[fable]] collections ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael E. J. Witzel |first=Michael E. J. |last=Witzel |chapter=On the origin of the literary device of the 'Frame Story' in Old Indian literature |title=Hinduismus und Buddhismus, Festschrift für U. Schneider |editor-first=H. |editor-last=Falk |location=Freiburg |year=1987 |pages=380–414 |isbn=3-925270-01-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form gradually spread west through the centuries and became popular, giving rise to such classic frame tale collections as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), ''[[The Decameron]]'', and ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.  This format had flexibility in that various narrators could retain the stories they liked or understood, while dropping ones they didn't and adding new ones they heard from other places.  This occurred particularly with ''One Thousand and One Nights'', where different versions over the centuries have included different stories.

The use of a frame story in which a single narrative is set in the context of the telling of a story is also a technique with a long history, dating back at least to the beginning section of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the narrator [[Odysseus]] tells of his wandering in the court of King [[Alcinous]].

== A set of stories ==

This [[literary device]] acts as a convenient [[conceit]] for the organization of a set of smaller narratives, which are either of the devising of the author or taken from a previous stock of popular tales, slightly altered by the author for the purpose of the longer narrative. Sometimes a story within the main narrative can be used to sum up or encapsulate some aspect of the framing story, in which case it is referred to in literary criticism by the French term ''[[mise en abyme]]''.

A typical example of a frame story is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which the character [[Shahrazad]] narrates a set of [[fairy tale]]s to the Sultan [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahriyar]] over many nights. Many of Shahrazad's tales are also frame stories, such as ''[[Sindbad the Sailor|Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman]]'', a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

Extensive use of this device is found in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', where the stories nest several deep, to allow the inclusion of many different tales in one work. [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' uses this literary device to tell the story of Heathcliff and Catherine, along with the subplots. Her sister [[Anne Brontë|Anne]] also uses this device in her [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]''. The main heroine's diary is framed by the narrator's story and letters.

[[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is another good example of a book with multiple framed narratives. In the book, Robert Walton writes letters to his sister describing the story told to him by [[Victor Frankenstein]]; Frankenstein's story contains the creature's story; the [[Frankenstein's monster|creature's]] story even briefly contains the story of a family among whom it had been living.

Frame stories have also appeared in other media, such as [[comic book]]s. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' featured a story arc called ''Worlds End'' which consisted of frame stories, and sometimes even featured stories within stories within stories.

Frame stories are often organized as a gathering of people in one place for the exchange of stories. Each character tells his or her tale, and the frame tale progresses in that manner. Historically famous frame stories include [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', about a group of pilgrims who tell stories on their journey to Canterbury; and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' about a group of young aristocrats escaping the Black Death in the countryside and spending the time telling stories.

[[File:QuidorRipVanWinkle.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''The Return of [[Rip Van Winkle]]'', painting by [[John Quidor]], 1849]]
Sometimes only one storyteller exists, and in this case there might be different levels of distance between the reader and author. In this mode, the frame tale can become more fuzzy. In [[Washington Irving]]'s ''Sketch Book'', which contains "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" and "[[Rip Van Winkle]]" among others, the conceit is that the author of the book is not Irving, but a certain gentleman named Crayon. Here the frame includes the world of the imagined Crayon, his stories, and the possible{{clarify|date=June 2016}} reader who is assumed to play along and "know" who Crayon is.

[[Donald Westlake]]'s short story "No Story" is a parody of frame stories, in which a series of narrators start to tell stories, each of which contains a narrator who starts to tell a story, culminating in a narrator who announces that there will be no story. Essentially, it is a frame story without a story to be framed.

== Single story ==

When there is a single story, the frame story is used for other purposes&amp;nbsp;– chiefly to position the reader's attitude toward the tale.  One common one is to draw attention to the [[Unreliable narrator|narrator's unreliability]].  By explicitly making the narrator a character within the frame story, the writer distances him or herself from the narrator; she or he may also characterize the narrator to cast doubt on the narrator's truthfulness. In [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s stories of [[Mr Mulliner]],  Mulliner is made a [[Fly fishing|fly fisherman]] in order to cast doubt on the outrageous stories he tells.  The movie ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' is framed as a story an old [[Antonio Salieri]] tells to a young priest, because the movie is based more on stories Salieri told about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] than on historical fact. 

Another use is a form of [[procatalepsis]], where the writer puts the readers' possible reactions to the story in the characters listening to it.  In  ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' the frame of a grandfather reading the story to his reluctant grandson puts the cynical reaction a viewer might have to the romantic fairytale into the story in the grandson's persona, and helps defuse it.  This is the use when the frame tells a story that lacks a strong [[narrative hook]] in its opening; the narrator can engage the reader's interest by telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand later actions, thereby identifying the reader's wondering whether the story is worth reading to the listeners'. Such an approach was used by Edith Wharton in her novella [[Ethan Frome]], in which a nameless narrator hears from many characters in the town of Starkfield about the main character Ethan's story.

A specialized form of the frame is a [[dream vision]], where the narrator claims to have gone to sleep, dreamed the events of the story, and then awoken to tell the tale.  In medieval Europe, this was a common device, used to indicate that the events included are fictional; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used it in ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'' (the last also containing a multi-story frame story within the dream).  In modern usage, it is sometimes used in works of [[fantasy]] as a means toward [[suspension of disbelief]] about the marvels depicted in the story.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" complained of such devices as unwillingness to treat the genre seriously.  [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' stories (''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'') includes such a frame, but unlike most usages, the stories themselves use dream-like logic and sequences; most dream frames frame stories that appear exactly as if occurring in real life. The writer [[John Bunyan]] used a dream device in the Christian allegory [[Pilgrim's Progress]] and its sequel, explaining that they were dreams he had while he was in prison and felt God wanted him to write down. This worked because it made what might have been seen as a fantasy something more realistic and meaningful to others who believed as he did.

Still, even when the story proceeds realistically, the dream frame casts doubt on the events.  In the book, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the events really occur; the dream frame added for [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|the movie]] detracts from the validity of the fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven Swann |last=Jones |title=The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-8057-0950-9 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=qkfYAAAAMAAJ |pages=94 }} |page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
As with all [[conceit|literary conceits]], the frame tale has many variations, some clearly within the confines of the conceit, some on the border, and some pushing the boundaries of understanding.  The main goal of a frame tale is as a conceit which can adequately collect otherwise disparate tales. It has been mostly replaced, in modern literature, by the short story collection or anthology absent of any authorial conceit and other rhetorical devices.

To be a frame narrative, the story must act primarily as an occasion for the telling of other stories.  If the framing narrative has primary or equal interest, then it is not usually a frame narrative.  For example, [[Odysseus]] narrates much of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' to the [[Scheria|Phaeacians]], but, even though this recollection forms a great part of the poem, the events after and before the interpolated recollection are of greater interest than the memory.

Another notable example that plays with frame narrative is the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.  Most of the film is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the park bench.  However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest gets up and leaves the bench, and we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son.  This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny's dialogues.

This approach is also demonstrated in the 2008 film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (adapted from the 2005 novel ''[[Q &amp; A (novel)|Q &amp; A]]''), about a poor street kid Jamal coming close to winning ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'' (the [[India]]n version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'') and then being suspected of cheating. Most of the story is narrated at a police station by Jamal, who narrates how he knew the answers to the questions as the show is played back on video. The show itself then serves as another [[framing device]], as Jamal sees [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of his past as each question is asked. The last portion of the film then unfolds without any narrator.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' demonstrates a narrator telling a story, while the protagonist is quoted so as to give the framed appearance that he is telling the story. The narrator provides the transition to the one speaking the story.

A famous literary example is Emily Brontë's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', whereby we learn events through a visitor to the house of the title, who in turn has been told these events by the housekeeper of the Linton family. None of the main characters ever directly narrates.

Another example is [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] 2004 novel [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]], which is a frame story inside a frame story inside a frame story – and so on.  There are six stories in all, each framed inside the other, forming a [[chiastic structure]] to a [[Catharsis|semi-cathartic]] tale spanning centuries of narrative.

Frame stories are found in many [[role-playing video game]]s, such as the early ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]'', released in 1990. This literary device can also be sparingly used to achieve secondary ends. For instance, the ''[[Shining Force]]'' series of role playing games use narrators within frame stories to implement things like starting, saving and exiting the game without breaking the [[fourth wall]] entirely, or rather by constructing a second fourth wall to shield the player from having to suspend his/her disbelief as much. A similar approach was used in the [[open world]] video game ''[[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven]]'', where the game's missions are presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by Tommy Angelo, as he confesses his involvement with an [[American Mafia]] family. Another example of frame stories in video games is the game [[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]. Catherine's first scene is a frame story.

In the game ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'', the Kid's actions are narrated by one of the other characters, Rucks, as he tells the Kid's story to another character while the Kid is in the final area. Because Rucks never learns about the Kid's actions explicitly, the narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to keep the fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.

Another example is ''[[Persona 5]]'', which begins ''[[in medias res]]'' and is largely framed around Sae Niijima's interrogation of the protagonist, henceforth referred to by his [[code name]] "Joker" since the character's proper name is player-defined. During the story, Niijima introduces the audience to antagonists the Phantom Thieves have targeted, and whenever a Confidant besides Niijima (who cuts a deal with Joker during the interrogation) or the Velvet Room residents is unlocked, she will press Joker for information on accomplices and skills. Whenever a new party member is introduced, Niijima will press Joker on how he knew them, reacting with horror at the point in the game when her younger sister Makoto becomes a Phantom Thief. Should the player fail to complete a Palace by its deadline, the resulting [[game over]] is framed as a [[truth serum]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] Joker is suffering from preventing him from recalling events correctly and a mysterious man - heavily implied and later confirmed to be a traitor to the Phantom Thieves - murdering him in cold blood while Niijima leaves to allow him to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Persona 5]]|developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]], [[Deep Silver]] |date= April 4, 2017|platform= [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]]|level = Police Station|quote = '''Sae Niijima''': ...Is that the entirety of your testimony? *sigh* Do you have no intention of saying anything more? Or is the overdose affecting your memory...? In any case, it seems it'd be a waste of time to speak to you any longer. It's unfortunate. ''[Soon after Niijima has left, a mysterious man holds Joker at gunpoint]''/'''Mysterious Man''': ...Allow me to enlighten you. That trivial righteousness that you've paraded around...? This is how such idiocy ends. ''[shoots Joker in the head, killing him instantly]'' ...Farewell.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a more minor memory problem caused by the truth serum overdose is used to avoid revealing the traitor's identity too early. The device is dropped once the in-game calendar reaches the day of the interrogation, as the prologue leads into the interrogation and the main conflict is still far from resolved by this date.

== Compared to reprise ==
{{See also|Reprise}}

In musical [[sonata form]] or [[rondo]], a theme occurs at the beginning and end of the work, or returns periodically. This could most simply be a recurrence or restatement of a melody or song. For example, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]" works as a framing device for their [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], appearing at the beginning and end of the album. Other albums with similar devices include Paul McCartney &amp; [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' ''[[Band on the Run]]'', the recurring heartbeats in [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''   and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' ("[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]"), [[Supertramp]]'s ''[[Crime of the Century (album)|Crime of the Century]]'' (the harmonica riff at the beginning of "School" is reprised at the end of the title track), and [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]]'s ''[[Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]]'' ("You have the world at your fingertips/No one can make it better than you"). Another is Junior Senior's 'D-D-D-Don't Stop The Beat' album which ends with a reprise of the first notes from the opening track. The closing track of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' is a reprise of the opening track "[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight]]."

A reprise may be expressed in narrative: at the beginning and the end of the movie ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character shoots the noose to save his partner from hanging.

At the beginning of the 1992 movie ''[[Far and Away]]'', the father "dies" and then returns to life briefly. The same thing happens in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' where Tom Cruise's character "dies" and then comes back to life.

Framing devices may also take the form of a recurrent element that appears at the beginning and the end of the narrative. For example, a story may begin with a character visiting a park under one set of circumstances, then returning at the end to the same park under a different set of circumstances, having undergone a change that allows him or her to see the park in a new light.
 
A framing device might also simply be a defining image of the narrative or art that is used at the beginning and end of the work. 

An example of this is in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' which begins and ends with the characters running along a beach, accompanied at both times by the movie’s famous theme music. This scene, although chronologically occurring in the middle of the film and unimportant to the straightforward plot, serves to convey a defining emotion and tone that sets the context for the main story.

[[Image:Harlem-magicians-poster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poster for a basketball event involving Harlem Magicians]] 
'''Harlem Magicians''' was a [[basketball]] enterprise founded in 1953 by Lon Varnell through his Varnell Enterprises, that was similar in fashion and activities to the basketball entertainment program the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. The full name of the [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] [[basketball]] team was '''The Fabulous Harlem Magicians''' with the main star attraction of the team being [[Marques Haynes]]. Haynes had been a member of the Globetrotters, but had left the team due to a contract dispute to join the Magicians. Other famous players in the team were [[Goose Tatum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talesofelnora.blogspot.com/2008/12/night-harlem-magicians-came-to-town.html The Night the Harlem Magicians Came to Town]&lt;/ref&gt; Bob "Ergie" Erickson (who once stole the ball from Haynes four times in one game), and [[Ron Cavenall]]. [[Dempsey Hovland]], founder of 20th Century Booking Agency and himself owner of several barnstorming teams was recruited to book the Harlem Magicians' games. 

In late 1961, [[Abe Saperstein]], founder and owner of the Harlem Globetrotters opened a lawsuit against Lon Varnell for alleged violation of Harlem Globetrotters' registered trademarks, "Harlem Globetrotters" and "Magicians of Basketball" by promoting a basketball team known as the "Harlem Magicians". In 1964, the parties settled the litigation by entering a consent decree approved by the District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/872/f2d/1025/harlem-globetrotters-incorporated-v-harlem-magicians-incorporated Harlem Globetrotters, Incorporated, Plaintiff-Appellee v.

'''Humor styles''' are a topic of research in the field of [[personality psychology]] related to the ways in which individuals differ in their use of [[humor]] in everyday life.  People of all ages and backgrounds engage in humor, but the way they use it can vary greatly. Although humor styles can vary slightly depending on the situation, they tend to be a relatively stable personality characteristic among individuals.  That is, individuals are fairly consistent in the ways they use humor over time.&lt;ref name=Willibald /&gt;

The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) has emerged as a robust model for understanding the individual differences in humor styles.  Humor can be used to enhance the [[self]] or enhance one's relationship with others.  Humor can be relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental (either to the self or others).&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Some styles of humor promote health and [[quality of life|well-being]], while other styles can be potentially detrimental to mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Willibald&gt;{{cite book|last=Willibald|first=Ruch|title=Explorations of a Personality Characteristic|year=1998|publisher=DE GRUYTER MOUTON|isbn=9783110804607|pages=159–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ)==
The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed by Rod Martin and Patricia Doris (2003) to measure individual differences in styles of humor.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  Humor has been shown to be a personality characteristic that remains relatively stable over time.&lt;ref name=Willibald /&gt;  Humor is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional trait.  However, individuals seem to differ in the ways in which they use humor in their everyday lives, and different styles of humor seem to have different outcomes.  The Humor Styles Questionnaire was developed to identify the ways in which individuals differ in humor styles and how these differences influence health, well-being, relationships, and other outcomes.&lt;ref name=HSQ /&gt;

The Humor Styles Questionnaire is a 32-item [[self-report study|self-report inventory]] used to identify how individuals use humor in their lives.  Participants respond to the degree to which they agree with each statement (e.g., "I enjoy making people laugh") on a scale from 1 (''totally disagree'') to 7 (''totally agree'').  The questionnaire measures two main factors in humor.  The first factor measures whether humor is used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationships with others.  The second factor measures whether the humor is relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental and destructive.  The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating.&lt;ref name=HSQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Rod |title=Humor Styles Questionnaire |url=http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ISHS%20Test%20Bank/TestCat_HSQ.htm |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416154913/http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ISHS%20Test%20Bank/TestCat_HSQ.htm |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliative humor===
'''Affiliative humor''' is defined as the style of humor used to enhance one's relationships with others in a benevolent, positive manner.  This style of humor is typically used in a benevolent, [[self-acceptance|self-accepting]] way. Individuals high in this dimension often use humor as a way to charm and amuse others, ease tension among others, and improve relationships.  They are often spontaneous in their joke telling, frequently participate in witty banter, and enjoy laughing with others. Affiliative humor is similar to self-defeating humor because both styles of humor enhance the relationships with others.  However, unlike self-defeating humor, affiliative humor is not used at one's own expense.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

A number of outcomes are associated with the use of affiliative humor. Individuals who report high levels of affiliative humor are more likely to initiate friendships.&lt;ref name=Yip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yip|first=Jeremy|author2=Rod Martin|title=Sense of humor, emotional intelligence, and social competence|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=December 2006|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1202–1208|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656605000577|accessdate=6 April 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2005.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an organizational setting, affiliative humor has been shown to increase group cohesiveness and promote creativity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Workplace&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Eric|author2=Kevin Cruthirds|title=The Use of Humor in the Workplace|journal=Academy of Management Perspectives|date=May 2006|volume=20|issue=2|pages=58–69|url=http://uv7gq6an4y.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=EJ&amp;aulast=Romero&amp;atitle=The+use+of+humor+in+the+workplace&amp;title=Academy+of+Management+perspectives&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=2&amp;date=2006&amp;spage=58&amp;issn=1558-9080|accessdate=13 April 2012|doi=10.5465/amp.2006.20591005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliative humor is also associated with increased levels of (explicit) [[self-esteem]], psychological well-being, [[Neuroticism|emotional stability]], and social intimacy. They are also more likely to exhibit higher levels of [[implicit self-esteem]] (independently of their level of explicit self-esteem).&lt;ref&gt;

This style of humor is associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms&lt;ref name=Frewen /&gt; and anxiety.  Individuals who use affiliative humor tend to have higher levels of [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]] as personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of items targeting affiliative humor on the HSQ include:
* I don't often joke around with my friends.
* I rarely make other people laugh by telling funny stories about myself. (reversed)

===Self-enhancing humor===
'''Self-enhancing humor''' is a style of humor related to having a good-natured attitude toward life, having the ability to laugh at yourself, your circumstances and the idiosyncrasies of life in constructive, non-detrimental manner. It is used by individuals to enhance the self in a benevolent, positive manner.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  This type of humor is best understood as a type of [[coping (psychology)|coping]] or [[emotion self-regulation|emotion-regulating]] humor in which individuals use humor to look on the bright side of a bad situation, find the silver lining or maintain a positive attitude even in trying times.&lt;ref name=Martin1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Rod|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=July 2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=504–519|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.504}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-enhancing humor is associated with a number of personality variables as well as psychological, physical and health-related outcomes.  Individuals who engage more in the self-enhancing humor style are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Frewen /&gt;  In an organizational setting, self-enhancing humor has been shown to promote creativity and reduce stress in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Workplace /&gt;  The self-enhancing style of humor has also been shown to be related to increased levels of self-esteem, [[optimism]], and psychological well-being, as well as decreased levels of depression and anxiety. Individuals who use the self-enhancing humor style are more likely to exhibit [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]] as personality characteristics and less likely to exhibit [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of self-enhancing humor on the HSQ include:
*If I am feeling upset or unhappy I usually try to think of something funny about the situation to make myself feel better.
*Even when I’m by myself, I’m often amused by the absurdities of life.

===Aggressive humor===
'''Aggressive humor''' is a style of humor that is potentially detrimental towards others.   This type of humor is characterized by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, ridicule, and other types of humor used at the expense of others. Aggressive humor often disregards the impact it might have on others.  Prejudices such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]] are considered to be the aggressive style of humor.  This type of humor may at times seem like playful fun, but sometimes the underlying intent is to harm or belittle others.  Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of [[neuroticism]] and lower levels of [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Individuals who exhibit higher levels of aggressive humor tend to score higher on measures of hostility and general aggression.  Males tend to use aggressive humor more often than women.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of aggressive humor on the HSQ might include:
*When telling jokes or saying funny things, I am usually not very concerned about how other people are taking it.
*People are never offended or hurt by my sense of humor. (reversed)
*If you think people are laughing at you, they probably are.

===Self-defeating humor===
'''Self-defeating humor''' is the style of humor characterized by the use of potentially detrimental humor towards the self in order to gain approval from others.  Individuals high in this dimension engage in self-disparaging humor in which laughter is often at their own expense.  Self-defeating humor often comes in the form of pleasing others by being the "butt" of the joke. This style of humor is sometimes seen as a form of [[denial]] in which humor is used as a [[defense mechanism]] for hiding negative feelings about the self.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Rod|author2=Patricia Puhlik-Doris |author3=Gwen Larsen |author4=Jeanette Gray |author5=Kelly Weir |title=Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the Humor Styles Questionnaire|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=February 2003|volume=37|issue=1|pages=48–75|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656602005342#BIB31|accessdate=26 March 2012|doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00534-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of variables are associated with self-defeating humor. Individuals who more frequently use self-defeating humor show increased depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Frewen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frewen|first=Paul|author2=Jaylene Brinker |author3=Rod Martin |author4=David Dozois |title=Humor styles and personality-vulnerability to depression|journal=Humor|year=2008|volume=21|series=2|pages=179–195|doi=10.1515/humor.2008.009}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 April 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who use this style of humor tend to have higher levels of [[neuroticism]] and lower levels of [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].  Self-defeating humor is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms.  It is also associated with lower levels of self-esteem, psychological well-being and intimacy.

Examples of self-defeating items on the Humor Styles Questionnaire might include:
*I often try to make people like or accept me more by saying something funny about my own weaknesses, blunders, or faults.
*If I am having problems or feeling unhappy, I often cover it up by joking around, so that even my closest friends don’t know how I really feel.

{{Translation sidebar}}
'''Humour in translation''' can be caused by translation errors, because of irregularities and discrepancies between certain items that translators attempt to translate. This could be due to the ignorance of the translator, as well as the untranslatability of the text as a result of linguistic or cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alam | first1 = Q.Z. | year = 1989 | title = Humour and Translation: Evidence from Indian English | url = | journal = Translators' Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 72–78 | doi=10.7202/004646ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, translation errors can be caused by the language incompetence of the translator in the target language, resulting in unintended ambiguity in the message conveyed. Translation errors can distort the intended meaning of the author or speaker, to the point of absurdity and ludicrousness, giving a humorous and comedic effect.
Translation errors can cause accidental humour, which is similar to intentional humour. Like intentional humour, accidental humour is also a combination of linguistics and culture-specific features, with humour generating devices (like words and phrases) embedded in it, and is just as competent in conveying humour.

Most translation errors are due to the [[untranslatability]] of the language and the failure of linguistic [[domestication]] and [[foreignization]] processes.  For instance, idiomatic expressions of Chinese like 多多少少 ( [ˈduɔ duɔ ʃaʊ ʃaʊˈ] ) means ‘to an extent’ in English. However, if literally translated, the same phrase can mean ‘many many few few’, losing its original meaning and creating a ludicrous expression of meaning. A case of untranslatability is evident when Coca-Cola first entered the Chinese market in 1928.  Initially there was no official representation of Coca Cola’s name in Mandarin, and random phonetic translation of Coca Cola using random Chinese characters of similar phonetics were used, resulting in the name conveying ridiculous meanings like "female horse fastened with wax" or "bite the wax tadpole" when read. There was hence a need to find four Chinese characters with pronunciations and phonology approximated the sounds "Coca Cola" without producing a nonsensical or adverse meaning when combined into a written phrase. This [[brand blunder]] was eventually solved when the Chinese words [[可口可乐]] were used instead; meaning to be translated as "to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice," but conceptually acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Allman, N.F. (1957).  Transliteration of 'Coca-Cola' Trade-Mark to Chinese Characters. Coca-Cola Overseas, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the combination and translation of words expressed must conform to the target culture and literal [[language interpretation]] or it would result in hilarious misunderstandings. Prime examples of such errors comes in the form of poorly translated sign posts, notices and menus that fails to cater the intended meaning to both foreign and local speakers.

Translation errors have been used widely for commercial and entertainment purposes (intentional humour). A prominent example is the comedy video, "Japanese Titanic" by the YouTube comedy duo, [[Smosh]]. Garnering more than 8.5 million views to date, the farcical video script was produced by translating the original dialogue of the movie ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' into Japanese dialogue via an online translator application, then translating the Japanese dialogue back into English.&lt;ref&gt;SMOSH. (2013, June 28). JAPANESE TITANIC [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2Ai6HAo7Y&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation difficulties ==

Colloquial expressions and conventions in the source language, can cause humour or result in a strange interpretation from the listener or reader in instances when they are not translated into equivalent expressions or conventions in the target language, and instead are translated mechanically or word-for-word.

Difficulties with translation can arise from differences in word order, or from culture-bound expressions, and often also because of the inflexibility of [[machine translation]]. Also, it is due partly to the existence of multiple cultural, linguistic and semantic factors that machine translation often requires the aid of a human translator to convey the intended message of the source text.

Translation difficulties can, therefore, cause translation errors, which can result in humour. A more specific elaboration of various causes of translation errors will be discussed in the following section.

== Translation error types and resultant humour ==
Below are some components of linguistic stimulus theories that attempts to explain the way humour might be derived from translations, as adapted from ''Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English'''&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

External factors like cultural awareness, time considerations, social class and educational considerations, along with internal factors like situation and narrative strategy also plays a big part in the effect of translation on humour.

=== Ambiguity ===
Words that are [[homonym]]ic, paronymic, [[alliterative]] or rhyming, or metalinguistic devices of language can be used to produce humour. Also, wordplay which includes the use of puns, one liners, [[limericks]], witticisms, among various others, can be another way to produce humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zabalbeascoa | first1 = P | year = 2005 | title = Humor and translation - an interdiscipline | url = | journal = Humor-International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 185–207 | doi=10.1515/humr.2005.18.2.185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, these are some funny translations done by machine translators:
* In the office of a doctor in Rome: ''Specialist in women and other diseases''.
* In a Japanese hotel: ''You are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid''.
* In a Norwegian cocktail lounge: ''Ladies are requested not to have children in the bar''.

=== Semantic overlap ===

Humour can result from the interlocutor’s inability to understand [[homonyms]], [[homographs]] or semantically related [[synonym]] words. Similarly, words with superordinate and subordinate relationships are confused.

Overlapping semantics are difficult to distinguish, especially in translation. Words with multiple meanings ([[polysemous]] words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.
Confusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for hyponym, hyponym for superonym, a whole word for a partial word, a partial word for a whole word, antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3615284 | pmid=23675212 | volume=6 | title=Lexis in Chinese-English Translation of Drug Package Inserts: Corpus-based Error Analysis and Its Translation Strategies | year=2010 | journal=Int J Biomed Sci | pages=344–50 | last1 = Ying | first1 = L | last2 = Yumei | first2 = Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of semantic overlap found in a golf course:

"''ANY PERSONS (EXCEPT PLAYERS) CAUGHT COLLECTING GOLF BALLS ON THIS COURSE WILL BE PROSECUTED AND HAVE THEIR BALLS REMOVED''" &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. (2009). Appendix C: English Signage from around the world. In English: the Prototypical World Language for the Twenty First Century (p. 205).&lt;/ref&gt;

The interlocutor's erroneous choice of word ''removed'' instead of ''confiscated'' results in accidental humor in the context as shown in the example above. Semantically, ''removed'' is a commonly used word to express the action ‘take away’ and both are related in terms of sense. ''Removed'' thus may be used as a superordinate form that includes the action of ''taking away''.  The humorous aspect of this situation is intensified with the strong use of word ''removed'' in the phrase ''have their balls removed'', relates to the sexual innuendo of castration instead of the much less extreme action of confiscation. With the overlapping of semantics, the intended message is thus misinterpreted and accidental humor is resulted.

| General Motors first introduced the Chevy Nova in South America. However, it was not aware that "No Va" means "it won't go."

When it finally realised the reason why it was not able to sell any cars, it renamed the car in some of its
Spanish markets to "Chevrolet Chevy".

Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when "the Pinto" flopped. The company
found out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for "tiny male genitals".

Ford then changed all the nameplates, substituting it with "Corcel", meaning "horse".&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, P. M. (n.d.). Translation Funnies. Retrieved from http://www.ojohaven.com/fun/translation.funnies.html#footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexico-semantic clusterings can result in paradigmatic errors. It reflects the relations between related words and expressions, which is mainly of paradigmatic relations. The humor above is triggered by the translated text consisting of a script-switch trigger, which then results in the double reading. The irony is not lost in the contexts provided.

In machine translation from Chinese to English the phrase "Fuck the certain price of goods" has become proverbial for absurd machine mistranslations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fuck+the+certain%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b Google search&lt;/ref&gt; That text was on a Chinese / English bilingual sign in a supermarket and should have read "Dry goods department". The [[Simplified Chinese]] character 干 (link: [[干]]) can mean "do" and "dry" and "fuck".

=== Lexical gaps (Pragmatics)===

Lexical gaps concerns words or phrases with no direct translation in any given language.

| Untranslatable words include:
"Scorpie" (Romanian) which refers to a mean and ugly woman.
"Torschlusspanik" (German) which means ‘gate-closing panic’. Though, if you separate the last word into its components, "Torschluss" and "panik", and enter them in almost any translation machine, this will show: "gate closures panic". 
|}

Humor, then, results from the interlocutor's inability to grasp the lexical gaps in target language and linguistic representations may either be over generalised or under generalised to the point of absurdity.

"''Take one of our horse-driven city tours. We guarantee no miscarriages''."&lt;ref&gt;Gorea, L. (2012). ''Lost in Translation.'' Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council. Retrieved October 17, 2014 from http://www.cttic.org/ACTI/2012/Actes/Lucia%20Gorea.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The humour comes from the translator filling in an English lexical gap based on the lexical noun, "miss" by adding a prefix ''mis-''. English employs the two verbs ''miss the carriage'' and ''miscarriages'' to mean vastly different actions. There is a lexical gap in English because the action of ''missing a carriage'' cannot be expressed with the same import and the same economy of verbalisation. The misuse of this lexical gap and overgeneralisation conflates the ludicrous idea of the horse-driven tours with no miscarriages.

"''Teeth are extracted by the latest Methodists''." &lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, C. (n.d.). King's English. Retrieved from http://www.gerryhemingway.com/kingsenglish.html&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

From the example above, the interlocutor did not understand English derivations of ‘doer’ nouns such as, ''specialist'', or [[suppletion]] such as, ''experts'' and mistakenly uses the derivational pattern to coin a lexeme from ''method''. Accidental humour ensues as a result of the same word coinciding with the unlikely homophone ''Methodist'', which refers to the Christian religious denomination, creating a ridiculous situation in the context of dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;Gorea, L.

An American slogan for Salem cigarettes was, "Salem - Feeling Free,". When translated for marketing in the Japanese market, it means, "When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty".&lt;ref&gt;Arslan, M., KESİK, C., &amp; KARSAN, A. (2007). A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES ON MNCs WITH ILLUSTRATIVE CASES, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the translator trying to fill in the connotations of the lexical unit "free", perhaps because of limited vocabulary competency and thus resulting in an intralingual error. In this case there are actually Japanese terms equivalent to the adjective, "free" ( e.g. : 自由な).

All being said, languages do have a [[productive (linguistics)]] and recursion property that can also allow words and phrases to combine creatively to fill in the lexical gaps.

For example, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] expressions above can seem nearly impossible to translate. But with the usage of English to translate and establish the context, the meanings of the expression can be derived to be understandable.

=== Morpho-phonological similarity ===

In some cases, incidental humor is produced when interlocutors erroneously uses [[lexeme]]s based on vague morpho-phonological similarity to the target word.

Japan's second-largest tourist agency was rather bewildered when it initially entered English markets and began receiving overwhelming requests for sexual tours. When they finally realized it, Kinki Nippon Tourist Company decided to change its name.&lt;ref&gt;KNT. (2012, August 14).

An interesting and amusing example would be the pronunciation of English words with Chinese translatability by actor Xiao Xiao Bin in the 2010 comedy-martial arts film ''[[Just Call Me Nobody]]'':

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
 (1) [Yes] → 爷死 /ji̯ɛ sɨ/ ‘Grandpa dies’
 (2) [Nice]→ 奶死 /naɪ̯ sɨ/ ‘Grandma dies’
 (3) [Bus] →爸死 /bɑ sɨ/ ‘Dad dies’
 (4) [Knees] →你死 /ni sɨ/ ‘You die’
 (5) [Was]→ 我死 /wu̯ɔ sɨ/‘I die’
 (6) [Does] →都死 /tɤʊ̯ sɨ/ ‘All die’
 (7) [One dollar] → "完蛋了 /wu̯an tan lɯ̯ʌ/ ‘It’s over’
|}

The examples from (1) to (7) illustrates the complete loss of the original meaning of the English words. Though the English pronounced sounds almost phonetically correct, the pronunciation is easily translatable to a Chinese lexeme of a depressing meaning (e.g. : ‘All die’). With the juxtaposition of the intended and accidental meaning with the cheerful [[pragmatics]] of the film, the translation becomes a hilariously erroneous one.

=== Misspelling ===

Misspelled words can be portrayed as the most basic level of inducing unintentional humor that occur in all translations, especially in signs or restaurants' menus. The ability to create humor out of misspelled words in translations happens particularly when the lexical items in a phrase or sentence are very well-known and common to English speakers but in a particular context, the lexical items appears to possess a totally different meaning that could be inappropriate at times.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kharabsheh, A. (2008). Unintentional Humour in the Translation of Jordanian Shop Signs. In Journal of Intercultural Communication, ISSN 1404-1634, 17.

 (1) ''dumplings'' written as ''dumpings'' 
 (2) ''discount'' written as ''discunt''  
 (3) ''coke'' written as ''cock''
 (4) ''crab'' written as ''crap'' 
 (5) ''shitting'' written as ''shiting''  
 (6) ''pond'' written as ''porn''
 (7) ''lunch'' written as ''launch''  
 (8) ''footwear'' written as ''foodwear'' 
 (9) ''bedsheet'' written as ''bedshit'' 
 (10) ''tested'' written as ''tasted'' in a hospital's sign "''diagnostic for blood, urine, semen, stool and pregnancy, etc are tasted here''." 
|}

All these examples clearly show how inadvertent spelling of words can give rise to humorous transcriptions to anyone who possess a fair flair of English. In examples (4-6, 8, 9), ‘crap’, ‘shiting’, ‘porn’, ‘food’, ‘shit’ were blatantly misspelled by the translators in a way that they all share the same phonological but a complete different semantics form of another already existing pejorative word in English; ‘crab’, ‘shitting’, ‘pond’, ‘foot’ and ‘sheet’ respectively. Thus, all these examples produce unexpected smutty farce-comedy for readers, where humour seeps in as a natural corollary of this linguistic coincidence. Innocuous as the spelling mistakes may seem, the examples above (1-3, 7, 10) were also misspelled to other words that have a total different meanings as the intended words. ‘Dumping’ means the act of removing waste or garbage and it was associated with a food - ‘dumplings’. Likewise, ‘footwear’, which is worn on your foot, is written as ‘food-wear’. Additionally, ‘discount’ is written as ‘dis-cunt’ whereby cunt is an obscene word. Lastly, ‘tested’ and ‘tasted’ have a complete distinct meanings. ‘Tested’ means to identify or characterize a substance or constituents whereas ‘tasted’ means to sense the flavor of something. Thus in the case of example 10, humour not only springs from the misspelled word ‘tasted’ but is also accidentally heightened by the existence of the phrase ‘diagnostic for blood, urine, semain, stool and pregnancy’, which creates a state of intolerable linguistic redundancy. Hence, in these ways, misspelling can give a tantalising feeling of amusement to readers.&lt;ref&gt;Nashrulla, T. (2013). 29 Spelling Mistakes From India That Will Make You Laugh, Cry and Gag. In Buzzfeed.com. Retrieved from https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/29-spelling-mistakes-from-india-that-will-make-you-laugh-cry#8h0ge6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== References ===

Using the wrong reference may change the translator's intended meaning and led to multiple comical interpretations for the readers, thus, producing various humorous scripts. 
For example,

(1) A sign in a Chinese Safari Park states "大象在此 请留在车上 Elephants Here Please Stay In Your Car"

The translator intended to refer the general public that are visiting the park as the implicit reference marker of the sign by using the co-referential anaphor 'Your', but failed to do so and instead, the explicit anaphor 'Your' unintentionally picks up 'Elephants' as the textual referent. Thus, this give rise to a humorous script that looks as though that the sign is meant for the elephants and not the people. In addition, this example highlights the importance of having punctuation to serve as a cohesion device because if the translator were to put a full stop or exclamation point after the word 'Elephants', the anaphor 'your' would have been interpreted literally for the readers. Therefore, it would have also ruled out any possibilities of humorous reading.

(2) An article in Soviet Weekly reports "There will be a Moscow Exhibition of Arts by 15,000 Soviet Republic painters and sculptors. These were executed over the past two years."

Similarly, there is a mishap of the anaphoric reference marker 'these', which to the interpretation of readers, refers to 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Thus, it conveys the idea that they were only executed over the past two years, as a result, generating laughter among readers. In terms of the translator's intentions, the reference marker 'these' actually refers textually to the referent 'Arts' or, perhaps, 'the painters and sculptors' works' and not 'Soviet Republic painters and sculptors'. Hence, this script lacks of an eligible textual referent to accurately bring across the intended message. Although this script is easily decipherable based upon one's basic knowledge, it still did not fail to cause laughter and humor to readers.&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word order ===

Word order is the way in which syntactic constituents of a language arrange itself in a phrase or a sentence. Different languages employ different structures of word order. Direct translation of one language to another may result in wrong placement of a phrase in relation to the other constituents in the sentence. This may cause a change to the initial meaning of the translator and hence, may trigger a humorous script.

| A sign in the lobby of a Moscow hotel across a Russian Orthodox monastery states "Вы можете посетить кладбище, где известные российские и советские композиторы, художники и писатели похоронены ежедневно, кроме четверга. You are welcome to visit the cemetery where famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers are buried daily except Thursday."
|}

Because of to the incorrect placement of the adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ at the end of the sentence, this script generates unintentional humor in its translation. The adverbial phrase ‘daily except Thursday’ became a post-modifier which had misguided the readers into thinking that the script is about the act of burying ‘famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers’, instead of conveying the act of people visiting the cemetery. Apparently, the translator wanted to avoid a possible awkwardness of phrasing the post-modifier after the appropriate act, but was unaware that the parentheses applied would also enclose another awkward and comical adverbial at the same time.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A menu in a Tokyo bar shows, "Special cocktails for the ladies with nuts"
|}

Likewise, the humour in this case is also caused by the wrong placement of the prepositional phrase ‘with nuts’ as a post-modifier of ‘the ladies’ instead of its intended referent ‘cocktails’ as a post-modifier. Although the mishap is triggered by the mistaken word order, which can be changed to "Special cocktails with nuts for the ladies", it would still have remained as an awkward sentence because of the polysemous word ‘nuts’. Thus, if the word ‘nuts’ were to be replaced with ‘cashews’, any humorous translation error would not have been present. Therefore, it should be noted that attachment sites of prepositional phrases are a notorious source of ambiguity in English.&lt;ref&gt;Farghal, M. (2006). Accidental Humor in International Public Notices Displayed in English. Journal of Intercultural Communication, (12), 2. Retrieved from http://immi.se/intercultural/nr12/farghal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario whose main feature place is the {{Nihongo|Dungeon|ダンジョン|Danjon}} which contains an assortment of monsters from goblins to dragons. Adventurers visit the dungeon to defeat monsters and take their crystal shards, which are used to craft magic items, among other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged for the world's currency. The people of Orario join groups called {{Nihongo|Familia|ファミリア|Famiria}}, who serve a range of functions from dungeon crawling to crafting items. Each Familia is named after and serves a resident deity. In a fashion similar to role playing games, the adventurers are grouped into levels, increasing their levels and abilities according to their achievements.&lt;ref name="vol 1"&gt;''Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?'' volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ep1"&gt;''Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon'' anime, episode 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
{{See also|List of Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? characters}}
The story follows the exploits of Bell Cranel, a 15-year-old solo adventurer under the goddess [[Hestia (character)|Hestia]]. As the only member of the Hestia Familia, he works hard every day in the dungeon to make ends meet while seeking to improve himself. He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman who once saved his life, and with whom he fell in love. He is unaware that several other girls, deities and mortals alike, also develop affections towards him; most notably Hestia herself, as he also gains allies and improves himself with each new challenge he faces.

 |ShortSummary    = [[Deity|Gods]] who created the [[Universe]] descended from [[Heaven]] to live among humans on the condition they swore to never again use their godly powers. The Gods only remaining power is the Blessing, which they grant to humans to level up their powers (Similar to how characters level up in video games). These humans, known as Familia, become that God's family. Bell Cranel, the only member of the Goddess [[Hestia]]'s Familia, is almost killed by a [[Minotaur]]. He is saved by Aiz Wallenstein, a high-level adventurer and member of the Familia of the Goddess [[Loki]], and falls in love with her. Hestia realises he has gained the magical skill Realis Phrase, which will raise his level rapidly based on the strength of his feelings as he fights, but decides to keep it secret as it makes him very valuable and other Gods may try to acquire him. The next day, after more adventuring, Bell's stats rise dramatically. Bell plans on talking to Aiz but he overhears another Familia talking about how he embarrassed himself fighting the Minotaur. Realising how pathetic he must seem compared to Aiz, he runs off and absentmindedly enters the dungeon. To let off some steam, he desperately slays as many monsters as he can and returns to Hestia in the morning, beaten and bleeding.

 |ShortSummary    = Hestia continues to keep Realis Phrase secret from Bell, passing off his improvement as the result of hard work, and announces she will be gone for several days. Hestia seeks out the God of Smiths, [[Hephaestus|Hephaistos]]   and begs her to forge a weapon for Bell. After hours of grovelling in the [[Dogeza]] position Hestia convinces Hephaistos to forge a weapon, on condition Hestia pays for it no matter how many centuries it takes. Hephaistos forge an enchanted [[Tantō]] for Bell. Bell is asked by the maids of the Hostess of Fertility Pub to return a purse to Syr, a waitress with a crush on Bell, who got so excited about the festival she forgot it. An unnamed Goddess contacts Loki trying to locate a Familia she intends on acquiring, the description of whom matches Bell perfectly. Hestia locates Bell and insists they go on a romantic date. The unnamed Goddess releases a captured [[Albinism|albino]] gorilla monster, ordering it to capture Bell. It corners Hestia and Bell, who attacks it with his original knife only for it to shatter. Desperate to protect Hestia he locks her on the other side of a metal gate and prepares to fight the gorilla unarmed.

 |ShortSummary    = Flashbacks show how Bell decided to become an adventurer after his grandfather was killed by a monster, eventually meeting Hestia and becoming her Familia. The God [[Ganesha]], whose arena the gorilla was freed from orders it recaptured before it harms innocent people, even asking other Familia for help. Hestia eventually finds her way back to Bell and they flee the Gorilla together. Hestia gives Bell the Tanto she names the Hestia Knife, a living weapon enchanted to grow more powerful the stronger Bell becomes. As Bell holds the weapon for the first time his stat level rises dramatically and he kills the Gorilla in a matter of seconds. His deed is witnessed by dozens of people, including Ais, who smiles before walking away. Hestia suddenly faints with the unknown Goddess who released the Gorilla watching, implying it was her doing. As Hestia recovers Bell realises the Hestia Knife was forged by Hephaistos, meaning it was incredibly expensive and he swears to keep having faith in Hestia. Meanwhile, in the dungeon Adventurer Ged Raish is shown mistreating a young girl named Liliruca Arde, forcing her to carry his equipment and threatening to let monsters kill her if she disappoints him.

Bell becomes flustered when Eina turns up dressed for a date. Bell comes across Hestia working to pay her debt to Hephaistos. Hestia becomes jealous of Eina. Bell purchases [[Plate armour|armour]] made by a blacksmith he has never heard of. Eina gives him extra wrist armour. Bell saves Liliruca from Ged, but she disappears. Liliruca reappears, revealing herself to be a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]], and offers her services as a supporter only to then steal the Hestia Knife. She attempts to sell it but finds that when separated from Bell it becomes blunt and worthless. She is spotted carrying the knife by Ryuu Lion, a waitress from Hostess of Fertility. Liliruca runs away and bumps into Bell. With his knife returned and unaware Liliruca had tried to steal it Bell splits the money they earned evenly with her, shocking her as all her previous partners had paid her almost nothing. Ais is seen in the dungeon preparing to fight a powerful monster while the unknown Goddess, revealed to be [[Freyja|Freya]], watches Bell. Hestia is devastated when she sees Bell with Liliruca.

As she arrives for their date she finds that Demeter has spread the gossip far and wide and Bell is mobbed by multiple Goddesses eager to meet Hestia’s very first “boyfriend”. As a result they spend most of the day avoiding detection. Liliruca has the money Bell gave her taken by members of her Souma Familia and becomes determined to steal Bell’s knife, though she becomes even more confused as Bell continues to treat her kindly. After reading a book on magic he borrowed from Syr, Bell learns the Firebolt spell. He rushes to the dungeon to test his new ability but being unfamiliar with magic he overexerts himself into unconsciousness. Ais finds him and puts his head in her lap until he wakes up. Once he does he flees, having embarrassed himself in front of her again. While looking for Liliruca Bell refuses an offer from Ged to make a profit by stealing the money Liliruca had managed to save for herself by hiding it from the Souma Familia.

The Loki Familia discover that the Souma Familia have ceased worshipping their god and begun brewing a powerful wine so addictive other adventurers hand over their entire fortunes for a taste. Ais, who is attracted to Bell, has been depressed since he ran away from her again. Eina, suspicious of Liliruca, asks Ais for a favour. In the dungeon Liliruca tricks Bell into fighting powerful monsters and steals his knife again. She is caught by Ged who is suddenly betrayed by the Souma Familia. Ged is killed and Liliruca is forced to surrender her bank key before being left to be killed by monster ants. Bell suddenly appears and saves her. Ais had hidden in thick fog to kill the monsters attacking Bell without him seeing her. Liliruca cries and admits to every time she cheated or stole from him. Despite this, Bell forgives her and they form a true partnership. Ais, who believes she scared Bell into running away, is mad at herself for forgetting to apologise to him. She finds a piece of his armour he lost during the fight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19582">{{Redirect|Invalid proof|any type of invalid proof besides mathematics|Fallacy}}
In [[mathematics]], certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept of '''mathematical fallacy'''. There is a distinction between a simple ''mistake'' and a ''mathematical fallacy'' in a proof: a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof just in the same way, but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example, the reason validity fails may be a [[division by zero]] that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a certain quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] of obvious [[contradiction]]s. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and are not applicable in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.

The traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of [[fallacy]] is here slightly different from the [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]]. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of [[Pasch's axiom]] of [[Euclidean geometry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[five color theorem|five colour theorem]] of [[graph theory]]). ''Pseudaria'', an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to [[Euclid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|Helberg|1908|loc=Chapter II, §I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics.  In [[elementary algebra]], typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a [[root of a function|root]] is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a [[multiple valued function]] are equated.  Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and [[calculus]].

==Howlers==

Examples exist of mathematically correct results derived by incorrect lines of reasoning. Such an argument, however true the conclusion, is mathematically [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] and is commonly known as a ''howler''. For example, the calculation ([[anomalous cancellation]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{16}{64} = \frac{16\!\!\!/}{6\!\!\!/4}=\frac{1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
Although the conclusion &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; is correct, there is a fallacious, invalid cancellation in the middle step. &lt;ref&gt;The same fallacy also applies to&lt;math&gt; \frac{19}{95} = \frac{19\!\!\!/}{9\!\!\!/5} = \frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt; , to &lt;math&gt;\frac{26}{65} = \frac{26\!\!\!/}{6\!\!\!/5} = \frac{2}{5}&lt;/math&gt;, and to &lt;math&gt;\frac{49}{98} = \frac{49\!\!\!/}{9\!\!\!/8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another classical example of a howler is [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem#A bogus .22proof.22: p.28A.29 .3D det.28AIn.C2.A0.E2.88.92.C2.A0A.29 .3D det.28A.C2.A0.E2.88.92.C2.A0A.29 .3D 0|proving the Cayley-Hamilton theorem]] by simply substituting the scalar variables of the characteristic polynomial by the matrix.

Bogus proofs, calculations, or derivations constructed to produce a correct result in spite of incorrect logic or operations were termed "howlers" by Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the field of mathematics the term ''[[Howler (error)|howler]]'' has various meanings, generally less specific.

== Division by zero ==
The [[Division by zero|division-by-zero fallacy]] has many variants. The following example uses division by zero to "prove" that &lt;math&gt;2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but can be modified to prove that any number equals any other number.

# Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be equal, non-zero quantities
#:&lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Multiply by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = ab&lt;/math&gt;
# Subtract &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Factorization|Factor]] both sides: the left factors as a [[difference of squares]], the right is factored by extracting &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both terms
#:&lt;math&gt;(a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide out &lt;math&gt;(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a + b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Observing that &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;b + b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Combine like terms on the left
#:&lt;math&gt;2b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide by the non-zero &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

''[[Q.E.D.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Harro|last=Heuser|title=Lehrbuch der Analysis - Teil 1|edition=6th|publisher=Teubner|year=1989|isbn=978-3-8351-0131-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallacy is in line 5: the progression from line 4 to line 5 involves division by ''a'' − ''b'', which is zero since ''a'' equals ''b''. Since [[division by zero]] is undefined, the argument is invalid.

== Multivalued functions ==
{{Main article |Multivalued function}}
Many functions do not have a unique [[inverse function|inverse]]. For instance, while squaring a number gives a unique value, there are two possible [[square root]]s of a positive number. The square root is [[multivalued function|multivalued]]. One value can be chosen by convention as the [[principal value]]; in the case of the square root the non-negative value is the principal value, but there is no guarantee that the square root given as the principal value of the square of a number will be equal to the original number; e.g. the principal square root of the square of −2 is 2.

==Calculus==
[[Calculus]] as the mathematical study of infinitesimal change and [[limit of a function|limits]] can lead to mathematical fallacies if the properties of [[integral]]s and [[differential (mathematics)|differentials]] are ignored. For instance, a naive use of [[integration by parts]] can be used to give a false proof that 0 = 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ed|last=Barbeau|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=21|number=3|year=1990|pages=216–218|title=Fallacies, Flaws and Flimflam #19: Dolt's Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letting &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u = \frac{1}{\log x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle dv = \frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we may write:

: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 1 + \int \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

after which the antiderivatives may be cancelled yielding 0 = 1. The problem is that antiderivatives are only defined up to a constant and shifting them by 1 or indeed any number is allowed. The error really comes to light when we introduce arbitrary integration limits ''a'' and ''b''.

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 1 |_a^b + \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 0 + \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Since the difference between two values of a constant function vanishes, the same definite integral appears on both sides of the equation.

==Power and root==
Fallacies involving disregarding the rules of elementary [[arithmetic]] through an incorrect manipulation of the [[nth root|radical]].

=== Positive and negative roots ===

Care must be taken when taking the [[square root]] of both sides of an [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]. Failing to do so results in a proof of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Fun, Games and Puzzles |edition=illustrated |first1=Jack |last1=Frohlichstein |publisher=Courier Corporation |year=1967 |isbn=0-486-20789-7 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7CVzMosF-kC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=w7CVzMosF-kC&amp;pg=PA207 Extract of page 207]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;5 = 4.&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
:Start from
::&lt;math&gt;-20 = -20&lt;/math&gt;
:Write this as
::&lt;math&gt;25-45 = 16-36&lt;/math&gt;
:Rewrite as
::&lt;math&gt;5^2-5\times9 = 4^2-4\times9&lt;/math&gt;
:Add &lt;math&gt;81/4&lt;/math&gt; on both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5^2-5\times9+81/4 = 4^2-4\times9+81/4&lt;/math&gt;
:These are perfect squares:
::&lt;math&gt;(5-9/2)^2 = (4-9/2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:Take the square root of both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5-9/2 = 4-9/2&lt;/math&gt;
:Add &lt;math&gt;9/2&lt;/math&gt; on both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5 = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:''[[Q.E.D.]]''

The fallacy is in the second to last line, where the square root of both sides is taken: ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; only implies ''a'' = ''b'' if ''a'' and ''b'' have the same sign, which is not the case here. In this case it implies ''a'' = –''b'' and should read '''5-9/2 = -(4-9/2)''', which, by adding '''9/2''' on both sides, correctly reduces to '''5 = 5'''.

As another example of the danger of taking the square root of both sides of an equation, consider the fundamental identity&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter VI, §I.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos^2x=1-\sin^2x&lt;/math&gt;
which holds as a consequence of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Then, by taking a square root,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \sqrt{1-\sin^2x}&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;1+\cos x = 1+\sqrt{1-\sin^2x}.&lt;/math&gt;
But evaluating this when ''x'' = π implies
:&lt;math&gt;1-1 = 1+\sqrt{1-0}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;0=2&lt;/math&gt;
which is incorrect.

The error in each of these examples fundamentally lies in the fact that any equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a^2&lt;/math&gt;
has two solutions, provided ''a'' ≠ 0,
:&lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;
and it is essential to check which of these solutions is relevant to the problem at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter VI, §II}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the above fallacy, the square root that allowed the second equation to be deduced from the first is valid only when cos ''x'' is positive.  In particular, when ''x'' is set to π, the second equation is rendered invalid.

===Squaring both sides of an equation===

When both sides of an equation are squared, sometimes solutions are induced that were not present in the original equation.

An example of this kind of fallacy, is the following invalid proof that &lt;math&gt;-2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;:
:Let
::&lt;math&gt;x = -2.&lt;/math&gt; 
:Squaring gives
::&lt;math&gt;x^2 =  4&lt;/math&gt;
:whereupon taking a square root implies
::&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{4} = 2,&lt;/math&gt;
:so that
::&lt;math&gt;x = -2 = 2, &lt;/math&gt;
:which is absurd. 
When the square root was extracted, it was the ''negative'' root &amp;minus;2, rather than the ''positive'' root, that was relevant for the particular solution in the problem.

=== Square roots of negative numbers ===

Invalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often of the following kind:
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=i \cdot i = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

The fallacy is that the rule &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; is generally valid only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are positive (when dealing with real numbers), which is not the case here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of "i" [the square root of minus one] |first1=Paul J. |last1=Nahin |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4008-3029-9 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PflwJdPhBlEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PflwJdPhBlEC&amp;pg=PA12 Extract of page 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, imaginary roots are obfuscated in the following:

:&lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1} = (-1)^\frac{2}{4} = ((-1)^2)^\frac{1}{4} = 1^\frac{1}{4} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The error here lies in the last equality, where we are ignoring the other fourth roots of 1,&lt;ref&gt;In general, the expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{1}&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to ''n'' complex numbers, called the [[Root of unity|''n''th roots of unity]].&lt;/ref&gt; which are −1, ''i'' and −''i'' (where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]). Since we have squared our figure and then taken roots, we cannot always assume that all the roots will be correct. So the correct fourth roots are ''i'' and −''i'', which are the imaginary numbers defined to square to −1.

=== Complex exponents ===
When a number is raised to a complex power, the result is not uniquely defined (see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|Failure of power and logarithm identities]]). If this property is not recognized, then errors such as the following can result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{2 \pi i} &amp;= 1 \\
(e^{2 \pi i})^{i} &amp;= 1^{i} \\
e^{-2 \pi} &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The error here is that the rule of multiplying exponents as when going to the third line does not apply unmodified with complex exponents, even if when putting both sides to the power {{math|''i''}} only the principal value is chosen.  When treated as [[multivalued function]]s, both sides produce the same set of values, being {{math|1={e&lt;sup&gt;2''πn''&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} ''n'' ∈ ℤ} }}.

== Geometry ==
Many mathematical fallacies in [[geometry]] arise from using in an additive equality involving oriented quantities (such adding vectors along a given line or adding oriented angles in the plane) a valid identity, but which fixes only the absolute value of (one of) these quantities. This quantity is then incorporated into the equation with the wrong orientation, so as to produce an absurd conclusion. This wrong orientation is usually suggested implicitly by supplying an imprecise diagram of the situation, where relative positions of points or lines are chosen in a way that is actually impossible under the hypotheses of the argument, but non-obviously so. Such a fallacy is easy to expose by drawing a precise picture of the situation, in which some relative positions will be different from those in the provided diagram. In order to avoid such fallacies, a correct geometric argument using addition or subtraction of distances or angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct orientation.

=== Fallacy of the isosceles triangle ===
[[File:Fallacy of the isosceles triangle2.svg|thumb]]
The fallacy of the isosceles triangle, from {{harv|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter II, § 1}}, purports to show that every [[triangle]] is [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], meaning that two sides of the triangle are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. This fallacy has been attributed to [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Lewis Carroll in Numberland| author=Robin Wilson| pages=169–170| publisher=Penguin Books| isbn=978-0-14-101610-8| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a triangle △ABC, prove that AB = AC:
# Draw a line [[bisection|bisecting]] ∠A
# Draw the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, which bisects BC at a point D
# Let these two lines meet at a point O.
# Draw line OR perpendicular to AB, line OQ perpendicular to AC
# Draw lines OB and OC
# By [[solution of triangles|AAS]], △RAO ≅ △QAO (∠ORA = ∠OQA = 90°; ∠RAO = ∠QAO; AO = AO (common side))
# By [[congruence (geometry)|RHS]],&lt;ref&gt;Hypotenuse-leg congruence&lt;/ref&gt; △ROB ≅ △QOC (∠BRO = ∠CQO = 90°; BO = OC (hypotenuse); RO = OQ (leg))
# Thus, AR = AQ, RB = QC, and AB = AR + RB = AQ + QC = AC
''Q.E.D.''

As a corollary, one can show that all triangles are equilateral, by showing that AB = BC and AC = BC in the same way.

The error in the proof is the assumption in the diagram that the point O is ''inside'' the triangle.  In fact, O always lies at the circumcircle of the △ABC (except for isosceles and equilateral triangles where AO and OD coincide).  Furthermore, it can be shown that, if AB is longer than AC, then R will lie ''within'' AB, while Q will lie ''outside'' of AC (and vice versa).  (Any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two facts.)  Because of this, AB is still AR + RB, but AC is actually AQ − QC; and thus the lengths are not necessarily the same.

== Proof by induction ==
There exist several fallacious [[Proof by induction|proofs by induction]] in which one of the components, basis case or inductive step, is incorrect. Intuitively, proofs by induction work by arguing that, if a statement is true in one case, it is true in the next case, and hence by repeatedly applying this it can be shown to be true for all cases. This "proof" shows that [[all horses are the same colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Induction and Analogy in Mathematics | series=Mathematics and plausible reasoning |volume=1 |first = George | last=Pólya | author-link=George Pólya| year=1954 |page=120 | publisher=Princeton}} (The original was that any n girls have the same colour eyes).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Let us say that any group of N horses is all of the same colour.
# If we remove a horse from the group, we have a group of N - 1 horses of the same colour. If we add another horse, we have another group of N horses. By our previous assumption, all the horses are of the same colour in this new group, since it is a group of N horses.
# Thus we have constructed two groups of N horses all of the same colour, with N - 1 horses in common. Since these two groups have some horses in common, the two groups must be of the same colour as each other.
# Therefore, combining all the horses used, we have a group of N + 1 horses of the same colour.
# Thus if any N horses are all the same colour, any N + 1 horses are the same colour.
# This is clearly true for N = 1 (i.e. one horse is a group where all the horses are the same colour). Thus, by induction, N horses are the same colour for any positive integer N. i.e. all horses are the same colour.

The fallacy in this proof arises in line 3. For N = 1, the two groups of horses have N − 1 = 0 horses in common, and thus are not necessarily the same colour as each other, so the group of N + 1 = 2 horses is not necessarily all of the same colour. The implication "Every N horses are of the same colour, then N+1 horses are of the same colour" works for any N greater than one, but fails to be true when N = 1. The basis case is correct, but the induction step has a fundamental flaw. If we were additionally given the fact that any two horses shared the same colour, we could correctly induct from the base case of N = 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4195">'''Media monitoring''' is the activity of monitoring the output of the print, online and broadcast media.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It can be conducted for a variety of reasons, including political, commercial, scientific, and so on.

==In business==
In the commercial sphere, this activity is usually carried out in house or by a [[media monitoring service]], a private company that provides such services to other companies, organisations and individuals on a [[subscription]] basis.

The services that media monitoring companies provide typically include the systematic recording of radio and television broadcasts, the collection of press clippings from print media publications,  the collection of data from online information sources. The material collected usually consists of any media output that makes reference to the client, its activities and/or its designated topics of interests. The monitoring of online consumer sources such as [[blogs]], [[Internet forum|forums]] and [[social networks]] is more specifically known as [[buzz monitoring]] which informs the company of how its service or product is perceived by users.

While monitoring social media it can be beneficial for a company to respond to as many posts as possible.  Not all comments will be positive ones, but it is good for the customers to know they are being heard.  It is also important to keep in mind to avoid deleting any unfavorable content from a social media page you control.  You should assume that something on the Internet was seen by at least one person, no matter how quickly you delete it.  Deleting the comment can make the company look even worse and give the idea of a cover-up which implies guilt on the company’s part.

Most media monitoring is done within private public relations agencies or businesses in house public relations sectors. Publicists will track the number of times the company was mentioned within different platforms.  Some of the main platforms include magazines, newspaper, blogs, and social media.  These entries are referred to as “clippings” and are compiled into monthly reports by the Public Relations firm.  These clippings are then presented to the client along with the circulation and impressions from these platforms.  Circulation is how many subscribers or viewers the platform has, and impressions are calculated by multiplying the circulation by three.  Impressions are only calculated for print media because it is assumed print media will be circulated past the original subscribers.  These figures are calculated to show the client approximately how many people their message has reached.  Media monitoring is a beneficial tool to evaluate the efforts and progress of a PR firm.

==In social sciences==
In academia media monitoring is deployed by social scientists in an attempt to discover e.g. biases in the way the same event is presented in different media, among the media of different countries etc. The use of large scale monitoring techniques by computer scientists enabled the exploration of different aspects of the media system such as the visualisation of the media-sphere,&lt;ref&gt;I. Flaounas, M. Turchi, T. De Bie, and N. Cristianini,  "Inference and Validation of Networks",  ECML/PKDD, Bled, Slovenia, Springer, pp. 344–358, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the sentimental and objectivity analysis of news content&lt;ref&gt;N. Godbole,M. Srinivasaiah, S. Skiena, "Large-Scale Sentiment Analysis for News and Blogs", Int. Conf. on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2007), Denver CO, March 26–28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==Technologies involved==
Media monitoring is practically achieved by a combination of technologies—including audio and video recording, [[text mining|high speed text scanners and text recognition software]]—and human readers and analysts. The automation of the process is highly desirable and can be partially achieved by deploying [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] techniques.

'''Nuit Blanche''' ({{IPA-fr|nɥi ˈblɑ̃ʃ}}) ('''White Night''') is an annual all-night or night-time [[arts festival]]. A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public [[art gallery|art galleries]], and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a ''de facto'' art gallery, providing space for [[art installation]]s, performances (music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkabilly.ca/nuit-blanche-2016-toronto-punk-show/|title=Nuit Blanche Punk Rock Show|publisher=punkabilly.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.

==History==

In 1989, the [[Helsinki Festival]] established its [[Night of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginjuhlaviikot.fi/en/taiteiden-yo|title=Taiteiden yö|work=Helsingin juhlaviikot}}&lt;/ref&gt; "when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofestivals.co.uk/festivals-in-finland/helsinki-festival/|title=Helsinki Festival|publisher=eurofestivals.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the mayor of Nantes, [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]]'s program included renovating the central city and establishing a "contemporary patrimony", which led arts programmer [[Jean Blaise]] to create a late-night cultural festival, "Les Allumées" ("Things Alight").&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf Alliance Française of New Zealand, May 2009 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325211624/http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, over six years with artists from six cities.&lt;ref name="Nantes"&gt;[http://www.nantes.fr/les-allumees Les Allumées (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear left}}

They were as follows:
* [[Barcelona]], 15–20 October 1990
* [[St. Petersburg]], 14–19 October 1991
* [[Buenos Aires]], 19–24 October 1992
* [[Naples]], 18–23 October 1993
* [[Cairo]], 17–22 October 1994
* [[Havana]], 16–21 October 1995. (The Cuban government refused to issue travel documents to the 300 artists expected, so the event was formally cancelled, though events did take place.)&lt;ref name="Nantes"/&gt;

In 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual [[White Nights Festival]] in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included [[popular culture|pop culture]] (e.g. the [[Rolling Stones]] in the open air at [[Palace Square]]) in 2007 and [[high culture]] events ("Stars of the White Nights Festival" at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] under [[Valery Gergiev]]) every year since 1993.

In 1997, the [[Long Night of Museums]], took place in the [[German reunification|newly re-united]] [[Berlin]] with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.

In 2001, when [[Bertrand Delanoë]] became [[Mayor of Paris]], his deputy, Christophe Girard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christophe-girard.fr/a-propos/|title=Présentation|work=christophe-girard.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 History of Nuit Blanche (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906073353/http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. "The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/english/visit/highlights/nuit-blanche/rub_8208_stand_34123_port_18969|title=Nuit Blanche|author=Mairie de Paris|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as "Nuits Blanches Europe". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutrio.be/nuit-blanche-9th-edition-0|title=Nuit blanche – 9th edition – Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union|work=eutrio.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Melbourne]] hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, [[Melbourne laneways|laneways]], shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/4156-white-night-melbourne-celebrating-our-city-from-dusk-to-dawn.html?qh=YTozOntpOjA7czo1OiJ3aGl0ZSI7aToxO3M6Nzoid2hpdGVseSI7aToyO3M6Nzoid2hpdGluZyI7fQ%3D%3D Premier of Victoria's Press Release: White Night Melbourne – celebrating our city from dusk to dawn]&lt;/ref&gt; This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/white-night-an-arty-delight-20130224-2ezot.html|title=White Night an arty delight|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-avignon.org/en/contribution-nuit-blanche-made-paris-concept-exported-latin-america-margot-beck|title=Contribution: "Nuit Blanche, the made in Paris concept exported in Latin America" by Margot Beck – Forum d'Avignon|publisher=forum-avignon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the "Noche en Blanco" was made between 2013 and 2015.

== Summary ==

Onsen Musume are minor goddesses who live in every [[onsen]]. During the day Onsen Musume go to school in [[Odaiba]], Tokyo to learn how to help more people learn about each Musume's respective onsen, and also to learn special arts that help guests relax and smile.

One day they receive a proclamation from Sunahiko, the god who rules over all of the onsen, commanding them to become [[Japanese idol|idols]]. The Onsen Musume form idol groups in order to compete in the newly-created idol tournament.

The main character of the series is Yuina Kusatsu, the Onsen Musume for [[Kusatsu Onsen]]. With eight other Onsen Musume, she forms an idol group called "SPRiNGS". In school the nine members are known as the "weird ones", but as idols they aim to become the best Onsen Musume idol group in Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://soranews24.com/2017/03/21/onsen-musume-japanese-hot-springs-turn-into-cute-anime-schoolgirl-idols%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/|title=Onsen Musume: Japanese hot springs turn into cute anime schoolgirl idols【Video】|date=2017-03-21|work=SoraNews24|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔːpera|lang}}; English plural: ''operas''; Italian plural: ''opere'' {{IPA-it|ˈɔːpere|}}) is a form of [[theatre]] in which [[music]] has a leading role and the parts are taken by [[Singing|singers]].&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "work" (the literal translation of "opera") is typically a collaboration between a [[composer]] and a [[libretto|librettist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wagner]] and [[Arrigo Boito]] are notable creators who combined both roles.&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates a number of the [[performing arts]], such as [[acting]], [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[costume]], and sometimes [[dance]] or [[ballet]]. The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].

Opera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called "opera" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theater]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Opéra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"&gt;[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].

[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberflöte''), landmarks in the German tradition.

The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].

==Operatic terminology==

The words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally "small book"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as "[[number opera]]", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"/&gt; and [[aria]] (an "air" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[opéra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].&lt;ref&gt;General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed "endless melody". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].

==History==

===Origins===
{{Main article|Origins of opera}}
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]
The Italian word ''opera'' means "work", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning "work" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense "composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]".&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the "chorus" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of "restoring" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual "opera singers"; [[Madama Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 "From 1587–1600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian opera===
{{Main article|Italian opera}}

====Baroque era====
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Vivaldi]],  in 1723]]

[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]

Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" ([[Carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].
Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera." One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.

''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of [[opera seria]] include [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opera seria]] had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 [[Melchior Grimm]] published "{{Lang|fr|Poème lyrique}}", an influential article for the [[Encyclopédie]] on [[lyric poetry|lyric]] and opera [[libretto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/musdico/Grimm/167991 Larousse ''Dictionnaire de la musique'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment|first= Downing A|last= Thomas|page= 148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zct2C3-jaAC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0521473071|date= 1995-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgrFMhZy3aAC&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=Lully Studies|first=John Hajdu|last=Heyer|date=7 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0521621830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SqdTxG3jUNMC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=A History of Western Musical Aesthetics|first=Edward A.|last=Lippman|date=26 November 1992|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0803279513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/music/research/proj/esf/pos/sem1.aspx|title=King's College London –  Seminar 1|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers of the period, including [[Niccolò Jommelli]] and [[Tommaso Traetta]], attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a "beautiful simplicity". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.

Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====
[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]
The [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally "beautiful singing", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.

Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be "an unending string of duets". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first "realistic" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner – Various articles – Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Verdi, the sentimental "realistic" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

===German-language opera===
{{Main article|German opera}}
[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Die Sternenhalle der Königin der Nacht Bühnenbild Zauberflöte Mozart.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Queen of the Night in an 1815 production of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'']]
The first German opera was ''[[Dafne (Opitz-Schütz)|Dafne]]'', composed by [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Singspiele'', ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (1782) and ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].

Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a "complete work of art"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of "endless melody". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.

Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/operetta.htm A History of The Musical: European Operetta 1850–1880]. Musicals101.com&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly [[Vienna|Viennese]] flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.

In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] at the court of [[King Louis XIV]]. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Académie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[tragédie en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[tragédie en musique|tragédies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[opéra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Italian+opera+not+popular+in+france#v=onepage&amp;q=Italian%20opera%20not%20popular%20in%20france&amp;f=false |title=A Short History of Opera |isbn=978-0231119580 |accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout |first1=Donald Jay |last2=Grout |first2=Donald |last3=Williams |first3=Hermine Weigel |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[opéra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[André Grétry|Grétry]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[Méhul]] and [[Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly "comic" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[François Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la République'' (1793).
[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Kožená]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]

By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''opéra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Boïeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand Hérold|Hérold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.

In the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Léo Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Saëns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakmé]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.

Other notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–4, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century ''jig''. This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), "the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo".&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite&gt;[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Molière]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.

Blow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.

[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]
Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced "a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated".
[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]
Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.

The only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of "English" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as "a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, "The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly. ...we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." (quoted at p. 312 in Allen, Reginald (1975). ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan''. London: Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&amp;S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's ''[[La bohème]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].

In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Adès]] continue to export English opera abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[André Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]].

===Russian opera===
{{Main article|Russian opera}}
[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]
Opera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].

However, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.

In the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'écume des jours (opera)|L'écume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (opera)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard: Russia in 'The New Grove Dictionary of Opera', ed.

===Other national operas===
[[File:Prodana Nevesta Cover 1919.JPG|thumb|Score of Smetana's ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'']]
Spain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as [[zarzuela]], which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.

Czech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bedřich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Antonín Dvořák]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leoš Janáček]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jenůfa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[Káťa Kabanová]]''.

In Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813–1873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.

[[File:Erkel Ferenc Györgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]
The key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are ''[[Hunyadi László (opera)|Hunyadi László]]'' and ''[[Bánk bán]]''. The most famous modern Hungarian opera is [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''.

[[Stanisław Moniuszko]]'s opera ''[[The Haunted Manor|Straszny Dwór]]'' (in English ''The Haunted Manor'') (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of [[Polish opera|Polish national opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter on "Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Opera to 1900" by John Tyrrell in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included ''[[King Roger]]'' by [[Karol Szymanowski]] and ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].

The first known opera from [[Turkey]] (the [[Ottoman Empire]]) was ''[[Arshak II (opera)|Arshak II]]'', which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer [[Tigran Tchoukhajian]] in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.

The first years of the [[Soviet Union]] saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the ''[[Koroğlu (opera)|Koroğlu]]'' (1937) by the [[Azerbaijan]]i composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]]. The first [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] opera, ''Ai-Churek'', premiered in Moscow at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by [[Vladimir Vlasov]], [[Abdylas Maldybaev]] and [[Vladimir Fere]]. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov.

In Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was ''[[La púrpura de la rosa]]'', by [[Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco]], although ''[[Partenope (Zumaya)|Partenope]]'', by the Mexican [[Manuel de Zumaya]], was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was ''A Noite de São João'', by [[Elias Álvares Lobo]]. However, [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]''. Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires—with the opera ''[[Aurora (opera)|Aurora]]'', by [[Ettore Panizza]], being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include [[Felipe Boero]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]].

===Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends===

====Modernism====
Perhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of [[atonality]]. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.

[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Schönberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Operatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].

The two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.
[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]
Composers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.--&gt;

However, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walton, "Neo-classical opera" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: "a burlesque in song and dance") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: "to be read, played, and danced"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}&lt;!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --&gt; other composers.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other trends====
A common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.

Another feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.

The Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a "patchwork quilt" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. [[Opera Carolina]] offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ Opera Carolina discount information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221220758/http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ |date=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences. Since 2006, the Met has broadcast live performances to several hundred movie screens all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/broadcast/hd_events_alternates.aspx|title = On Air &amp; On Line: 2007–08 HD Season|accessdate = 10 April 2008|year = 2007|publisher = The Metropolitan Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From musicals back towards opera====
By the late 1930s, some [[musical theatre|musicals]] began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]]. Other [[rock musical|rock influenced musicals]], such as ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1971), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), and ''[[Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as [[through composed|through composition]], recitative instead of dialogue, and [[leitmotif]]s.

===Acoustic enhancement in opera===
A subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).&lt;ref&gt;Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 "Opera's Dirty Little Secret"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operatic voices==
Operatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.

===Vocal classifications===
Singers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the "female" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.

Yet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[Basso Buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.

A particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Cornélie Falcon|falcon]]''.

===Historical use of voice parts===
:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.

The soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing "witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]" roles. In recent years many of the "trouser roles" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.

The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Così fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation "baritone" was not standard until the mid-19th century.

===Famous singers===
[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]
Early performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739–1793) was a leading example.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed. Parker, 1994), Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Though opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Amelita Galli-Curci]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Juan Arvizu]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mexican+musicians+in+California+and+the+United+States%2C+1910-50.-a0155283831 ''The Free Library – Mexican Musicians in California and the United States 1910–50 – Two Mexican Tenors'' – Juan Arvizu opera tenor in thefreelibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lzmTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:sZtJSSJbdm4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sOe62dXZAhXPct8KHYJeCmcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan%20Arvizu&amp;f=false ''Agustin Lara: A Cultural Biography'' – "Juan Arvizu Biography" – operatic tenor] Andrew Grant Wood.

==Changing role of the orchestra==
Before the 1700s, Italian operas used a small [[string orchestra]], but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the [[basso continuo]] group, which consisted of the [[harpsichord]], "plucked instruments" such as [[lute]] and a bass instrument.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"&gt;John Spitzer. (2009). Orchestra and voice in eighteenth-century Italian opera. In: Anthony R. DelDonna and Pierpaolo Polzonetti (eds.) [[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Eighteenth-Century Opera]]. pp. 112–39. [Online]. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's "...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral [[ritornello]] to mark the end of a singer's solo.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt; During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives "...as special"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt;
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006329 030 Orchester im Orchestergraben.jpg|thumb|right|German opera orchestra from the early 1950s]]
The orchestra has also provided an instrumental [[overture]] before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' opens with a brief instrumental [[ritornello]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) opens with a [[toccata]], in this case a fanfare for muted [[trumpet]]s. The [[French overture]] as found in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s operas&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, George Gow, and James R. Anthony. 2001. "French Overture". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; consist of a slow introduction in a marked "dotted rhythm", followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as [[Giulio Cesare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8fHja-D-FvsC&amp;dq=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture&amp;q=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture#v=snippet&amp;q=Giulio%20Cesare%20French%20overture&amp;f=false |last= Burrows |first = Donald|date = 2012|page = 178|title = Handel|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0199737369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a distinct form called "overture" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. "Italian Overture." ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called "sonatina form" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"/&gt;

In Italian opera after about 1800, the "overture" became known as the ''sinfonia''.&lt;ref name=FISH&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. "Sinfonia". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', four volumes, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]]. London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0333734327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the "symphony before the opera") was "an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work".&lt;ref name=FISH/&gt; In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.

The role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which "...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |url= |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=772 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.

As the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.

==Language and translation issues==
Since the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.&lt;ref&gt;de Acha, Rafael. [http://seenandheard-international.com/2013/09/don-carlos-in-french/ "Don Carlo or Don Carlos? In Italian or in French?"] (Seen and Heard International, 24 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/whose-language-is-opera-the-audiences-or-the-composers/news-story/b8b5ea7dfc230f1eda72a2eb329d1daa|title=Whose language is opera: the audience's or the composer's?|author=[[Lyndon Terracini]]|date=11 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers."The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship," explains mezzo-soprano [[Dolora Zajick]]. "[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/19/291410969/dolora-zajick-singing-is-connected-to-the-body "For Opera Powerhouse Dolora Zajick, 'Singing Is Connected To The Body'"] (Fresh Air, 19 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called [[surtitles]]) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/arts/music/06tomm.html "So That's What the Fat Lady Sang"] (''The New York Times'', 6 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium]] arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.

Today, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the [[English National Opera]], the [[Opera Theater of St. Louis]], [[Opera Theater of Pittsburgh]], and Opera South East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operasoutheast.org.uk/all-past-productions.html "Opera South East's past productions back to 1980...

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Pieces Project''' is an experimental art/ [[comics]] project. It was initiated in 2006 by a Polish artist Jakub Mazerant.&lt;ref&gt;Pieces Project official website http://www.piecesbooks.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces Project involves various artists working on one [[comic book]]. Each artist creates only one panel ("piece") of the story. There is no script provided. The story evolves with each and every panel.

'''Pieces Project - first edition'''

The first edition lasted from 2006 until 2010. 94 international artists contributed to the first edition of the project. The countries involved included: Poland, Japan, USA, Belgium, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, Sweden, France, Chile, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Lithuania. The first edition of the Pieces Project was released in a printed form. 
The "Pieces Project - Pieces Book 1" set an official '''[[Guinness World Record]]''' in October 2013&lt;ref&gt;IllustrateYourself.com Gallery website http://illustrateyourself.com/news/entry/pieces-project-pieces-book-1-guinness-world-record&lt;/ref&gt; in "The most contributors to a published comic book" category.&lt;ref&gt;Culture.pl http://culture.pl/en/article/guinness-world-record-winning-comic&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieces - Project - second edition'''

The second edition was initiated in 2012. This edition is still in progress. There have been almost 100 artists involved.

'''Pieces Project exhibition'''

Both editions of the project were presented during the International Festival of Comics and Games in Lodz (Poland) in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;International Festival of Comics and Games official website http://komiksfestiwal.com/en/comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">'''Platform magic''' (also known as '''parlor magic''', '''club magic''' or '''cabaret magic''') is [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] that is done for larger audiences than [[close-up magic]] and for smaller audiences than [[stage magic]]. It is more intimate than stage magic because it doesn't require expensive, large-scale stage equipment and can thus be performed closer to the audience and without a stage. Many of the tricks performed by platform magicians are sufficiently angle-sensitive as to make them impossible to perform as [[micromagic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magic Tricks for Grown-Ups | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books | author=Tremaine, Jon | year=2006 | location=New York, New York | pages=80–81 | isbn=0-312-34940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most working magicians are parlor/platform magicians.

Many magicians consider the term "parlor" to be old-fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by [[T.A. Waters]], "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance."

Parlor, or club, magicians generally work without assistants and within a few miles of their homes (unlike stage magicians, who may have several in their crew – both backstage and on stage – and may travel thousands of miles between jobs).  This is because payment is less for parlor magicians (but still generally more than for close-up performers). Performances of this category of magic include civic and fraternal organizations, business groups, private parties, youth groups, church societies, public dinners, and similar venues.

Common platform magic tricks include the "[[Miser's Dream]]" (where a seemingly endless supply of coins is produced from thin air), sucker tricks (like the "die box", where a giant die is put in a two-compartment box; the magician makes it vanish but the audience believe he simply shifts it to the other compartment; eventually the magician opens both sides of the box and the die is gone; it has appeared in a previously-empty hat); audience participation tricks (like the breakaway wand, where a wand remains rigid for the magician but falls apart every time the volunteer touches it); production effects (like the square circle, in which a bottomless, topless box with a screened front encloses a bottomless, topless cylinder. Both are shown empty and put together again; the magician then produces large quantities of silk scarves, fruit, bottles, and so on from the "empty" cylinder, inside the square box); and so on. There are countless effects that could be considered as fitting into this classification.

== Platform magicians ==
Platform magicians are not as well known to the general public as stage magicians such as [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and [[Lance Burton]]. Some better-known ones include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21773">Much of [[film]] as an art form grew out of several earlier traditions in the fields of [[oral storytelling]] and [[literature]] (relating to the [[screenplay]]), [[theatre]] (relating to the [[theatre director]]/[[film director]], a [[Cast member|cast]] of [[actor]]s, a [[production team]] that can include a [[set designer|scenic or set designer]], [[lighting designer]], [[costume designer]]) and [[visual art]]. Especially after the [[silent film]] era [[sound design]] and [[music]] (relating to the [[soundtrack]] and [[film score]]) became important factors.

The [[technology]] of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of [[projector|projection]], [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, [[photography]] and [[optics]], with [[sound recording and reproduction]] becoming an important part of film after the silent film era.

'''Precursors of film''' are often referred to as '''precinema''', or 'pre-cinema'. Terms like these are disliked by several historians, partly because they seem to devalue the individual qualities of these media by presenting them as a small step in the development of a later invention.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.telenet.be/thomasweynants/opticaltoys.html&lt;/ref&gt; For instance: the flip book, zoetrope and phenakistiscope are very tactile devices that allow study and play by manipulating the motion by hand, while the projected image in cinema is untangible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Doane ''Movement and scale'' in ''Apparaturen bewegter Bilder'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that such devices as the zoetrope were not replaced by cinema: they were still used after the breakthrough of film.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=tagwDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;ots=8Z8s4vfIcv&amp;dq=zoetrope%20strips%20buy%20-stephenherbert.co%20-pinterest&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many early media examples are also part of a tradition that not only shaped cinema, but also [[home video]], [[video games]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[virtual reality]] and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Gunning ''Introduction'' in Laurent Mannoni's ''The Great Art of Light and Shadow'' (p. XX) (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The study of early media devices is also part of a wider and less [[teleology|teleological]] approach called [[media archaeology]].

Many of the precursors of film are also referred to as "philosophical toys", or "[[optical toys]]".

==Shadow play==
[[File:OFB-Qianlongsatz03-Krieger.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Shadow play]] figures, circa 1780.]]
{{Main|Shadowgraphy (performing art)}}
{{Main|Shadow play}}

The earliest projection of images was most likely done in primitive [[shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]] dating back to prehistory. It evolved into more refined forms of [[shadow play|shadow puppetry]], mostly with flat jointed cut-out figures which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen. The shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. [[Plato]] seemed to hint at shadow puppetry in his ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]'' (circa 380 BCE) but no other signs of shadow play in ancient Greece are known and Plato's idea was clearly a hypothetical allegory. Shadow puppetry was possibly developed in India around 200 BCE, but also has a long history in Indonesia (records relating to [[Wayang]] since 840 CE), Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, China (records since around 1000 CE) and Nepal. It later spread to the [[Ottoman empire]] and seems not to have reached Europe before the 17th century. It became very popular in France at the end of the 18th century. Around the time cinema was developed several theaters in Montmartre showed elaborate "Ombres Chinoises" shows that were very successful. The famous [[Le Chat noir]] produced 45 different shows between 1885 and 1896.

==Camera obscura==
{{Main|Camera obscura}}
Projection of images can occur naturally when rays of light pass through a small hole and produce an inverted image on a surface in a dark area behind the hole. This phenomenon is known as [[camera obscura]] or pinhole image. Its oldest known recorded description is found in Chinese [[Mohism|Mohist]] writings dated to circa 400 BCE.&lt;ref name=needham4&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol. IV, part 1: Physics and Physical Technology|url=https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people have probably witnessed and made use of occurrences of the phenomenon since prehistoric times. It has been suggested that distortions in the shapes of animals in many [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s were possibly based on distortions seen in pinhole images formed through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide.&lt;ref&gt;http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura or proto [[magic lantern]] projections.&lt;ref&gt;http://paleo-camera.com/ancient-greece/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 2004 |url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife |last= Ruffles |first=Tom |pages= 15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt; 
In Arab and European science the camera obscura was used in darkened rooms since circa 1000 CE to study light and especially sun eclipses.

Very occasionally the camera obscura was thought of as an instrument for live projections of performances to entertain an audience inside a darkened room. Purportedly [[Arnaldus de Villa Nova]] did so at the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Paul T.|title=The History of the Discovery of Cinematography|url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/900.htm |accessdate=2014-01-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231080921/http://www.precinemahistory.net/900.htm |archivedate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Roger|title=A Look Into Camera Obscuras|url=http://www.camera-obscura.org.uk/Camera_Obscura/Timeline.html|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1589 [[Giambattista della Porta]] imagined how the camera obscura could be used to project hunting scenes, battles, games or anything desired. Real or artificial forests, rivers, mountains as well as animals could be used for scenes on an outside stage and projected into a dark room with spectators.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|last=Larsen|first=Kenneth|title=Sonnet 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project clearer images has been dated back to 1550.&lt;ref name=Ilardi&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;ots=0nY6rITCY6&amp;dq=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1572, the oldest known suggestion for the camera to become mobile was described as a lightweight wooden hut to be carried around on two wooden poles.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye of the Beholder|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|year=2015|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EQJ-BAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT110&amp;ots=fqygKmz1u-&amp;dq=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PT110#v=onepage&amp;q=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; More practical solutions followed in the 17th century in the shape of tents and eventually as portable wooden boxes with a viewing pane and a mirror to get an upright image. The camera obscura became increasingly popular as a drawing and painting aid for artists.

==Magic lantern and other image projectors==
{{Main|projector}}
{{Main|Magic lantern}}

The "trotting horse lamp" [走馬燈] has been known in China since before 1000 CE. It is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern and appear to chase each other. Some versions showed more motion with the heads, feet or hands of figures connected with fine iron wire to an extra inner layer and triggered by a transversely connected iron wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Js_lBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=RtAiKy6JSA&amp;dq=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology, Volume 3|author=Yongxiang Lu|pages=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamp would typically show images of horses and horse-riders.

Several scholars and inventors, like [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]] (circa 1420), [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (circa 1515) and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] (1608) possibly had early image projectors before the invention of the [[Magic lantern|Magic Lantern]]. [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s 1645 first edition of ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his forerunner to the magic lantern: the "Steganographic Mirror". This was a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hUvNnJteew4C&amp;pg=RA1-PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|page=912|year=1645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kircher also suggested projecting live flies and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror.&lt;ref name=Gorman2007&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely distributed and may have offered some inspiration for [[Christiaan Huygens]]' invention of the magic lantern in 1659.

Moving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention; Christiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches for slides show a skeleton taking his skull off his neck and placing it back. Techniques to add motion to the painted glass slides were described since circa 1700. These usually involved parts (for instance limbs) painted on one or more extra pieces of glass moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture.&lt;ref name=Rossell2005&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/341263/The_Magic_Lantern_and_Moving_Images_before_1800|first=Deac|last=Rossell|title=The Magic Lantern and Moving Images before 1800|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1770 [[Edmé-Gilles Guyot]] detailed how to project a magic lantern image on smoke to create a transparent, shimmering image of a hovering ghost. This technique was used in the [[phantasmagoria]] shows that became very popular in several parts of Europe between 1790 and the 1830s. Other techniques were developed to produce convincing ghost experiences. The lantern was handheld to move the projection across the screen (which was usually an almost invisible transparent screen behind which the lanternist operated hidden in the dark). A ghost could seem to approach the audience or grow larger by moving the lantern towards the screen, sometimes with the lantern on a trolley on rails, just like a [[tracking shot]] in films. Multiple lanterns not only could make ghosts move independently, but were also occasionally used for [[superimposition]] in the composition of complicated scenes. By experimenting with superimposition [[dissolving views]] were invented and became a separate popular magic lantern show, especially in England in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name=Heard2006&gt;Heard, Mervyn. ''PHANTASMAGORIA: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''. The Projection Box, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolving views typically showed a landscape changing from a winter version to a spring or summer variation by slowly diminishing the light from one version while introducing the aligned projection of the other slide. Another use of dissolving views, projected with a triple lantern, showed a sleeping figure while images of dreams were superimposed above its head and dissolved from one scene to another.&lt;ref name=luikerdissolve&gt;{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/dissolving_uk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the use of a [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] in film.

Between the 1840s and 1870s several abstract magic lantern effects were developed. This included the chromatrope which projected dazzling colorful geometrical patterns by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=N0cxAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=polytechnic%20chromatrope&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=chromatrope&amp;f=false|title=The Athenæum|date=1845-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally small jointed shadow puppets had been used in phantasmagoria shows.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; Magic lantern slides with jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels were also produced commercially and patented in 1891. A popular version of these "Fantoccini slides" had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Named after the Italian word for animated puppets, like marionettes or [[Jumping jack (toy)|jumping jacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/fantoccini1_uk.htm|title=Luikerwaal - Fantoccini Slides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animation==
{{Main|History of Animation}}
Several possible examples of very early sequential images can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, on a 5,200-year old pottery bowl found in Iran and in an [[Egypt]]ian [[mural]] approximately 4000 years old, found in the tomb of [[Khnumhotep]] at the [[Beni Hassan]] cemetery. However, it is very unlikely that these could be viewed in motion.

The theory of [[Thaumatrope]] induction was presented by [[Peter Mark Roget]] in 1824 in his paper ''Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures''. This explained the concept called '[[persistence of vision]]'. Two years later, the first of many gadgets to create the illusion of movement was marketed by [[John Ayrton Paris]]. The card, called the ''Thaumatrope'', gave an optical illusion when spun. [[Michael Faraday]] also began to experiment with visual illusions at this time, creating a revolving wheel.

[[File:August Fuhrmann-Kaiserpanorama 1880.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Kaiserpanorama, 1880, provided a group stereoscope card viewing experience]]
Moving images were produced on revolving drums and disks in the 1830s with independent invention by [[Simon von Stampfer]] (Stroboscope) in Austria, [[Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau|Joseph Plateau]] (Phenakistoscope) in Belgium and [[William Horner]] ([[zoetrope]]) in Britain. The [[Zoetrope]], a.k.a., the ''Daedalum'' was a revolving cylinder which gave the illusion of motion to the pictures inside. [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] developed an early animation device in 1877, which he called the [[Praxinoscope]].

Other mechanisms followed: in 1832 [[Joseph Plateau]] created the Anorthoscope and [[Phenakistiscope]]; in 1833 [[Simon Stampler]] developed the [[Stroboscope]]; in 1853, [[Franz von Uchatius]] invented the [[Kinetoscope]] which projected moving drawings;

==Other developments==
Preceding cinema by thousands of years, [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[dances]] already included elements like [[Script (recorded media)|scripts]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[lighting]], [[costumes]], [[Filmmaking|production]], [[Film director|direction]], [[actors]], [[audiences]], [[storyboards]], and [[film score]]s. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism applied, such as [[mise en scene]]. However, [[moving images]] and sound were not [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] intended for [[Instant replay|replay]]ing as in film.  

Puppetry, another ancient art form, shares elements with [[animation]] and [[claymation]].

In 1740 and 1748, [[David Hume]] published ''[[Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', arguing for the associations and causes of ideas with visual images, forerunners to the language of film.

==Modern era==

[[Optics]] developed during the [[scientific revolution]] with a theory of [[lens (optics)|lenses]]. [[Photographic film]] was created in the 19th century. [[Phonographic]] recording of sound was invented in the 19th century.

In 1861 [[Samuel Goodale]] patented a hand-turned [[stereoscope]] device which rapidly moves stereo images past a viewer;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayinsci.com/Events/Patent/Stereoscope31310.htm todayinsci.com] Goodale patent docs&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year [[Coleman Sellers II]] built the [[Kinematoscope]] - a series of [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic pictures]] on glass plates, linked together in a chain, and mounted in a box. The simple and convenient [[flip book]] was patented in 1868 and has endured as a commercial product.

The crucial invention of [[celluloid]] was made in 1855 by [[Alexander Parkes]], a substance he initially called [[Parkesine]]. This was marketed from 1869 by [[John Wesley Hyatt|John and Isaiah Hyatt]].

==First motion-pictures==
[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|200px|left|A gif animation of an 1870s chronophotograph sequence by [[Eadweard Muybridge]]]]
The first real sequence photographed in real-time, rather than consisting of a series of posed photographs, was created in the US in 1878 by British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Under the sponsorship of [[Leland Stanford]], he photographed a horse named [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Sallie Gardner]] in rapid motion by using a series of separate still cameras. The experiment took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in [[Palo Alto, California]], with the press present, and was meant to determine whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at the same time. The cameras were arranged in a line parallel to the edge of the track and spaced 27 inches apart. Each camera shutter was triggered by a thread as the horse passed and each exposure was made in only one thousandth of a second.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clegg|first=Brian|title=The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muybridge would publish many cards, plates and books of his chronopotograph sequences. He also had an artist paint sequences onto a glass disc that could be used to project the images onto a screen with a device he called a [[zoopraxiscope]], which can be regarded as one of the first [[movie projector]]s. His innovative process was an intermediate stage toward motion pictures and cinematography.

[[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invented a chronophotographic gun in 1882, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames on the same picture. He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animals and human locomotion. An early projector, along similar lines to Muybridge's zoopraxiscope, was built by [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in 1887. His [[Electrotachyscope]] used 24 images on a rotating glass disk.&lt;ref&gt;''Faszination der Bewegung: Ottomar Anschütz zwischen Photographie und Kino'' p. 185, Deac Rossell. {{ISBN|3-87877-774-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 his invention projected moving images&lt;ref&gt;''Industry, liberty, and a vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's kinesigraph'', Stephen Herbert, p. 13, {{ISBN|0-9523941-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin.

As a result of the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and Étienne-Jules Marey, researchers in the late 19th century began to realize that motion picture capture and display was a distinct practical possibility.

[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|thumb|right|The first motion-picture was ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', shot in 1888.]] 
The [[France|Frenchman]] [[Louis Le Prince]] began work on such a project in the 1880s, while working in [[Leeds]], [[England]]. Le Prince had been inspired by Muybridge's pioneering experiments, and he patented his first invention, a 16 lens camera, in 1887.&lt;ref name="Naughton"&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/LE_PRINCE_BIO.html Adventures in CyberSound: Le Prince, Louis Aimé Augustin], Dr Russell Naughton (using source: Michael Harvey, NMPFT Pioneers of Early Cinema: 1. Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince)&lt;/ref&gt; The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it wasn't a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint and thus the [[Movie projector|projected]] image jumped about.

By May 1887,&lt;ref name="Naughton"/&gt; after much trial and error, Le Prince was finally able to develop and patent the first single lens camera in 1888, leading to the birth of the modern motion-picture film over the next decade. Le Prince shot the first sequences of moving film in the world, what would become known as ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', shot on October 14, 1888 in [[Roundhay]], [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7rNu06-I6IsC|title=On the Origin of Spin: (Or how Hollywood, the Ad Men and the World Wide Web became the Fifth Estate and created our images of power)|author=Brendan Bruce|year=2013|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

{{Performing arts}}
'''Puppetry''' is a form of [[theatre]] or performance that involves the manipulation of [[puppet]]s – [[inanimate]] objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a [[puppeteer]]. Such a performance is also known as a {{nowrap|'''puppet play'''}}. The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in [[storytelling]].

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are [[finger puppet]]s, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and [[sock puppet]]s, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth". A [[hand puppet]] is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around ([[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. [[Marionette]]s are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as [[sacred]] objects in [[rituals]], as symbolic [[Effigy|effigies]] in celebrations such as [[carnival]]s, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in [[transformative arts]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History'', John Bell, Detroit Institute of Art, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dugan, E.A., ''Emotions in Motion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There is evidence that they were used in [[Egypt]] as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and [[ivory]] have also been found in Egyptian tombs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Hieroglyphs]] also describe "walking statues" being used in ancient [[Egypt]]ian religious dramas.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry was practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, David, ''Puppetry'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and [[masks]]) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and [[mask|masked performance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Asia ===

====East, Southeast and South Asia====
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese "commander-in-chief" marionette character]]
There is slight evidence for puppetry in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14/&gt; The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Tamil literature]] from the [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam Era]], and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including [[edicts of Ashoka|Ashokan edicts]], describe puppets.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14-15&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Works like the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and the ''[[Kamasutra]]'' elaborate on puppetry in some detail.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-15-16&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese ''[[Wayang]]'' theater was influenced by [[India]]n traditions.&lt;ref name=Bell-puppet-46&gt;Bell, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in [[Sanskrit]] plays was known as "Sutradhara",  "the holder of strings".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; ''Wayang'' is a strong tradition of puppetry native of [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]] &amp; [[Bali]]. In [[Java]], [[Wayang Kulit Indonesia|wayang kulit]], an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is [[Wayang golek]].

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in "pi-yung xi", the "theatre of the lantern shadows", or, as it is more commonly known today, [[Shadow theatre|Chinese shadow theatre]]. By the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In [[Taiwan]], [[budaixi]] puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, [[somersault]]s in the air.

[[Japan]] has many forms of puppetry, including the [[bunraku]]. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.

[[Image:Rajasthani-puppeteer.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer from [[Rajasthan]] (India)]]
In [[Korea]], the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King.&lt;ref name="sangsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/768|author=Sang-su, Choe|title=A Study of the Korean Puppet Play|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean, the word for puppet is "Kkoktugakshi".&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt; "Gagsi" means a "bride" or a "young woman", which was the most common form the dolls took. A [[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkoktugakshi puppet play]] has eight scenes.&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt;

[[Thailand]] has [[Hun Krabok]], a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.

[[Vietnam]] developed the art form of [[water puppetry]], that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.

====India====
{{Main|Puppetry in India}}
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' there are references to puppets. The [[Rajasthani Puppet]] from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, [[Ramdas Padhye]], subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.php|title=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT)|website=ccrtindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;String puppets
[[File:Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha) at Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune.JPG|thumb|Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha)]]
India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed.  The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

;Shadow puppets
[[File:Tholpava koothu shadow puppet back stage (1).jpg|thumb|Tholpavakoothu (Kerala)]]
India has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. [[Tholpavakoothu]] (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of [[shadow puppetry]] that is unique to [[Kerala]], [[India]].  The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.

;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. 
;Glove puppets
Glove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the ''dholak''with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.

====Afghanistan====
[[Afghanistan]] has produced a form of puppetry known as [[buz-baz]].  During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a [[markhor]] while playing a [[dambura]].

===West Asia===
[[Image:Karagoez davulcu.jpg|110px|thumb|right|Karagoz, Turkish shadow puppetry]]
Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. [[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in [[Istanbul]] where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Mutlu, Hayali Mustafa, ''Tradition Folk The Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'', a [[metaphor]] translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadow of fancy", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, "the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also..."special effects" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Feeney, John, ''Saudi Aramco World'' (article), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular .&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Willem, ''The History of Theater in Iran'', {{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khane''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets.&lt;ref&gt;Mehr News Agency, [http://www.mehrnews.com www.mehrnews.com], 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran Daily'' [http://www.iran-daily.com www.iran-daily.com], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th/4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from [[ancient Greece]], historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, John, ''Practical Puppetry'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;

In ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]] clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alcamo-Pupi-bjs2007-01.jpg|Sicilian Puppet Theatre|thumb|right]]

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance
Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]] refer to them.&lt;ref name="Binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church used marionettes to perform [[morality plays]].&lt;ref name="Binyon"/&gt; It is believed that the word '''[[marionette]]''' originates from the little figures of the [[Virgin Mary]], hence the word "marionette" or "Mary doll.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Mabel &amp; Les, ''Marionettes: A Hobby for Everyone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more [[ribald]] and [[slapstick]]. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called [[Commedia dell'arte]]. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Suib, Leonard Broadman, Muriel, ''Marionettes Onstage!'', p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called "[[Opera dei pupi]]", or "Opera of the puppets". The "Opera dei pupi" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the [[troubadour|Provençal troubadour tradition]], in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] circles, as a celebration of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Signorelli, Collezione Maria,  [http://www.collezionemariasignorelli.it/inglese_01_inizio.htm www.collezionemariasignorelli.it].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the marionettes of [[Pietro Radillo]] became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====France====
[[Guignol]] is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". [[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Guignol de Lyon]]

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====
[[File:Burattini ca 1770.jpg|British Puppet theatre (Punch and Judy style), c. 1770|thumb|right]]
The traditional British ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The character of "Punch" derives from the character [[Pulcinella]], which was Anglicized to ''Punchinello''. He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]], figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally "Joan", but later became "Judy". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar ''Punch and Judy'' puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable [[:wikt:booth|booth]]. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. One of Shaw's last plays, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

From 1957-1969, [[Gerry Anderson]] produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with [[Roberta Leigh]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ending with ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Many of these series (the most famous of which was ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'') employed a technique called [[Supermarionation]], which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with ''[[Terrahawks]]'' and the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot]] ''[[Space Precinct#Pilot|Space Police]]'' in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the [[Little Angel Theatre]] in [[Islington]], London, [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] in London, [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]], the [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]], [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, [[Biggar, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. [[Don Austen]], a British puppeteer, worked with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and [[Green Ginger]], which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political [[satire]] in the British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including ''[[War Horse (play)|Warhorse]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]] and ''[[Madama Butterfly|Madam Butterfly]]'' at the [[English National Opera]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is ''Jan Klaassen'' (and Judy is ''Katrijn''); in Denmark ''Mester Jackel''; in Russia ''Petrushka''; and in Romania ''Vasilache''. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mullholland, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called [[Kasperle]] of Kaspar while Judy is called [[Grete]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, [[Count Franz Pocci]] founded the [[Münchner Marionettentheater|Munich Marionette Theatre]]. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. [[Albrecht Roser]] has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in [[Stuttgart]]. His characters ''Clown Gustaf'' and ''Grandmother'' are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppets'' by David Currell, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grandmother'', while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In [[Lindau]], [[Lindauer Marionettenoper|the Lindau Marionette Opera]] was founded in 2000 by [[Bernard Leismueller]] and [[Ralf Hechelmann]]. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

In Augsburg, the historic [[Augsburger Puppenkiste|Augsburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1943 by [[Walter Oehmichen]]. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, [[Klaus Marschall]] and [[Juergen Marschall]].

Much earlier in nearby [[Salzburg]], Austria, the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]] and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of [[Gretl Aicher]]. It performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

====Czech Republic====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in [[Prague]], and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="dubska"&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, Jan Novak, Nina Malikova and Marie Zdenkova, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer,&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt;

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, [[Josef Skupa]] created his most famous puppet characters: comical father [[Spejbl]] and his rascal son [[Hurvínek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. An important puppet organisation is the [[National Marionette Theatre]] in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky ("Cakes and Puppets"), founded by [[Marek Bečka]].&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Jiří Trnka]] was an acknowledged leader in this area.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Puppets in Prague, www.puppetsinprague.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]], but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The [[Teotihuacan]] culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also used ceremonial puppets.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied [[Hernando Cortez]] on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals,  working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the [[United States]]. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with [[Howdy Doody]] of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. [[Bil Baird]] worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, [[Cora Eisenberg]] had their own marionette theatre in New York. [[Ventriloquist]], [[Edgar Bergen]] also made a major contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Funni, Arthur, ''The Radio Years of Bergen and McCarthy'' (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Peter Schumann's [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, [[Jim Henson]] was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. Initially, through the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and later in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. [[Wayland Flowers]] also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, [[Madame]].

[[Sid and Marty Krofft]] are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely [[HR Puffinstuff]] and [[Lidsville]]

Puppets also have been used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, notably with the character of [[Yoda]]. His voice and manipulation was provided by [[Frank Oz]].

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, [[Peter Scriven]] founded the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]] and had beautiful marionette productions such as [[The Tintookies]], [[Little Fella Bindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=163386&amp;search=sad&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s= 98/25/2 Marionette puppet, 'Tintookies Little Fella Bindi', Aboriginal figure, papier mache / wood / cotton / felt / feathers / metal, designed by Colin Garland for the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1958-1977 - Powerhouse Museum Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Explorers]] and [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by [[Barbara Turnbull]] and her husband [[Bill Turnbull (puppeteer)]] toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the [[Queensland Arts Council]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]], [[Brisbane]]. [[David Poulton]] toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'Stutter leads to lifetime with puppets', Sunshine Coast Daily, 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hamilton (puppeteer)|David Hamilton]], one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster [[Jamie Dunn]] was famous for his Muppet-style character, [[Agro (puppet)]] who featured on several [[Seven Network]] television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the [[United States]] by puppeteers from the [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson Company]], [[Brett Hansen]] and his [[Brisbane]] based [[Larrikin Puppets]] company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. [[Cabaret Puppet Theatre]], based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cabaret Puppet Theatre www.cabaretpuppettheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne [[Handspan Theatre]] 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

[[File:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|[[Snuff Puppets]] Skullies from Scarey|thumb|right]]
A post-graduate course existed at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer [[Norman Hetherington]] was famous for his marionette, [[Mr. Squiggle]] who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from "squiggles" sent in by children from around the country. [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of [[UNIMA Australia]], former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

[[Rod Hull]] also made a contribution with his puppet [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. [[Snuff Puppets]] is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in [[Melbourne]], their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

==Contemporary era==

From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the "lack of self-consciousness" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History''/John Bell/Chapter 6/Detroit Institute of Art/2000 {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets.png|thumb|Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets]]

[[Sergei Obraztsov]] explored the concept of ''kukolnost'' ('puppetness'), despite [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence on realism.
Other pioneers, including [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Erwin Piscator]] were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. [[Maeterlinck]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as [[Picasso]], [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] began to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Craig's concept of the "übermarionette"&amp;mdash;in which the director treats the actors like objects&amp;mdash;has been highly influential on contemporary "object theatre" and "[[physical theatre]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Tadeusz Kantor]] frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms "putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as [[Tony Sarg]], Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, [[Bil Baird]], Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, [[Peter Schumann]], [[Dattatreya Aralikatte]], [[Jim Henson]], [[Dadi Pudumjee]], and [[Julie Taymor]] have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], Bob Frith of [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and Sandy Speiler of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Theatre, from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook''/James Roose-Evans, 1970 Studio Vista {{ISBN|0-415-00963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jim Henson Foundation]], founded by puppeteer and [[Muppet]] creator [[Jim Henson]], is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Henson Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hensonfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in [[Boise, Idaho]] continue the [[avant garde]] [[satire|satirical]] tradition for [[millennial]]s.&lt;ref name="Early 21st-century puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/horrific-puppet-affair-finds-humor-in-the-space-between-halloween-and-christmas/Content?oid=8219881 |title=Horrific Puppet Affair Finds Humor in the Space Between Halloween and Christmas  |last=Berry |first=Harrison |date=2017-12-12 |website=Boise Weekly |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennial Avant Garde Puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseartsandhistory.org/blog/2017/12/20/creators-makers-and-doers-homegrown-theatre/ |title=Puppetry, Pantomime, &amp; Projections: HomeGrown Theatre's Shortcut to Spectacle |last=Burton |first=Brooke |date=2017-12-20 |website=Boise City Department of Arts &amp; History |access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salus-Grady libel law''', also known as the '''Pennsylvania anti-cartoon law''', was enacted by the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] in 1903 to discourage political criticism from the [[news media|press]]. Governor [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]] championed the controversial law in response to an ongoing set of cartoons that mocked his successful 1902 gubernatorial campaign and his tenure as governor. Upset by being caricatured as a parrot, Pennypacker denounced what he deemed "the sensational devices and the disregard of truth" employed by the press.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb| first = Chris| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Drawn to Extremes: The Use and Abuse of Editorial Cartoons| publisher = Columbia University Press| series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2004| location = New York| pages = 73–77| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LxCtgSAuXM0C&amp;pg=PA246| doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dorman| first = Dana| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = When Cartoonists Were Criminals| work = | publisher = Historical Society of Pennsylvania| date = 3 September 2014| url = http://hsp.org/blogs/fondly-pennsylvania/when-cartoonists-were-criminals| format = | doi = | accessdate = 16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;{{cite act |title= To authorize civil actions for the recovery of damages arising from newspaper publications negligently made... |number= 265|language= |date= 12 May 1903|article= |url= https://archive.org/details/368423-pennsylvanias-1903-anti-cartoon-law|accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law broadened the circumstances under which a newspaper could be sued for [[libel]], and made editors liable in their personal capacity to such lawsuits. Rather than having the [[chilling effect]] Pennypacker desired, the law backfired spectacularly. [[Charles Nelan]] and other artists drew cartoons more contemptuous than the previous ones, and nationally circulating newspapers  joined the Pennsylvanian newspapers in protesting against the law.&lt;ref name="Piott"&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Right of the Cartoonist: Samuel Pennypacker and Freedom of the Press| journal = Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies| volume = 55| issue = 2| pages = 78–91| publisher = Science Press| location = Ephrata| date = April 1988| language = | url = https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/view/24685/24454| jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = 16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law languished along with Pennypacker when he stepped down from office in 1907, as his successor quickly repealed the controversial measure.&lt;ref name="Dorman"/&gt;
 
==Background==
The start of the 20th century coincided with an increasingly vocal press and journalists who targeted their subjects with editorial cartoons and investigative reports.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;{{rp|72}} Feeling threatened, politicians in several states proposed laws that would place restrictions upon these unflattering images.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dewey| first = Donald| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Art of Ill Will: The Story of American Political Cartoons| publisher = New York University Press| series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2007| location = New York| pages = 37| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vNI9046BaRAC&amp;pg=PA37| doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between journalist and political figure would come to a head in Pennsylvania when the Republican Party nominated Samuel W. Pennypacker, then a sitting judge in Philadelphia, for the office of governor. Pennypacker's short temper and arrogance made him an easy target. Although he was perceived as an honest judge, Pennypacker refused to acknowledge the corruption present in Pennsylvania's political environment, declaring that the government had "no ills that are worthy of mention." Pennypacker strongly defended the [[party boss]], [[Matthew S. Quay]], and attributed his nomination not to Quay's behind-the-scenes maneuvering, but to the strength of his own record as a judge. He saw his own nomination as an unprecedented achievement of honest politics.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;
[[File:Polly Got a Cracker - Nelan 1903.jpg|thumb|"Polly Got a Cracker" (May 16, 1903): Nelan depicts Pennypacker as a parrot, startled by an exploding firecracker of "public opinion."]]
[[Charles Nelan]], a cartoonist working for the anti-Quay ''[[North American]]'' newspaper out of Philadelphia, capitalized on the candidate's remarks by drawing him as a conceited parrot. Referencing the parrot's propensity for [[talking bird|mimicry]], the caricatured bird repeated the words of party elders: metaphorically, Nelan accused Pennypacker of being a rubber stamp for the desires of Quay and his cronies. Later cartoons similarly implied that the judge was tainted by his association with Quay, but Pennypacker won the governor's race anyway.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorman"/&gt; Despite his victory, Pennypacker harbored ill will against the cartoonists, with his inaugural address criticizing "sensational journals" as a "terror to the household, a detriment to the public service, and an impediment to the courts of justice."&lt;ref name="philly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20160131_A_Pennsylvania_battle_waged_in_ink.html#5DVhkqcmwaISFWVA.99|title=A Pennsylvania battle waged in ink|work=philly-archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salus-Grady libel law was preceded by an unsuccessful bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Frederick Taylor Pusey| work = | publisher = Historical Society of Pennsylvania| date = | url = http://digitalhistory.hsp.org/hint/politics-graphic-detail/person/frederick-taylor-pusey| format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by [[Frederick Taylor Pusey]] to ban "any cartoon or caricature or picture portraying, describing or representing any person, either by distortion, innuendo or otherwise, in the form or likeness of beast, bird, fish, insect, or other unhuman animal, thereby tending to expose such person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule." But the legislators did not count on the ingenuity of the cartoonists who immediately began ridiculing Governor Pennypacker and other officials with caricatures in the guise of vegetables and inanimate objects. Politicians were depicted as turnips, trees, chestnut burrs, squash, beer steins, and other non-animal forms. Philadelphia's ''North American'' newspaper proposed a new coat of arms for Pennsylvania featuring an impaled cartoonist's head, a gag and muzzle, a dwarf on a stool, a pussy cat, and a jackass in knee-high boots.&lt;ref name="philly.com"/&gt; State representative [[Samuel W. Salus]] and state senator [[John C. Grady]] took a different approach, proposing that newspaper editors be made liable in their personal capacity to libel lawsuits, and their bill was passed.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt; The law was never enforced, and Pennypacker was hounded for his entire term as governor by critical cartoons.  After his predecessor's term was finished, the new administration of Governor [[Edwin Sydney Stuart]] swiftly rescinded the law.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

'''''Sasuke''''' (サスケ; stylized in Japan as '''''SASUKE''''') is a Japanese [[sports entertainment]] [[television special]] in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage [[obstacle course]]. An edited version, named '''''Ninja Warrior''''', is screened in at least 18 other countries.

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Development==
Recorded on location at [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|Midoriyama]] studio in [[Yokohama]], it airs on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] between [[Japanese television drama]] seasons. The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each three-hour special (with the exception of ''Sasuke'' 24 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 35 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, except in 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|筋肉番付|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html "Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS renamed the show once again '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition.

Applicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.

In its 35 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:秋山和彦|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,&lt;ref&gt;"Yuuji Urushihara does it again" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).

===Popularity===
The popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.

''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Gary. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-12-07-ninja07_ST_N.htm "Americans latch onto G4's intense 'Ninja Warrior'"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. December 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.

Other international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), Germany ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) . An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.

==Competitors==
The show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Sasuke All-Stars===
The Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The six consisted of:
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=秋山和彦}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory. He has not been able to repeat his success, being hindered by an eye condition known as degenerative [[retinitis]] that has been affecting him for years. Overall, he has competed 20 times and has been officially retired since ''Sasuke'' 28 in 2012. An offer was made for Akiyama to return for the 30th anniversary tournament in 2014, but he declined and has remained retired since.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

†&amp;nbsp;– Nagano touched the top of the Shin-Cliffhanger after swinging from the second to the third ledge. He disqualified himself, admitting his error and bowing out after he reached the next platform.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Nagano was allowed a second attempt at the First Stage due to a malfunction of the Slider Jump.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Toshihiro Takeda|ja|3=竹田敏浩}}''', a [[firefighter]]. Known for reaching the Third Stage more than anyone else. He can usually be seen wearing his trademark orange firefighter pants and dark blue shirt, though he changed his trademark clothes since ''Sasuke'' 30 after he quit his firefighter job. However, he is the only All-Star that hasn't made it to the Final Stage yet. Overall, he has competed 26 times and continues to compete to this day. The only times he didn't appear were in ''Sasuke'' 26 and ''Sasuke'' 27, thus avoiding any risk affecting his new job as a Helicopter Rescue Jumper.

He has competed the least of the All-Stars: only 12 times due to chronic back and neck pains that have continued to plague him for years. Despite having only competed once since ''Sasuke'' 21, he is not officially retired and has not ruled out the possibility of returning should his health permit it, although this is unlikely.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Katsumi Yamada|ja|3=山田勝己}}''', a steel worker known as "Mr. ''Sasuke''" or "Mr. ''Ninja Warrior''". He was once thought to be the one most likely to complete the entire course by the tournament's producers, but has not passed the First Stage in thirteen years, since tournament 12. He has "retired" from ''Sasuke'' on three separate occasions following the 12th, 24th and 28th tournaments, but returned each time nonetheless. He was given the nickname "Mr. ''Sasuke''" because he was once thought to be the most likely competitor to clear all four stages, but hasn't passed the First Stage since ''Sasuke'' 12. Overall, he has competed 27 times, second only to Yamamoto Shingo, but has been barred from competing since ''Sasuke'' 30 in 2014.

===Sasuke New Stars (Shin Sedai)===
The Sasuke New Stars (in contrast to the All stars) are new younger competitors who have made a name for themselves on the recent editions of the course. "Shin Sedai" or New Stars became famous since ''Sasuke'' 17, after Shunsuke Nagasaki made it to the Final Stage.  There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shunsuke Nagasaki|ja|3=長崎峻侑}}''', a trampolinist. He is considered one of the most promising of recent competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This skilled trampolinist, who is called "Prince of the Trampoline", has won several medals in the Trampoline World Cups and Doha Asian Games. He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the "Shin Sedai" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. As of 2018, Nagasaki has completed the First Stage eleven times (five consecutively), the Second Stage seven times (four consecutively), and the Third Stage once.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Yuuji Urushihara|ja|3=漆原裕治}}''', a [[shoe]] salesman, an Unlimited Cliffer member No. 3.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} He spent upwards of five years trying to qualify through the ''Sasuke'' Trials. Finally, he qualified for ''Sasuke'' 21, and in the next tournament became the first competitor to reach Shin-''Sasuke''{{'s}} Final Stage. He got his Final Stage attempt in ''Sasuke'' 22, but he failed it close to the button. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he became the third person to achieve Kanzenseiha, and in ''Sasuke'' 27, he went on to become the only person to achieve it twice. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 29, he failed the Backstream. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he timed out on the Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he took more time to clear the Tackle and timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In SASUKE 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hitoshi Kanno|ja|3=菅野仁志}}''', a janitorial worker/jewelry designer. He has been considered one of the most serious contenders to kanzenseiha. In ''Sasuke'' 23, when Nagano Makoto joined him in the Final Stage, it was heard that Kanno was the leader of the Shin Sedai. After that in ''Sasuke'' 24, Kanno timed out on the First Stage, then in ''Sasuke'' 25 he failed the Balance Tank on the Second Stage. Then in ''Sasuke'' 26 he failed the Rolling Escargot on the First Stage, and in ''Sasuke'' 27 he withdrew before the Salmon Ladder on the Second Stage. Then he reached the Third Stage in ''Sasuke'' 28, 29, 30, and 31, failing the Crazy Cliffhanger the first three times, but clearing it on his fourth attempt. He failed on the next obstacle, Vertical Limit Kai. He timed out at the top of the Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 32, after dislocating his shoulder. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill; he jumped from the bottom of Rolling Hill too high but he couldn't save himself from his fall. He did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 34. He came back for SASUKE 35. He started strong, and even made the transition on the Dragon Glider, but the bar became crooked while dismounting, causing him to only get one foot on the platform and tap the water.

Then he failed the Slider Jump in ''Sasuke'' 22. He cleared the First Stage for the first time in ''Sasuke'' 24, but he failed the Unstable Bridge. He failed the First Stage back to back in ''Sasuke'' 25 and ''Sasuke'' 27. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he cleared the Third Stage and made it to the Final Stage. However, he was slow on the Spider Climb and timed out at the Tsuna Nobori about 8&amp;nbsp;m from the buzzer. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he failed to repeat his performance from the previous tournament, when he failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kawaguchi once again made it to the Third Stage, however he failed at the Flying Bar when he ran the obstacle in bad weather. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed the Double Pendulum in the First Stage, when he jumped too soon for the sandbag and his hand didn't get to grab onto it to it high enough, and he fell into the water. He showed his revenge for last season in ''Sasuke'' 34; he made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and cleared the first transition, but he failed to make the transition into the moving ledge. He made it to the Third Stage once again, this time Kawaguchi carry out revenge on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, but his run came to an end after an unclean transition to the second ledge on the Vertical Limit in ''Sasuke'' 35.

*'''Yusuke Suzuki''', a PE teacher in a junior high school in Kanagawa. He competed five times. He competed since ''Sasuke'' 16 but his run was all cut. After a seven-year hiatus, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Spin Bridge and the second wall of the Ni Ren Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 30. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was completely cut. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 32 wearing number 66, and completed the First Stage for the first time with just 2.12 seconds remaining. He then went on to clear the Second Stage, becoming one of eight to do so, with 9.59 seconds remaining. However, his first attempt on the Third Stage was a struggle. On the first transition of the Drum Hopper he slipped and nearly fell, and only just managed to reposition himself, while the other transitions showed signs of unease. His strength was sapped for the next obstacle, the Flying Bar, where he failed the first transition after the bar did not reach the second set of rungs. In his fluff piece for ''Sasuke'' 32, it was falsely stated that he had failed the First Stage four times, when in fact he had competed for the first time in four tournaments beforehand. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested but he failed the Double Pendulum. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he failed the Sidewinder Kai. He was unable to repeat his performance from the previous tournament as he had a surprising fall on the Fish Bone in ''Sasuke'' 35.

===Athletes===
World-class athletes, including Olympians, have attempted ''Sasuke'':

====Japanese athletes====

Several Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage Rolling Escargot.

After the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.

====American athletes====
Various American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&amp;nbsp;– in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.

[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.

[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.

Levi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.

Levi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.

Levi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.

He has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Drew Drechsel|ja|3=ドリュー・ドレッシェル}}''', an American gym trainer known as "Real Life Ninja". He also participated in ''American Ninja Challenge'' and then became an ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' stalwart once NBC and G4/Esquire created an entire American-based ''Sasuke'' competition. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 (reaching the Third Stage), after he won the ''Sasuke'' Asean Open Cup 2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (where he achieved a gold medal in overall stages) and ''ANW'' Season 7 and 8 (where he is to compete in the Vegas Finals) in the space of a calendar year. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 31 and failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. He made his fourth appearance in ''Sasuke'' 32; he is the first person ever to beat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and the third American to clear the Japanese Cliffhanger, after Travis Allen Schroeder in ''Sasuke'' 4 and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8, but he failed the next obstacle Vertical Limit Kai. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he failed the second trial on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, due to timing problems on the moving ledge. He fell at the same place just like the last tournament in ''Sasuke'' 34. He managed to clear the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, the second time he cleared it. Unfortunately, he failed on the first ledge of the Vertical Limit, he managed to get hold of the ledge and made it halfway before falling in ''Sasuke'' 35.

*'''[[Jessie Graff]]''', a stuntwoman who currently works on the [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'' TV series]]. Previously a pole vaulter in college, she initially competed in multiple seasons of ''American Ninja Warrior'', becoming the first woman to complete Stage 1 in Las Vegas in 2016. In 2017, she became both the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') and Stage 2 at the original Mt. Midoriyama (''Sasuke'' 34). In Stage 3, she went out on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger at the first transition, but not before earning an invitation to the next tournament.

*'''[[Kacy Catanzaro]]''', the first woman in the world to clear the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder while competing in ''American Ninja Warrior'' (''ANW'' 6 in 2014, during the Dallas qualifiers). In 2016, she competed at ''Sasuke'' 32 but narrowly timed out on Stage 1 after passing the Warped Wall.

====Bulgarian athletes====
[[Bulgaria]]n gymnast and six-time Olympian (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) [[Yordan Yovchev]] (spelled on G4 as '''Jordan Jovtchev''') first competed in the 8th competition. During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.

====Taiwanese athletes====
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lee En-Chih|ja|3=リー・エンチ}}''' (who was incorrectly listed as ''Lee Yen Chi'' in the US version and was mistakenly called ''Lee Enchi'' or ''Li En Zhi'' for years), is a professional rock climber from Taiwan. In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away. Li became the third foreigner to reach the Final Stage since [[Yordan Yovchev]] and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8. In ''Sasuke'' 25, he went to the Third Stage, but he failed the Ultimate Cliffhanger. He made it back to the Ultimate Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 26, but again failed there.  In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives. He is also the only foreigner to clear Stage One six times in a row (''Sasuke'' 21–26).

Former [[Pride Fighting Championships]] and [[Pancrase]] Japanese mixed martial artist and pro wrestler [[Ikuhisa Minowa]], competing in [[DREAM (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] known as "Minowaman", was featured in the 26th competition wearing red wrestling tights, pads, and boots. He failed the second obstacle, "Hazard Swing" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the "Long Jump", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM [[Hideo Tokoro]] (announced as a "freelance fighter") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle "Step Slider".

Several professional wrestlers have also competed, including [[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]], [[Masanori Murakawa|The Great Sasuke]] (referred to as ''Great Ninja Warrior'' in the US and UK versions), [[Minoru Suzuki]], [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], [[Kota Ibushi]]  and [[Naohiro Hoshikawa]]. Suzuki and Tanahashi were the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship|Triple Crown Heavyweight]] and [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]], respectively, during their runs in the course.

===Japanese entertainers===
Several Japanese or Japan-based entertainers have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including action movie star [[Kane Kosugi]] and his brother Shane. Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition. He reached the Final Stage in the 8th competition, becoming, alongside [[Yordan Yovchev]], the first foreigner to make it that far. Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Unlike his brother, Shane competed in the 9th competition, where he failed the Big Boulder in the First Stage.

Other entertainers who have competed include {{Interlanguage link multi|Hiromichi Sato|ja|3=佐藤弘道}}, host of several [[NHK]] children's programs; Shigeyuki Nakamura, a champion of the Muscle Gym event in ''[[Kinniku Banzuke]]''; actor-singer Kazumi Morohoshi, a former member of the band Hikaru Genji who is now a solo artist; actor/announcer [[Kenjirō Ishimaru]]; and actors Masaki Nomura and [[Shōei]]. Sato debuted in the 18th tournament and failed the First Stage's Flying Chute. In the 19th tournament, he failed the Log Grip. In the 20th competition, he timed out before he attempted the Tarzan Rope. In the 21st competition, he timed out on the Warped Wall. In the 22nd, Sato finally cleared the First Stage but failed the Metal Spin in the Second. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Metal Spin again. He missed ''Sasuke'' 25, but failed the Jumping Spider again in ''Sasuke'' 26. He missed ''Sasuke'' 27 and 28 but competed in 29, where he shocked the crowd by unexpectedly going out on the first obstacle, the Long Jump. Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Shōei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.

Actor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.

Actor and singer [[Tetsuji Sakakibara]] competed four times (23rd–26th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.

Actor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orugōru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.

[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35.

[[Golden Bomber]] members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in ''Sasuke'' 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In ''Sasuke'' 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting in ''Sasuke'' 35.

He came again to ''Sasuke'' 31, doing better on the Log Grip, but he missed the nets on the Jump Hang Kai. Then he joined ''Sasuke'' 32. He fell on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he tried to get to the red sandbag.

===Japanese comedians===
Several Japanese comedians have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including {{Interlanguage link multi|Akira Omori|ja|3=大森晃|lt=Akira Omori}} ("The Monkey"), [[Koriki Choshu]] ("the most famous gut in Japan" and 2nd on G4's Craziest Contestants Poll), [[Passion Yara]] ("screaming wacko" and 5th on G4s craziest contestants poll), [[Masaki Sumitani]] ("Razor Ramon H.G." or "Hard Gay"), [[Yoku Hata]] ("Guitar Samurai"), [[Tetsurō Degawa]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Kinnikun Nakayama|ja|3=なかやまきんに君}}. Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&amp;nbsp;– for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st–3rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26–28), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka "Mr. Narcissus") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.

Penalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=ワッキー}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.

===Other notable competitors===
65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as "the Octopus" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.

Toyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the "Japanese Bruce Lee" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.

45-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.

===Women in ''Sasuke''===
The first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.&lt;ref&gt;In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.

[[:jp:遊佐雅美|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as "Miyabi" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a "Warrior Wipeout" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.

All three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.

* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4–6)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times – the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.

* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.

* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.

American gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.

Another American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] – the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') – was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament.

===American Ninja Challenges===
{{Main article|American Ninja Challenge}}
In fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28–30 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.

The second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.

The third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&amp;nbsp;– the first woman to qualify&amp;nbsp;– of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.

The fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he "underestimated the cardio" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.

In the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.

==Results==
{{main article|List of Sasuke competitions}}

==List of ''Sasuke'' stages and obstacles==

===Stage 1===
One hundred participants are given the opportunity to attempt the First Stage, a course which primarily tests one's speed. The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.

Typically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.

That goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.

{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names "{{lang|ja|フリークライミング}}"(Free Climbing) and "{{lang|ja|�?登り}}"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the "Mountain Climb" in subtitles.

{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later become the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.

{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Prism See-Saw" is called the "Prism Tilt" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Prism See-Saw."

{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Cross Bridge" is called the "Bridge of Blades" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Cross Bridge."

{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the "Rope Hang," but that name is erroneous.

{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.

{{note|8|8}} As of the 22nd competition, G4 has referred to the Tarzan Rope/Rope Ladder combination as the "Final Climb".

{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.

{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Tackle" is called the "Triple Tackle" in the UK English dub. 

{{note|11|11}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "TIE Fighter" is called the "Prop Slider" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from the Star Wars franchise to use a name associated with a Star Wars character. 
&lt;/div&gt;

===Stage 2===
Those with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.

Unlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as "Mr. ''Sasuke''" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.

On average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;"&gt;
{{note|10|10}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names "{{lang|ja|スパイダーウォーク}}" (Spider Walk), "{{lang|ja|動�??�?}}" (Moving Walls) and "{{lang|ja|スパイダークライム}}" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it "Spider Walk".

{{note|11|11}} The onscreen Japanese graphics "{{lang|ja|五連�?ンマー}}" reveal this obstacle's real name as "Five Continuous Hammers". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.

{{note|12|12}} In those competitions there are two "Moving Walls" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.

{{note|13|13}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Third Stage===
The Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply "sticky spray" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.

Out of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|15|15}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Pole Bridge" is called the "Pillar Path" in subtitles. But the English version and the Japanese announcer call them the "Pole Bridge."

{{note|16|16}} The onscreen Japanese graphics ({{lang|ja|�?山}}) reveal this obstacle's real name as "Pincushion"; on ''Ninja Warrior,'' it's called "Eye of the Needle."

{{note|17|17}} The onscreen Japanese graphics ({{lang|ja|�?ングムーブ}}) reveal this obstacle's real name as "Hang Move"; on ''Ninja Warrior,'' it's called "Chain Swing".

{{note|18|18}} ''Ninja Warrior'' calls the "Pole Jump" the "Super Vault."

{{note|19|19}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Climbing Bars" are called the "Bridge of Destiny" in subtitles. But the English version and the Japanese announcer call them the "Climbing Bars," one of the many [[gairaigo]] (words borrowed from [[English language|English]]) used to describe ''Sasuke'' obstacles.

{{note|20|20}} In the 19th and 20th this obstacle was the Sending Climber, but in the 21st they changed the obstacle and the name to Hang Climbing. G4 calls it Ascending Climb.

{{note|21|21}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Lamp Grasper" is called the "Globe Grasp" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Lamp Grasper."

{{note|22|22}} The Kudari Lamp Grasper is also called the Descending Lamp Grasper. G4 continues to call it the "Globe Grasp."

{{note|23|23}} The Vertical Limit Kai was modified to have three separate sections instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Final Stage===
To date, the Final Stage has known six forms. Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|完全制覇}}), translated roughly as "complete domination", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as "total victory". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.

Of all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.

The original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15 meter (49&amp;nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.

The second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.

The third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} "Heavenly Ladder" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} "G Rope." The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.

The fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20 meter (66&amp;nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5 meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.

The fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&amp;nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.

For the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18–24 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7–17 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&amp;nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (スパイダークライム) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&amp;nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (綱登り) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&amp;nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&amp;nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35 second Final Stage is not out of the question.

The prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|¥]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|¥]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.

Typically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|24|24}} According to the Sasuke Mania Official Site, the official Japanese names for the ropes in 1st–4th, 5th–17th, and 25th–27th are "{{lang|ja|15m綱登り}}", "{{lang|ja|10m綱登り}}" and "{{lang|ja|20m綱登り}}" respectively, in which "{{lang|ja|綱登り}}" means "Rope Climb". ''Ninja Warrior'' just calls them "Rope Climb", without the length of the ropes.

{{note|25|25}}  If the "Spider Climb" is not completed in fifteen seconds, the walls start to slide back, making it harder to traverse, and finally impossible if not completed soon after.

&lt;/div&gt;

===United States===
{{further information|American Ninja Warrior}}
The program previously aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] in the United States under the name '''''Ninja Warrior'''''. Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the "Ninja Killer" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and "Warrior Wipeout" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].

The show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.

As of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that "Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants." and that they "...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles." Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that "Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year."

====''American Ninja Warrior''====

{{main article|American Ninja Warrior}}
The popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.

The qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.

''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.

A second season was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a "boot camp" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.

After boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.

The third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael "Frosti" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David "Young Flip" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.

Of the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.

A fourth season of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&amp;nbsp;– regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.

The show returned for its fifth season on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its sixth season on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its seventh season in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff – ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;) The network has renewed the show once again for its eighth season in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its ninth season in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The tenth season of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall.

=====''USA vs Japan''=====
{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan .282014-Present.29|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}

In 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.

At the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&amp;nbsp;– one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6–0 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)

=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====
{{main article|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}

With the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015. The spin-off consists of 24 teams of three members featuring past and current ''ANW'' contestants from the first seven seasons.

In 2018 the network renamed the show to ''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja'' with Iseman, Biama, and Curry as hosts and new teams for its third season.

===== ''American Ninja Warrior Junior'' =====
{{main article|American Ninja Warrior Junior}}
On May 2, 2018, Universal Kids announced a second spin-off called ''American Ninja Warrior Junior''. The spin-off consists of 192 kids from across America as they compete head to head in three different age brackets: 9-10, 11-12, and 13-14 years old. Each bracket will be mentored by All-Star Ninja Mentors: Drew Dreschel, Barclay Stockett, Kevin Bull, Natalie Duran, Najee Richardson and Meagan Martin. The series began airing on October 13, 2018, with Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, joined by Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez as hosts.

===United Kingdom===
The American-edited ''Ninja Warrior'' episodes are broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]]. The show has been re-edited to remove the subtitles from the footage of the competitors taking part in the stages, but retain them for contestant interviews. The "Ninja Killer" and "Warrior Wipeout" sections remain, but there is only one advertisement break halfway through the show.

The show was voiced-over by [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] for its first three series, aired between 2007 and 2008. In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over. Challenge has now removed Hall's commentary from the first three series, following his imprisonment in June 2013, and re-dubbed them with new commentary by North. As of July 2012, all American edited episodes, covering all tournaments up to ''Sasuke'' 27, had aired in the UK. A new run of edited episodes airing in March 2016 was produced in the UK for Challenge, covering the ''Sasuke Rising'' tournaments, once again voiced by North. Another run of brand new edited episodes airing in June 2018 was again produced in the UK for Challenge, covering ''Sasuke'' tournaments 31–34, also voiced by North.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Tantei Opera Milky Holmes characters}}
Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as {{nihongo|Toys|トイズ|Toizu}}. Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the [[Yokohama]] District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Burton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.

The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Arséne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The ''Alternative'' TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.

In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try and regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. ''Futari wa Milky Holmes'', which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. ''Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD'' sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.

===Other appearances===
The four main characters of Milky Holmes appear briefly in many different episodes of ''[[Cardfight!! Vanguard]]'' as cameos where they are simply shown in the background. The voice actresses also make a cameo as the Milky Holmes in episode 23 of [[Fire Leon]], a live action series also produced by Bushiroad. In this scene, Suzuko Mimori portrays both Sherlock Shellingford and Yû Kusayanagi, a recurring character of the series. Additionally, the character "Sherlock "Sheryl" Shellingford" appears as a "guest" partner in the Japanese MMORPG Onigiri Online.

===Movie===
An idea of a movie adaptation was first teased in the form of clues hidden within the end cards of the delayed fifth episode of ''Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD'' for fans to solve. [[Tokyo MX]], [[TV Kanagawa]], [[Hokuriku Broadcasting Company|Hokuriku Broadcasting]], [[TV Aichi]] and [[Sun Television|Sun TV]] aired the same episode in different regions, but showed a different pair of letters in the end card, which when rearranged vertically could be read as "Milky Movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-02-22/detective-opera-milky-holmes-movie-teased/.85290|title=Detective Opera Milky Holmes 'Movie' Teased|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2015-02-22|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leak also emerged from the Japanese retail website Gamers' listing for the April issue of ''Monthly Bushiroad'' magazine, which included an image sample of a bundled publicity image extra which said "Milky Holmes movie adaptation planning start!!" The image has since been taken down from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-24/gamers-retail-website-lists-milky-holmes-movie-project/.85322|title=Gamers Retail Website Lists Milky Holmes Movie Project|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2015-02-24|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the project was officially revealed later in a special edition of ''Miru Miru Milky'', a variety show starring the main voice actors, and confirmed by the Milky Holmes official website the next day. However, it was also announced that they need support from the fans to realize its production, meaning the project hasn't gotten greenlit for production yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/02/26-1/milky-holmes-movie-project-needs-support-from-the-fans|title="Milky Holmes" Movie Project Needs Support from the Fans|publisher=Crunchyroll|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milky-holmes.com/news/2015/02/26/1974|script-title=ja:「ミルキィホームズ映画化企画」スタート|publisher=Milky Holmes Official Website|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-03-31|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Beatles history}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
{{Use British English|date=November 2010}}{{italic title}}
'''''The Beatles Anthology''''' is a [[television documentary]], a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of [[the Beatles]]. [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Anthology'' project, while [[John Lennon]] had archival interviews.

The documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in 1996 and on [[DVD]] in 2003. The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. The [[The Beatles Anthology (book)|''Anthology'' book]], released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.

The initial volume of the album set (''[[Anthology 1]]'') was released the same week of the documentary's airdate, with the subsequent two volumes (''[[Anthology 2]]'' and ''[[Anthology 3]]'') released in 1996. They included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by Lennon after the group broke up: "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (Beatles song)|Real Love]]", both produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].

==Documentary series==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (TV series)}}
Approximately coinciding with the release of the "[[Free as a Bird]]" single and ''[[Anthology 1]]'' album (the first of three double-CD albums), ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of documentaries was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the United Kingdom and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States in 1995. The ''Anthology'' series takes a form similar to that of the ''Anthology'' book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external "objective" narration.  Footage in the ''Anthology'' series features [[voice-over]] recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series; [[John Lennon]] appears only in historic archival footage.  The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's song "Something").

The series, which was made over five thousand hours of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives. When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995. The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).

Air dates on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:

* Sunday, 19 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Wednesday, 22 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Thursday, 23 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.

Part 1 of the series drew 17 million households,&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;Kaltenbach, Chris. "[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-12-03/news/1995337214_1_beatles-anthology-part-2 Beatles' appeal appears limited Ho-hum: Millions of people tuned in to the three-part 'Anthology' on ABC, but many more were watching other shows]." ''The Baltimore Sun''. 1995-12-03. Retrieved 2015-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-29/entertainment/ca-8209_1_beatles-anthology|title=TV Ratings :  'Beatles' Fades; 'Football,' With Elvis, Is No. 1|first=LEE|last=MARGULIES|date=29 November 1995|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of ''[[Friends]]'' on [[NBC]],&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt; which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.

In promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as "A-Beatles-C" – an homage to the mid-1960s [[Cousin Felica]]-era "77 W-A-Beatles-C" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station – and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.

==Albums==
{{Main|Anthology 1|Anthology 2|Anthology 3}}
To accompany the ''Anthology'' series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] for many years prior.

Two days after the first television special in the series had aired, ''[[Anthology 1]]'' was released to stores, and included music recorded by [[the Quarrymen]], the famous [[Decca Records]] [[The Decca audition|audition tapes]], and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums. It also included the song "Lend Me Your Comb", omitted from the collection ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]'', released the previous year (1994). The song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of ''Anthology 1'' were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The band's first drummer [[Pete Best]], replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.

''[[Anthology 2]]'' was released on 17 March 1996. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for ''[[Help!]]'', ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" – which, like "Free as a Bird", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording – was also included in the two-CD collection.

''[[Anthology 3]]'' was released on 28 October 1996. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' ("White Album"), ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]'', as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.

===Collage===
[[File:Anthology cover collage.jpg|center|Collage of the three covers of ''The Beatles Anthology'', created by [[Klaus Voormann]].]]

The three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career. This was the work of [[Klaus Voormann]], who also created the album cover for ''Revolver'' in 1966. The ''Anthology'' covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for ''Revolver'' within the collage. During the music video for "[[Free as a Bird]]", the ''Anthology'' collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street. The design also adorned the VHS, [[laserdisc]] and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side.  Upon the release of ''Anthology 3'', [[HMV]] stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.

===Digital release and ''Anthology Highlights''===
All three albums were made digitally available on the [[iTunes]] Store on 14 June 2011, alongside a new ''Anthology Highlights'' album which featured a selection of tracks from all three albums and reached number 184 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s United States [[Billboard charts#Albums|Top Current Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2011-07-02/current-albums|title=Top Current Albums|date=2 July 2011|website=[[Billboard.biz]]|accessdate=12 October 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (book)}}

[[File:erw.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''The Beatles Anthology'' paperback book]]

In October 2000, ''The Beatles Anthology'' book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos. Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films. The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts. The book went straight to the top of the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestsellers list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/2000/2000-10-22.pdf The ''New York Times'' Best Seller List - 22 October 2000]. From Hawes.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2002/12/08/the-beatles-anthology-publish/5881b4c7-2dd0-445b-8fbe-f4ce665d6c3c/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Carnival of Light|Now and Then (John Lennon song)}}

During early 1995 as work on ''The Beatles Anthology'' continued, [[Yoko Ono]] and McCartney recorded an [[avant-garde]] piece called "Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue". Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while [[Sean Lennon]], [[Linda McCartney]], and McCartney's children played various instruments. The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A new song for history |date=4 August 1995 |agency=AP |newspaper=Times Daily |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PV8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E8kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2618,562306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track "[[Carnival of Light]]" recorded during the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' sessions was intended to be released on the ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/carnival-of-light/2/ |title=Carnival of Light |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called "All for Love" in March 1995, intended as a track on ''Anthology 3'', but the effort was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |title=More on "All For Love" -- what Paul really said (with pictures) |publisher=Abbeyrd.best.vwh.net |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128100439/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; No version of the song has reached the public.

==Promotional items==
Each of the three ''Anthology'' albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates. These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items. Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for ''Anthology 2'', which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).

In October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from [[EMI]], a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.

==Parodies==
The success of the ''Anthology'' albums was parodied by the release of the [[The Rutles|Rutles]]' ''[[The Rutles Archaeology|Archaeology]]'' some months later. Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] parodied ''The Beatles Anthology'' in an ''[[Al TV]]'' special. He said he had a copy of a fictional ''Anthology 17'', which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while. He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

''The Beatles Anthology'' was also parodied on the short-lived ''[[Dana Carvey Show]]'', which was being aired on [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] around the same time that ''Anthology'' was being televised on the network.

'''The California Raisins''' were a [[fictional]] [[rhythm and blues]] [[virtual band|animated musical group]] as well as [[advertising character|advertising]] and merchandising characters composed of  [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[raisins]]. Lead vocals were sung by musician [[Buddy Miles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/arts/music/28cnd-miles.html?hp |title= Buddy Miles, Hendrix Drummer, Dies |first= Jon |last= Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Raisins concept experienced high popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s principally through [[clay animation|claymation]] [[Television advertisement|TV commercials]] and [[animation|animated]] [[television special|specials]], winning an [[Emmy Award]] and one nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/21/arts/tv-review-claymation-christmas-on-cbs.html |title=TV Review; 'Claymation Christmas,' On CBS |work= The New York Times |date=December 21, 1987 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-12/news/tv-509_1_california-raisins |title=On View: A Feat of Clay: The Creator of California Raisins Molds an Animated Easter Special |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 12, 1992 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and success==
The concept was originally created for a 1986 [[Sun-Maid]] commercial on behalf of the [[California Raisin Advisory Board]] when one of the writers, Seth Werner (at the time with the advertising firm Foote, Cone &amp; Belding SF, and now with big) came up with an idea for the new raisin commercial, saying, "We have tried everything but dancing raisins singing '[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]'" (the 1968 song popularized by [[Marvin Gaye]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Stardom Is Feat Of Clay For California Raisins|work= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|date= January 25, 1988 |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-01-25/lifestyle/0010260008_1_california-raisins-stardom-critical-acclaim|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To their surprise, the commercial became wildly popular, paving the way for several future commercials and opportunities through other media. The commercials were produced by [[Will Vinton|Vinton Studios]] using their [[claymation]] technique, with character designs by Michael Brunsfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Corliss |first= Richard |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/18/bad-25-spike-lee-brings-michael-jackson-back-to-thrilling-life/ |title= Bad 25: Spike Lee Brings Michael Jackson Back to Thrilling Life |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Raisins appeared in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[A Claymation Christmas Celebration]]'', singing the [[Christmas carol]] "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]".

The California Raisins released four [[studio album]]s on [[Priority Records]] between 1987 and 1988, and their signature song, "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," landed on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, the Raisins would continue to make their strongest impression through animated endeavors, and the characters proved popular enough that they were used to endorse [[Post Consumer Brands|Post]]'s [[Raisin Bran]] cereal.

On November 4, 1988, [[CBS]] aired a primetime special entitled ''[[Meet the Raisins!]]''. The musical [[mockumentary]] was again created by Vinton Studios and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Primetime Emmy Award]]. It also provided the band members more personality and individual names: A.C., Beebop (drums), Stretch (bass), and Red (guitar/piano). A [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] series, ''[[The California Raisin Show]]'', debuted the following year but lasted merely 13 episodes. While [[cel animation|cel animated]] by [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson]], it maintained Will Vinton's creative direction. A sequel to the original CBS special aired in 1990 under the title ''The Raisins: Sold Out!: The California Raisins II''. This special saw the Raisins hiring a new manager with the goal of making a comeback.

==Merchandise==
Many of the items created for the campaign have become part of the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Merchandise sales included toys and Raisins images on nearly every conceivable medium: [[lunch box]]es, notebooks, clothing, [[posters]], bedsheets, and even a [[Halloween costume]] just to name a few. A California Raisins Fan Club began in 1987 which included a Grapevine Gazette Newsletter and various memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wharble.com/California_Raisins_Collectibles.htm |title= California Raisins Collectibles |work= Wharble.com |access-date= May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blackthorne Publishing]] also released a 6-issue [[comic book]] series entitled ''The California Raisins 3-D'' which included [[Stereoscopy#3D viewers|3D glasses]]; these would later be re-released in the ''Ultimate Collection'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].

Several California Raisins music albums were also released, featuring classic [[Motown]] and rock standards. These albums were included in the Smithsonian collection and were illustrated and art-directed by [[Helane Freeman]], who later became famous for her work on ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'', among other [[Disney]] programs.

Perhaps the most memorable piece of California Raisins merchandise, however, came in the form of small, non-poseable California Raisins figures. The [[Hardee's]] restaurant chain offered these as part of a promotion for their Cinnamon 'N' Raisin biscuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hardees.com/company/story/ |title= The Hardee's Story |publisher= Hardees |access-date= June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different collections were produced in 1987, 1988, 1991, and finally in 2001 (the latter adding [[Carls Jr.]] due to their late '90s acquisition of Hardee's) for their new stylization. This latest incarnation can still be seen on the California Raisin Marketing Board website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calraisins.org/raisins_home/ CalRaisins.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, [[Capcom]] produced a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] titled ''[[The California Raisins: The Grape Escape]]'',&lt;ref name="NP-9"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher = [[Nintendo]]| title = Pak Watch| page = 95| author = Nintendo Power Staff|date=November–December 1989| issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five [[side-scrolling]] levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins' music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.

==Decline==
Although popular with the public, the California Raisin campaign eventually failed because its production cost the raisin growers almost twice their earnings. [[California Raisin Advisory Board|CALRAB]], the organization who made the campaign, was also closed on July 31, 1994 due to disagreements with raisin producers over the fairness of required payments to the organization.

==Post-popularity and legacy==
On March 28, 1997 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' published "The 50 Best Commercials of All Time" as its [[Front cover|cover story]]. The article ranked The California Raisins' premiere advertisement, "Lunchbox," at #15 with comments by ad agency executive Claude Jacques and described the Raisins as "The coolest wrinkled musicians this side of the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287305_2,00.html |title= The 50 Best Commercials of All Time |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= March 28, 1997 |access-date= May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast amount of California Raisins merchandise has made for a substantial collectors' market. It even led to an unauthorized collectibles guide published in 1998, cataloging the many items based on the clay characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Collectible-California-Raisins-Unauthorized-Collectors/dp/076430433X |title= Collectible California Raisins: An Unauthorized Guide With Values |work= Amazon.com |access-date= May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Food Network]] program ''[[Unwrapped]]'' featured a segment on The California Raisins featuring interviews with [[Will Vinton]], David Altschul, and Mark Gustafson of Vinton Studios. Concept illustrations of the Raisins were also featured as interviewees discussed the characters' creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDN_C70xpZ8 |work= Unwrapped |title= The California Raisins |via= YouTube |access-date= June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[['Tis the Fifteenth Season]]", The California Raisins were spoofed as ''The California Prunes'', on a special entitled ''Christmas with the California Prunes''. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] dismisses it as "offensive to both [[Christians]] ''and'' prunes."

An article published by AnimateClay.com in the late 2000s details the whereabouts of the original claymation sculptures used by Vinton Studios. The figures were kept in a box for several years and headed for the trash before being obtained by Webster Colcord, a former employee of Vinton. Several photos were taken providing a close look at the Raisins' internal armatures and detailing their extremely poor condition, including the absence of the A.C. puppet's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Spess |first= Marc |url= http://www.animateclay.com/index.php/articles/69-behind-the-scenes/119-california-raisin-raisin-puppets-late-80s-early-90s |title= California Raisin Raisin Puppets: Late 80's - Early 90's |work= AnimateClay.com |date= April 18, 2010 |access-date= May 15, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143703/http://www.animateclay.com/index.php/articles/69-behind-the-scenes/119-california-raisin-raisin-puppets-late-80s-early-90s |archivedate= July 7, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010s, packages of [[Sun-Maid]] Natural California Raisins still modestly feature an updated California Raisin character. This figure is also included on [http://www.calraisins.org/ CalRaisins.org].

In 2010, [[Clay animation|claymation]] versions of the California Raisins were featured in the special [[Christmas]] episode of ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', '"A Very Sunny Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Zingale |first= Jason |url= http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2009/11/21/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-a-very-sunny-christmas/ |title= It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas |work= Premium Hollywood |date= November 21, 2009 |access-date= September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the California Raisins made a cameo appearance in the [[RadioShack]] [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] commercial "[[The '80s Called]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/tv/radioshack-super-bowl-commercial-every-80s-reference-in-the-ad-spot/ |title=Celebrating Every '80s Reference in That RadioShack Super Bowl Commercial |author=Jones, Nate |publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' called "[[The Cad and the Hat]]" included a couch gag segment featuring the California Raisins being killed by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Animation on FOX|title=Robot Chicken Couch Gag, Season 28 Ep. 14, ''The Simpsons'' |date=February 16, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzLju-4Su8|accessdate=February 23, 2017 |via= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an episode of ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'' called "[[Rififi (The Americans)|Rififi]]" feature a cereal box featuring the California Raisins on the back.

===Planned film===
In 2015, it was announced that a live-action/CGI reboot of the California Raisins would be produced, with president of The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation, Rusty Citron, as one of the people behind the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/california-raisins-set-for-comeback-in-live-actioncg-feature-exclusive-110510.html |title= California Raisins Set for Comeback in Live-Action Feature |work= Cartoon Brew.com |access-date= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy''''' (also known as '''''Billy &amp; Mandy''''') is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[Maxwell Atoms]] for [[Cartoon Network]], and is the 14th of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]] (albeit on when it was part of ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', due to the ''Cartoon Cartoons'' brand being temporarily discontinued earlier in June 2003; the show itself is considered by some to still be a ''Cartoon Cartoon'' show regardless). It follows two children named Billy—a slow-witted happy-go-lucky boy—and Mandy—his dark and cynical best friend—who, after winning a [[Limbo (dance)|limbo]] game to save Billy's pet hamster, gain the mighty [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] as their best friend in eternal servitude and slavery.

''Billy &amp; Mandy'' began as a series of segments on ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', from which it was spun-off, along with ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', on August 24, 2001. The show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003 to November 9, 2007, but a telefilm, titled ''[[Underfist: Halloween Bash]]'', aired on October 12, 2008, officially bringing the series to a close. In addition to the episodes, three movies, two special episodes, and nineteen shorts were made, with 3 award wins for the series as a whole. ''Billy &amp; Mandy'' has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise. Reruns can currently be seen on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

[[File:Aretxabaleta - graffiti 07.JPG|thumb|left|Graffiti of Grim Reaper in [[Aretxabaleta]] ([[Spain]])]]
The series is centered around the exploits of  Billy (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz]]), a completely idiotic and happy-go-lucky boy; Mandy ([[Grey DeLisle]]), a cynical and merciless girl, and Grim ([[Greg Eagles]]), the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] who is often tormented by the duo. After cheating at a limbo match against Grim (in retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he is enslaved in a permanently  unwanted friendship with the children.&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/billymandy/characters/index.html|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy Characters|work=[[Cartoon Network]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a [[love-hate relationship]] with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude.

Billy and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the [[Underworld]], or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional monsters including [[Dracula]], the [[Wolfman]], and the [[bogeyman]] are also comically depicted in the series.

Supporting characters include Irwin ([[Vanessa Marshall]]), a nerdy awkward boy who has a crush on Mandy; Harold (Richard Steven Horvitz), Billy's father who is even dumber than his son; Gladys (Jennifer Hale), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy ([[Rachael MacFarlane]]), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg (Greg Eagles), the local [[bully]] who has a sensitive side; Fred Fredburger ([[C.H. Greenblatt]]), a simple-minded, irritating underworld creature who loves frozen yogurt and nachos; Dracula ([[Phil LaMarr]]), a selfish elderly vampire who's revealed to be Irwin's paternal grandfather in the final season of the show.

The show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the show together.

==History==
The series had its genesis in 1995, when Maxwell Atoms, while he was a junior at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, made a two-minute short film for his thesis project. Titled ''Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You'', it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing [[trepanning]] with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the first annual TromAnimation Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Maxwell Atoms Reveals Lost Student Film That Inspired 'Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy'|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/maxwell-atoms-reveals-student-film-inspired-grim-adventures-billy-mandy-139336.html|accessdate=2 May 2016|work=Cartoon Brew|date=1 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage, on his YouTube channel.

The show's existence is the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called ''[[Cartoon Network's Big Pick]]'' which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000.&lt;ref name="AWN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/billy-mandy-and-grim-head-movies|title=Billy, Mandy and Grim Head to the Movies|work=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three final choices were ''Grim and Evil'' (later splitting into two separate series: ''The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy'' and ''Evil Con Carne''), ''[[Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?]]'' and ''Longhair and Doubledome''.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt; Out of the three, ''Grim and Evil'' attained the most votes with 57%; ''Robot Jones'' came in second place at 23% while ''Longhair and Doubledome'' received 20% of the vote.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/toon-net-oks-series-based-on-aud-votes-1117785699/|title='Billy &amp; Mandy' beats out 'Robot,' 'Longhair' to get greenlight|first=John|last=Dempsey|date=August 29, 2000|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally part of ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', ''Billy &amp; Mandy'' served as the main show. In each episode, an ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'' short was put between two ''Grim'' shorts.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt; On occasion, it was the other way around, with two ''Evil'' shorts and one ''Grim'' short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the ''Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend''.

On June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave each their own full-length program. The short-lived ''Evil Con Carne'' show was cancelled once the already-produced season had aired. Some characters from ''Evil Con Carne'' occasionally appeared on ''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy''. General Skarr become an official character on the show in the episode "Skarred for Life", where he becomes Billy's new next-door neighbor, and in "Company Halt", the ninth episode of the final season which functions as the true series finale for ''Evil Con Carne'', Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization and convince Skarr to join them, but their plans are ultimately foiled by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal person.

A second movie, ''Wrath of the Spider Queen'', was also released in 2007. It was based on a spider queen from Grim's distant past, who tries to take revenge on him because she was meant to be the reaper. Meanwhile, keeping up with the spider theme, Billy learns to love his spider son Jeff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1075544/combined|title=Wrath of the Spider Queen|work=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video game===
{{Main|The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy (video game)}}
A video game inspired by the series was developed by [[Midway Games]], and released on October 2, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ADM231785/|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy (Video game)|work=[[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 3D fighting game. The video game received fair to good reviews: [[GameSpot]] gave it a 6.6/10 by Greg Mueller, he goes on to say that while it is fun for the "first few hours" and has "Fast-paced gameplay" the game action "gets old quickly" and has a very short story mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/the-grim-adventures-of-billy-and-mandy/reviews/the-grim-adventures-of-billy-and-mandy-review-6162195/|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy Review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave the game a good score of 7.2/10 highlighting its presentation and appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/739/739790p1.html|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy (Video game review)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the game a rating of 61/100 based on 10 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/the-grim-adventures-of-billy-mandy|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy Wii|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The franchise began June 16, 1998 with the release of the PlayStation game [[Tokyo Majin Gakuen: Ken Kaze Tobari|''Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuuchou'']]. It proved to be the first in the ''Gakuen Denki'' game series in Japan.

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Aristotle and Tragicomedy."''

===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy. I don't think it would be appropriate to make it consistently a comedy, when there are kings and gods in it. What do you think? Since a slave also has a part in the play, I'll make it a tragicomedy...{{emdash}}{{small|[[Plautus]], ''[[Amphitryon]]''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plautus|others=Eds.

====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

{{For|the term "turkey" in the general sport of bowling|Strike (bowling)#Consecutive strikes}}
'''Turkey bowling''' is a [[sport]] which is based on ordinary [[bowling]]: a [[frozen foods|frozen]] [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] serves as a [[bowling ball]] and 10 plastic bottles of [[soft drink]]s or water are the [[bowling pin]]s. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface, for example, ice or a soap covered sheet of painters plastic (using a bar of soap).&lt;ref name=men3-11-03&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/71/71914_protestors_cry_foul_at_turkey_bowling.html "Protestors cry foul at turkey bowling"], ''[[Manchester Evening News]],'' 3/11/2003&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated with [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losalamosnm.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B942433DE-4B1B-4DF9-826E-379B5E464E9A%7D&amp;DE=%7BCCD085E5-D37A-4AB7-AD20-F90412773255%7D]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=39856 "It's a Strike, a Spare. It's Turkey Bowling"], November 24, 2008 ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey bowling is popular in [[minor league]] [[ice hockey]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt;

The original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a [[grocery store]]. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a [[Newport Beach]] [[Lucky's]] branch, while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.&lt;ref name=people&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118874,00.html "Derrick Johnson's Unique Bowling Style Is Pure Poultry in Motion"], ''[[People Magazine]],'' October 01, 1990 Vol. 34 No. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick became a self-appointed [[commissioner]] of the "[[Poultry]] Bowlers Association" and codified the rules and terminology, such as "the [[fowl]] line" (cf. "[[Ten-pin bowling|foul line]]"), "the [[gobbler]]" (three strikes in a row; cf. [[turkey (bowling)]]), "the [[Butterball]]" (a gutterball) and "the [[Furcula|wishbone]]" (a [[7-10 split]]).&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

==Notable occurrences==
Turkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel ''[[Bloodsucking Fiends]]: A Love Story''  by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]], where it was the favorite sport of "The Animals", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels ''[[You Suck]]: A Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2007-01-22-you-suck-fangland_x.htm "'You Suck,' 'Fangland' take vampires in new directions"], a ''[[USA Today]]'' book review&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bite Me: A Love Story|Bite Me]]'').

[[List of 10 Items or Less episodes|Episode 14]] of ''[[10 Items or Less (TV series)|10 Items or Less]]'' TV series was "Turkey Bowling".&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1307081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Guy's Grocery Games]]'' episode "Frozen Food Fight" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.

Every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] morning, Cleveland's Fox affiliate [[WJW-TV]] does its annual Turkey Bowl from a [[Giant Eagle]] store in the Greater [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of [[Canning|canned]] [[cranberry sauce]], [[cup stacking|stacked]] in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round [[single-elimination tournament|knockout tournament]] format. In the 2010 edition it was hosted by morning features and man about town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's [[Breakfast television|morning newscast]]. The broadcast began in 1999.

==Controversy==
[[Animal rights]] proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people.&lt;ref name=cjo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/111898/kan_turkeybowling.shtml |title=Group hopes to stuff turkey bowling |publisher=Cjonline.com |date=1998-11-18 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=cjo/&gt;    In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of [[UK]] Great Turkey Bowling Champion at [[Manchester Arena|Manchester Evening News Arena]] was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys.&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt; In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2007/11/22/regional%20news/19048960.txt |title=Norman the turkey will live past Thanksgiving, rescue group says |publisher=Dailyfreeman.com |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - i.e. - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar, by [[James Gillray]] (1797)]]

'''Wit''' is a form of intelligent [[humour]], the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/wit|title=Wit|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''wit''' is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wit|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/wit|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of wit include the '''quip''', '''repartee''', and '''wisecrack'''.

==Forms==
As in the wit of [[Dorothy Parker]]'s set, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many [[epigram]]s), and perhaps more [[genius|ingenious]] than funny.

A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into [[sarcasm]], or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. ([[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]: "I wish I'd said that." [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]: "You will, Oscar, you will".)&lt;ref&gt;Monty Python: Oscar Wilde sketch&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Wit in [[poetry]] is characteristic of [[metaphysical poetry]] as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who admonished pretension with the phrase "Better a witty fool than a foolish wit".&lt;ref name="Salingar1976"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Salingar
|first=Leo
|title=Shakespeare and the Traditions of Comedy
|url=
|year=1976
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|isbn=978-0-521-29113-2
|pages=245–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may combine [[word play]] with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet [[John Donne]] is the representative of this style of poetry.&lt;ref name="Daley1990"&gt;{{cite book

|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further meanings==
More generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit &amp;mdash; meaning the wits with which one is born &amp;mdash; is closely synonymous with [[common sense]]. To live by one's wits is to be an [[Opportunism|opportunist]], but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick [[reasoning]].  To be at the end of one's wits ("I'm at my wits' end") is to be immensely [[Frustration|frustrated]].
