The KYW call letters originally went from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to Cleveland in 1956, and back to Philadelphia with the reversal, with NBC renaming the Cleveland stations [[WTAM|WKYC AM]]/[[WMJI|FM]]/[[WKYC|TV]].
*18 August: [[Marlene Dietrich]] appears in "The Child" for [[BBC]] radio.

*12 December: New owner Westchester Broadcasting changes the call letters of WDOK (AM) in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to WIXY, installing a Top 40 format (today known as [[WCCR (AM)|WCCR]]). Their FM sister station retains the [[WDOK]] calls and [[beautiful music]] format.

===Unknown Dates===

==Debuts==

'''Advanced Placement [[History of the United States|United States History]]''' (also known as '''AP U.S. History''' or '''APUSH''') is a course and examination offered by [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==Curriculum==

The AP U.S. History course is designed to provide the same level of content and instruction that students would face in a freshman-level college survey class. AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.

===Textbooks===
Commonly used textbooks that meet the curriculum requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/html/apcourseaudit/courses/us_history_textbook_list.html |title=AP United States History: Example Textbook List |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

*''Out of Many'' (Faragher ''et al.'')
*''A People and a Nation'' ([[Mary Beth Norton|Norton]] ''et al.'')

===Conservative criticism===
[[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] have criticized the curriculum for downplaying [[American exceptionalism]] and failing to foster patriotism. In 2014, [[2014 Jefferson County Public Schools protests|there were protests against it]] in the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County Public Schools district]] in Colorado. In 2015, a bill to replace the curriculum was passed by the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]]’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ap-us-history-controversy-becomes-a-debate-on-america-115381.html|title=AP U.S. History controversy becomes a debate on America -|last=Lerner|first=Adam B.|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Politico]]|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/23/oklahoma-legislature-targets-ap-us-history-framework-being-negative |title=Oklahoma Board of Education targets US History course for being "negative"|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
The AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts.  Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from [[Pre-Columbian era|just before European contact with Native Americans]] to the present day. Moreover, section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.

Section II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two [[Essay|essays]]. Section II, part A, is a [[document-based question]] (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. 

Each long essay essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical thinking skills: patterns of continuity and change over time, comparison, or causation. Both of the essay questions will address the same historical thinking skill. In addition, neither essay's time frame will be exclusively before 1607 (the founding of Jamestown) or after 1980 (President Reagan's election). There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm; but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.&lt;ref name="Exam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf |title=AP US History: Course and Exam Description |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide,&lt;ref name="2011 Scores"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/2011_US_History_Score_Dist.pdf |title=AP United States History Student Score Distributions Global AP Exams - May 2011 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|title=AP Data – Archived Data 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401102514/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|archive-date=2013-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.&lt;ref name="Exam"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39639">The '''African-American heritage of United States presidents''' relates mostly to questions and claims made by amateur historians as to whether five presidents of the United States who were accepted as white also had significant recent African ancestry. There is no disagreement that President [[Barack Obama]] (2009–2017) had a [[Kenyan]] father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. (She and Obama are thought also to be descended from the African indentured servant known in colonial records as [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]].) The academic consensus of historians is that no president other than Obama has had recent (from the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period in U.S. history]] or after) African ancestry; it rejects claims to the contrary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

These claims have been made by the historian [[William Estabrook Chancellor]], amateur historian [[J. A.

All but Chancellor base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, J.

== Significance of claims ==
{{See also|Slavery in the United States}}

Citizenship and associated claims have split on two dimensions: formal legal citizenship, and full social and political citizenship. While claims of African ancestry may have created social scandal (and that varied in time and place), even in Thomas Jefferson's time, a person of less than one-quarter African ancestry could be considered legally white. Later this was changed so that a person had to have at least seven-eighths European ancestry to be legally white. Jefferson's mixed-race children from his relationship with [[Sally Hemings]], were seven-eighths white.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Gordon-Reed, ''The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family'', New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample evidence in historical records that people of mixed race were accepted as white and full citizens in communities, as they were documented as exercising the rights of citizens to bear arms and vote.  Social acceptance by the majority-white community was often the key as to whether a person was considered white, more than details about ancestry, especially in early periods on the frontier when few records were kept and people often did not know much about their origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html Ariela Gross, "Of Portuguese Origin": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the "Little Races" in Nineteenth-Century America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512143936/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=2008-05-12 }}, ''Law and History Review'', Vol. 25 (3), Fall 2007, accessed June 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This classification of ancestry and social class was separate from the legal status derived from ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', the law that made children born to slave mothers also slaves. This law hardened slavery as a racial caste system. But, it was not until after the end of slavery and regaining of power by conservative whites in the late 19th-century [[South]] that they passed laws to create racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]. From 1890 to 1908, southern states of the former Confederacy passed constitutional amendments and legislation making voter registration more difficult, essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchising]] most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''Struggle for Mastery:Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, '' The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Such disfranchisement essentially lasted until the civil rights movement gained Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to protect constitutional rights of citizens to vote.

In the early 20th century, southern states tried to find more ways to enforce [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Beginning with Tennessee in 1910, through Oklahoma in 1931, most southern states adopted the [[one-drop rule]], and hardened racial lines so that a person of any African ancestry was to be recorded as and considered as black in the binary society. During the same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old "blood fraction" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Murray (ed.), ''States’ Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, United States historians have more thoroughly explored the years of slavery and opened up discussion of race relations. They have noted that numerous mixed-race families of varying proportions of European and African ancestry developed in colonial and antebellum United States. In award-winning research, Paul Heinegg traced the ancestry of free black families in [[North Carolina]] in the 1790 census, finding that most were descended from [[free people of color]] in colonial [[Virginia]] who migrated to other areas. They were mostly descendants of unions between white women, indentured servant or free, and African men, slave, indentured or free, from years when associations among the working class were fluid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1998–2005, February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Dr. [[Ira Berlin]] praised Heinegg's "meticulous research" in his Foreword to his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/08/garden/08TREE.html?ei=5007&amp;en=63e82ae43d2f66c6&amp;ex=1388898000&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= Mitchell Owens, "Surprises in the Family Tree"], ''The New York Times'', January 8, 2004, accessed July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the white women were free, their mixed-race children were born free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Nell Irvin Painter]] examined issues of power in ''Southern History Across the Color Line'' (2002). Joshua Rothman looked closely at antebellum Virginia and numerous mixed-race families in ''Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Families across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861'' (2003). In two books, the scholar [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] showed how historians had ignored evidence of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s and [[Sally Hemings]]' long affair and mixed-race children, who were seven-eighths white. In her deep research, however, she did not support claims that Jefferson was of mixed-race descent. [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy|DNA studies]] in 1998 showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of [[Eston Hemings]], leading experts to conclude that Jefferson was likely the father of Hemings' children.  The Thomas Jefferson Foundation agrees that the weight of historical evidence supports this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/reportstatement.html |title=Statement on the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings |author=Jordan, Daniel P. |publisher=Monticello Foundation |accessdate=2008-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608234107/http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/reportstatement.html |archivedate=2008-06-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unverified ===
None of the claims below have been verified by reliable sources in peer-reviewed publications. Mainline historians do not support these claims.

==== Thomas Jefferson ====
Vaughn and others claim [[early life and career of Thomas Jefferson#Jeffersons of Virginia|Thomas Jefferson]]'s mother [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] was of mixed-race ancestry.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussain"&gt;{{cite news |first=Aysha  |last=Hussain |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Obama Won't Be First Black President |url=http://northdallasgazette.com/archives/2009/01-15-09_edition.pdf |quote=Were there other "black" presidents? Some historians have reason to believe people don't really understand the genealogy of past U.S. Presidents. Research shows at least five U.S. presidents had black ancestors and Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president, was considered the first black president, according to historian Leroy Vaughn, author of ''Black People and Their Place in World History''. Vaughn's research shows Jefferson was not the only former black U.S. president. Who were the others? Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge. But why was this unknown? How were they elected president? All five of these presidents never acknowledged their black ancestry. |work=North Dallas Gazette (published from ''Diversity'' original from 2008) |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Gordon-Reed, ''The Hemingses of Monticello'' and ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Vaughn says, "The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called ''The Johnny Cake Papers''.  Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroy William Vaughn |coauthors= |title=Black People and Their Place in History |year=2002 |publisher=Lulu.com |quote= | url= |isbn=0-9715920-0-4 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century Presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of [[John Adams]] accused Jefferson of being "half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman"&lt;ref name="Nock-Jefferson-p141"&gt;[[Albert Jay Nock|Nock, Albert Jay]], ''Jefferson'' (N.Y.: Hill &amp; Wang (American Century ser.), 1st Am.

Vaughn also quoted biographer Samuel Sloan's statement that there was "something strange" about Thomas Jefferson's reportedly destroying papers and personal effects of his mother [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] after her death. That is the extent of his evidence.

The [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], which owns and operates [[Monticello]], the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: "His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |title=Brief Biography of Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) |accessdate=2009-01-31 |quote= |publisher=Monticello Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801045437/http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |archivedate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the quote in ''The Johnny Cake Papers'' as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 rather than the 1796 election campaign and clearly is one made by political opponents. ''The Johnny Cake Papers'' were a collection of folk tales published in 1879, not 1867, and only one tale commented on Jefferson.  The Foundation states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To date we have not found this quotation in any sources contemporary to the election of 1800. Its earliest known appearance in print is actually in a collection of New England folk tales, ''The Johnny-Cake Papers''. First published in 1879, the stories told date in many cases back to the beginning of the 19th century, while others are thought to be even older.  The reference in question appears in the "Seventeenth Baking," in which a "most veracious stump orator from Providence" spoke expansively on the achievements of [president] John Adams,

* "...the profound and fearless patriot and full-blooded Yankee, [who] exceeded in every possible respect his competitor, Tom Jefferson, for the Presidency, who, to make the best of him, was nothing but a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father, as was well known in the neighborhood where he was raised, wholly on hoe-cake (made of course-ground Southern corn), bacon, and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog, for which abominable reptiles he had acquired a taste during his residence among the French in Paris, to whom there could be no question he would sell his country at the first offer made to him cash down, should he be elected to fill the Presidential chair."

[[Dixon Wecter]], in his essay "Thomas Jefferson, The Gentle Radical," discusses various portrayals of Jefferson by his political enemies, and mentions that "the Jonnycake [sic] Papers later burlesqued such caricatures..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/%22Son_of_a_half-breed_Indian_squaw...%22 |title=Son of a half-breed Indian squaw... |accessdate=2009-01-31 |quote= |publisher=Monticello Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Providence, Rhode Island]], the capital and most populous city of the state}}{{Efn|[[Yankee]]s, people from the northeastern U.S. (the term is sometimes an insult)}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Warren G. Harding ====
[[Warren G. Harding#African-American lineage contention|Warren G. Harding]] was said to have African ancestry; one claim was by his political opponent, a controversial and racist historian, [[William Estabrook Chancellor]]. Chancellor said Harding's father was a [[mulatto]]&lt;ref name="chideya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gage"&gt;{{cite news |first= Beverly|last= Gage|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Our First Black President?  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/magazine/06wwln-essay-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-20 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210223839/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/magazine/06wwln-essay-t.html| archivedate=December 10, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mlynar" /&gt; and Harding's great-grandmother was black.&lt;ref name="Gage" /&gt; During Harding's campaign, Democratic opponents spread rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a [[West Indian]] [[black person|black]] and that other blacks might be found in his family tree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Russell (author)|Russell, Francis]], ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove–Warren G. Harding In His Times'' (Easton Press, 1962; {{ISBN|0-07-054338-0}}), p.&amp;nbsp;372.&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor publicized rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Francis, ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;403–405.&lt;/ref&gt; In an era when the "one-drop rule" would classify a person with any African ancestry as black, and black people in [[Southern United States|the South]] had been effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]], Harding's campaign manager responded, "no family in the state (of Ohio) has a clearer, a more honorable record than the Hardings', a blue-eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Francis, ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt; "Many biographers have dismissed the rumors of Harding's mixed-race family as little more than a political scandal and Chancellor himself as a Democratic mudslinger and racist ideologue."&lt;ref name="Gage" /&gt; According to Chancellor, Harding got his only academic degree from [[Ohio Central College|Iberia College]], which had been "founded to educate fugitive slaves."&lt;ref name="Hussain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, P.

PMD Press, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The college was founded by abolitionist supporters in the [[Presbyterian Church]] in [[Ohio]] for students of both genders and all races. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When asked directly about Chancellor's account, Harding did not make any effort to deny that he may have had an African-American ancestor. He said he did not know and demonstrated that it was not a significant issue.&lt;ref name="Gage"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman [[James W. Faulkner]] on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: "How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Samuel Hopkins, ''Incredible Era: The Life and Times of Warren Gamaliel Harding'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1939; {{ISBN|0-374-90051-5}}), p.&amp;nbsp;280.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while there are gaps in the historical record, studies of his family tree have not found evidence of an African-American ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cleveland.com/pdopinion/2008/02/warren_g_hardings_roots_and_ra.html Millner, Gloria, ''Warren G.

[[Calvin Coolidge]]'s mother Victoria Moor was claimed to be of a mixed-race family in [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name=chideya/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; Vaughn noted that her surname was derived from "Moor", a European term for people of [[North Africa]].

English: from Old French more 'Moor' (Latin maurus). The Latin term denoted a native of northwestern Africa, but in medieval England the word came to be used informally as a nickname for any swarthy or dark-skinned person. | url= |isbn= 0-19-508137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.

Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===

[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After they had navigated for nearly {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.
[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.

Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="817">A '''bailleur''', a French term, is a land owner who outsourced uncultivated parcels of land as part of an early [[Middle Age]] sharecropping system known as ''complant'' &amp;mdash; a precursor to the [[métayage]] system. Under this system, a laborer known as a [[prendeur]] would agree to cultivate land owned by the ''bailleur'' in exchange for ownership of the crop and its production. For use of the ''bailleur's'' soil, the ''prendeur'' promised a share (normally a third to two-thirds) of the crop's production or its revenue to the ''bailleur''. The length of this partnership varied and sometimes would extend over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Johnson, ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 116. Simon and Schuster 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burchell’s Shelter''' is a small rock overhang and archaeological site located in a kloof in the [[Ghaap Escarpment]] at [[Campbell, Northern Cape|Campbell]] in the [[Northern Cape, South Africa|Northern Cape]], [[South Africa]]. As an archaeological site it has a shallow deposit containing late [[Holocene]], mainly nineteenth century remains. Further interest in the shelter derives from the existence of an eyewitness description by the traveller William Burchell of the last Stone Age hunter-gatherers who inhabited the shelter. &lt;ref&gt;Burchell, W. J. 1822. ''Travels in the Interior of South Africa.'' 2nd ed. 1953. London: Batchworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it presented an opportunity, recognised by [[archaeologist]] [[Anthony Humphreys (archaeologist)|Anthony Humphreys]], to examine the occupation of the shelter from both an historical and an archaeological point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, A.J.B. 1975. Burchell's Shelter: The History and Archaeology of a Northern Cape Rock Shelter. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'', Vol. 30, No. 117/118 (Jun., 1975), pp. 3-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Strong springs near the head of the valley – at what would become the village of Campbell – had been noted by the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] polity based at [[Griquatown, Northern Cape|Klaarwater]] (Griquatown) in 1805, but it was not before 1811 that they occupied the place, then known as  ‘Knovel Valley'.&lt;ref&gt;Arnot, D. &amp; Orpen, F.H. 1875.''The Land Question of Griqualand West''. Cape Town: Saul. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the missionary the Revd [[Lambert Jansz]], in the company of the traveller [[William Burchell]], took possession of the fountains (springs) in the name of the [[London Missionary Society]].

During this visit Burchell met and described the inhabitants of the rock shelter in the kloof. As they were soon afterwards absorbed into the community settling at what became Campbell, Burchell's account is a description of people at the very end of the Stone Age hunter-gatherer phase in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, A.J.B. 1975. Burchell's Shelter: The History and Archaeology of a Northern Cape Rock Shelter. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'', Vol. 30, No. 117/118 (Jun., 1975), pp. 3-18&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

'''Canteen Kopje''' is an archaeological site, formally protected as a grade 2 provincial heritage site, and approved in 2017 for re-grading to national status, situated outside [[Barkly West]] in the [[Northern Cape]], South Africa. The place was previously known as Klipdrift, meaning stony drift, a translation from a still earlier !Ora name, !''a'' |''aub''. Canteen Kopje is best known for its long and exceptionally rich [[Early Stone Age|Earlier Stone Age]] sequence, spanning circa &gt;0.5 to 1.7 million years, occurring within gravels exposed in late nineteenth/early twentieth century mining pits. Also attracting attention are more recent archaeological levels in the overlying Hutton Sands, which contain material known as Fauresmith, Middle Stone Age, Later Stone Age, and late Iron Age with evidence of protocolonial/colonial contact and interaction, probably, with nineteenth century diamond diggers. 
 
The importance of Canteen Kopje as a heritage site was recognized, and a 9 hectare area known as Erf 91 was proclaimed as a protected reserve in 1948. Gideon Retief, Mining Commissioner of Barkly West from 1942 to 1951, was instrumental in preserving the site and creating the first open air exhibit here. Subsequently, in 2000, information panels were erected by the McGregor Museum. These were refurbished in 2016. A walking trail was laid out for visitors to view the early diamond diggings and archaeological research sites. The [[Barkly West Museum]] contains further information and examples of artefacts from the site, while material excavated by archaeologists is housed principally by the [[McGregor Museum]], the approved archaeological repository for the Northern Cape Province in nearby Kimberley.

In 2016 the protected heritage site was directly threatened after the Department of Minerals and Energy issued a permit for part of the site to be mined. Although a heritage permit had not been issued by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]], mining commenced on 18 March 2016. An urgent interdicted was granted by the Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa on 19 March, being made final on 19 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canteenkopje.com/ Canteen Kopje - Cultural Heritage under Threat]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the archaeologist [[Clarence Van Riet Lowe|C. van Riet Lowe]] predicted: “When the last diamond claim has been abandoned, archaeologists throughout the world will be interested in Canteen Kopje, in the Vaal River diggings, where lie the prehistoric remains of a million years of human evolution.”

==Alluvial diamond diggings==
One of the hills in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje was the site of the first [[alluvial]] diamond diggings (as opposed to surface prospecting) on the [[Diamond Fields]] of South Africa, which precipitated the rush to these parts in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Digging continued here until the early 1940s.

[[Tswana people|Batlhaping]] ''Kgosi'' (Chief) [[Jantjie Mothibi]] controlled, for as long as he could, the influx of white “diamond seekers” to the region. Prospectors were allowed to use sharp sticks, but were not permitted to “touch the ground with pick and shovel”. For their part, as noted by Jerome Babe in his 1872 book, ''The South African Diamond Fields'', “Natives would form themselves in long lines, joined hand in hand, and walk slowly over the ground and look for diamonds, especially after rain; and if they found one they would take it to a trader...[Finds were exchanged for] horses, wagons, cows, sheep, cash, goods, etc at a deuce of a pace”.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1870 diggers from KwaZulu-Natal were working their way along the [[Vaal River]], finding diamonds at Klipdrift, on the “Old Koppie”, upslope from Canteen Kopje. Using “pick and shovel, in spite of the natives”, they unearthed more, precipitating the diamond rush. Soon both banks of the Vaal River were thronging with diggers of many nationalities, and by the end of the year there were five thousand people at Klipdrift alone.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diggers formed a Mutual Protection Association and elected [[Stafford Parker]] as their leader. Klipdrift was renamed Parkerton (from 1873 it was called Barkly West), and a Diggers’ Republic was proclaimed in July 1870.

A popular early cradle sieve for recovery of diamonds was the so-called “Long Tom”, which was reliant on large quantities of water. An improved version less dependent on water was developed by the American digger, author of ''The South African Diamond Fields'', Jerome Babe. His ‘dry sifter’, known as the “Yankee Baby”, is still used in the twenty first century by some small-scale diggers. At the time, its inventor was said to be “the first Babe to rock his own cradle”.

The centrifugal or rotary washing machine – now standard on diggings in the area – is more sophisticated. In a slurry, a concentrate of heavy diamond-bearing deposit is separated from lighter waste.

Diggers staked their claims near the river, and dug the gravel where it was exposed at or near the surface. Where the gravel was buried deeper under silt and sand - such as at Canteen Kopje - large pits were dug. From these and from vertical shafts, the diggers tunnelled out precarious passageways in which a man could hardly stand.

==Geology==
The sequence of geological deposits in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje comprises:

*Resistant 2 800 million year old andesitic lavas of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, underlying the entire area.
*Thin patches of circa 280 million year old basal Karoo Sequence sediments made up of tillite and shale locally.
*Shallow remnants of 19-17 million year old Older Gravels on the tops and upper slopes of adjacent hills.
*Up to circa 10m thickness of &gt;0.5 to 1.7 million year old Younger Gravels formed largely from rock debris washed from adjacent hillsides.
*Up to 4m thick reddish windblown Hutton Sands that accumulated during drier intervals since about 0.3-0.5 million years ago.

Diamonds at or near Canteen Kopje are confined to the Older and Younger Gravels. Around 90-120 million years ago, a swarm of volcanic pipes, centred on Kimberley to the east, brought  diamond-bearing kimberlite to a higher surface formed of Karoo Sequence sediments. Subsequent erosion has lowered the entire regional landscape by over 1200 metres and in the process the diamonds were released from their host rock. It has been estimated that at least 50 million carats of diamonds were set free in this way from the five kimberlite pipes in the vicinity of Kimberley alone. Most of those were flushed away to the sea long ago in past and present river channels, but along the way some were trapped in alluvial deposits such as the Older and Younger Gravels along rivers in this region.

==Recognition of archaeological significance==
[[File:Canteen Kopje-2.JPG|thumb|general view of Canteen Kopje site from the nearby hill]]
Earlier Stone Age artefacts were noted in the area by Colonel [[James Henry Bowker]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Barber]] at the time of the earliest diamond diggings. Eminent prehistorians including [[Clarence Van Riet Lowe|C. van Riet Lowe]], the French prehistorian, the Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] and [[J. Desmond Clark]] visited and described it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Young | first2 = R.B. | year = 1906 | title = The relation of ancient deposits of the Vaal River to the palaeolithic period of South Africa | url = | journal = Transactions of the Geological Society of South Africa | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 53–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Péringuey | first1 = Louis | authorlink = Louis Péringuey | year = 1911 | title = The stone ages of South Africa as represented in the collections of the South African Museum | url = | journal = Annals of the South African Museum | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 1–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = J.H. | year = 1949 | title = The contribution of the northern Cape to the study of prehistoric man | url = | journal = South African Journal of Science | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 107–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Söhnge | first1 = P.G. | last2 = Visser | first2 = D.J.L. | last3 = van Riet Lowe | first3 = C. | year = 1937 | title = The geology and archaeology of the Vaal River basin | url = | journal = Geological Survey of South Africa Memoir | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breuil was here in 1929 and again in the 1940s, when he famously noted that "not only are there enough specimens [there] to fill a museum to overflowing but to build it of them also."

==Preserved and almost lost==
On account both of the mining history as well as the finding of Acheulean artefacts at this spot, a 10 morgen portion of Canteen Kopje was declared a National Monument (since 2000 known as a [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage site]]) in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholster, J.J. 1972. ''The historical monuments of South Africa''. Stellenbosch: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation for Culture for the National Monuments Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Mining recommenced in the vicinity in the 1990s and Canteen Kopje was nearly lost. Pressure was exerted for the site to be de-proclaimed as a heritage site, to allow for renewed diamond digging and ‘empowerment’ of small scale miners.  The local community recognised the value of conserving heritage and supported the efforts of the then National Monuments Council and the [[McGregor Museum]] to preserve the site, which was then developed as an open-air museum. The new [[Barkly West Museum]] was created at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turkington | first1 = T. | year = 2000 | title = Realising a dream: Canteen Kopje and the new Barkly West Museum | url = | journal = The Digging Stick | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed threat was experienced in 2016. In 2014 the [[Department of Mineral Resources (South Africa)|Department of Minerals]] (DMR) issued a permit for mining to take place on part of the declared site. The [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] (SAHRA) was alerted and in response, because of the existing formal declaration, a Cease Works Order was put in place to prevent mining from taking place. Pressure was exerted however and in March 2016 the Cease Works Order was lifted, following which, on 16 March 2016, a diamond mining operation commenced work by fencing off an area around that for which they have a DMR mining permit. Public access to the remainder of the heritage site was blocked. Section 27(18) of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) (Act 25 of 1999) states that: "No person may destroy, damage, deface, excavate, alter, remove from its original position, subdivide or change the planning status of any heritage site without a permit issued by the heritage resources authority responsible for the protection of such site." Section 51. (1) of the NHRA states that: "Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person who contravenes— (a) sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) or 32(19) is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment as set out in item 1 of the Schedule." Since the mining concern has commenced mining operations without such a permit issued by SAHRA, it is clearly in contravention of an Act of the Republic of South Africa and therefore is guilty of an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anetos|first1=Pericles|title=Diamond company mines illegally in heritage site rich in early stone age artefacts|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/scitech/2016/03/19/Diamond-company-mines-illegally-in-heritage-site-rich-in-early-stone-age-artefacts|accessdate=19 March 2016|agency=Time Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Outrage over mining at world heritage site|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/northern-cape/outrage-over-mining-at-world-heritage-site-2000275|website=IOL|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilian|first1=Anine|title=Local scientists dismayed at mining operations at heritage site.|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/local-scientists-dismayed-at-mining-operations-at-heritage-site-2016-03-18|website=Mining Weekly|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leader|first1=George M.|title=World Heritage Gone: South African Diamond Mining Destroys Archaeological Sites Daily|url=https://leakeyfoundation.org/world-heritage-gone-south-african-diamond-mining-destroys-archaeological-sites-daily/|website=The Leakey Foundation|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological and geological investigations from the 1990s==
Excavations in the late 1990s were carried out by [[Peter Beaumont (archaeologist)|Peter Beaumont]] of the McGregor Museum. [[John McNabb]] from the [[University of Southampton]] worked with Beaumont in analysing the [[Acheulean]] stone artefact technology.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, P.B. 1990. Canteen Koppie (Klipdrift). In Beaumont, P. &amp;  Morris, D. (eds.) ''Guide to Archaeological sites in the Northern Cape''. 14–16. McGregor Museum: Kimberley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, P. &amp; McNabb, J. (2000a.) Report for the National Monuments Council of South Africa on excavations by Peter Beaumont at Canteen Koppie, Barkly West, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Unpublished report, with supplement by Peter Beaumont&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beaumont | first1 = P. | last2 = McNabb | first2 = J. | year = 2000b | title = Canteen Kopje: the recent excavations | url = | journal = The Digging Stick | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNabb, J. (2001) The shape of things to come: a speculative essay on the role of the Victoria West phenomenon at Canteen Koppie during the South African Earlier Stone Age. In Milligen, S. &amp; Cook, J. (eds) ''"A very remote period indeed": papers on the Palaeolithic presented to Derek Roe''. Oxford: Oxbow Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations have been carried out by archaeologists from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (inter alia for application of [[cosmogenic nuclide burial dating]]) and the University of Toronto. The current active programme of research has yielded an as yet unpublished basal date of some 2.3 million years, while excavations involving students from the Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley investigate the most recent circa 19th century contact period archaeology showing interaction between local communities and colonial diggers.

Crucial to the interpretation of the archaeology of the site, is an understanding of site formation in relation to the adjacent hill and the [[Vaal River]] which at different periods cut down first to the north of the site and then the south west.&lt;ref&gt;Helgren, D.M. (1979) ''River of diamonds: an alluvial history of the lower Vaal basin, South Africa''. Chicago: University of Chicago. Department of Geography. Research Paper 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Wit, M.C.J., Ward, J.D. &amp; Jacob, J.R. (1997) Diamond-bearing deposits of the Vaal-Orange River System. ''Field Excursion Guidebook 6th International Conference on Fluvial Sedimentology'', University of Cape Town, September 1997 2, 1–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2113/gssajg.111.1.53 | last1 = De Wit | first1 = M.C.J. | year = 2008 | title = Canteen Koppie at Barkly West: South Africa's first diamond mine | url = | journal = [[South African Journal of Geology]] | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 53–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/1/53 Canteen Koppie at Barkly West: South Africa’s first diamond mine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007-9 a 7-metre sequence through Hutton Sands and Gravels was excavated to carry out dating and a detailed analysis of the lithic profile. There is a marked 'Victoria West' Acheulean horizon (named for the [[Victoria West|town in the Karoo]] where these stone tools were first described) in the upper part of the gravels, subject to a current Southampton PhD project. The lower part of the sequence contains simpler, older Acheulean technology.

Later Stone Age material at and just below the surface has been studied in two excavations by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand and Toronto.

==Canteen Kopje Skull==
The [[Canteen Kopje Skull]] was found in the vicinity in 1925 by diamond digger Kenneth Kemp, working 2.4 m down at an unrecorded locality at Canteen Kopje. A number of fitting skull fragments were presented by Kemp to the magistrate J.G. van Alphen, who in turn donated them to the McGregor Museum. They were studied soon afterwards by [[Robert Broom]], who described it in ''Nature'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broom | first1 = R. | year = 1929 | title = Australoid elements in the Korannas | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 124 | issue = 3127| page = 507 | bibcode=1929Natur.124..507B | doi = 10.1038/124507a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = L.H. | year = 1948 | title = The Canteen Koppie skull | url = | journal = South African Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 156–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Broom’s reconstruction, the skull appeared to have features similar to an allegedly archaic skeleton found at Boskop near Johannesburg. In 2011-12 X-ray Computerised Tomography scans of the skull, carried out at the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation near Pretoria, suggested it falls within the range of variation of Khoe-San populations of the Holocene (last 12 000 years), and is not ‘archaic’ as Broom had suggested. Reconsideration of the evidence also points to it having come from the Hutton Sands and not the Younger Gravels, as previously presumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Patricia|last2=Nshimirimana|first2=Robert|last3=de Beer|first3=Frikkie|last4=Morris|first4=David|last5=Jacobson|first5=Leon|last6=Chazan|first6=Michael|last7=Horwitz|first7=Liora K.|title=Canteen Kopje: a new look at an old skull|journal=South African Journal of Science|date=Jan 2012|volume=108|issue=1-2|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0038-23532012000100017&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demilitarisation''' or '''demilitarization''' may mean the reduction of state armed forces. For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Loyalism in Northern Ireland|last=Spencer|first=Graham|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=9781349542246|location=New York|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from [[demobilization]], which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army. 

== Definitions ==
Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the [[aftermath of World War I]], the [[United Kingdom]] greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as [[disarmament]]. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lloyd George and the Appeasement of Germany, 1919-1945|last=Rudman|first=Stella|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443826570|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian [[Polizia di Stato]] demilitarised in 1981, and the [[Austrian Gendarmerie]] merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Haller"&gt;Haller, Oliver, ''[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2007/0126/pdf/doh.pdf Destroying Weapons of Coal, Air and Water: A Critical Evaluation of the American Policy of German Industrial Demilitarization 1945 - 1952]'' (Philipps-Universität Marburg: Marburg, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the [[Cold War]] began.

Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems ''(See [[Arms Control]])'' or the removal of combat equipment from a [[warship]] ''(See [[Japanese battleship Hiei]])''.

A [[demilitarised zone]] is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to International Humanitarian Law|last=Djukić|first=Dražan|last2=Pons|first2=Niccolò|publisher=BRILL Nijhoff|year=2018|isbn=9789004342002|location=Leiden|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Customary International Humanitarian Law|last=Henckaerts|first=Jean-Marie|last2=Doswald-Beck|first2=Louise|last3=Alvermann|first3=Carolin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521839372|location=Cambridge|pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, however, of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]], of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized.

Examples of demilitarisation include:

* The [[Treaty of Versailles]] barred post–World War I Germany from having an air force, armoured vehicles, and certain types of naval vessels. In addition, it established a demilitarised zone in the [[Rhineland]].
* The massive reductions of military personnel in the Allied countries, following World War I.
** The [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II]]
* The [[Washington Naval Treaty]]
* The [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43637">{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Dialectical materialism''' is a [[philosophy]] of [[science]] and [[nature]] developed in Europe and based on the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. A. Jordan, ''The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism'' (London: Macmillan, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thomas, ''Marxism and Scientific Socialism: From Engels to Althusser'' (London: Routledge, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialectical materialism adapts the [[Hegelian dialectic]] for traditional [[materialism]], which examines the subjects of the world in relation to each other within a dynamic, evolutionary environment, in contrast to metaphysical materialism, which examines parts of the world within a static, isolated environment.

Dialectical materialism accepts the evolution of the natural world and the emergence of new qualities of being at new stages of evolution. As Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."&lt;ref name="Jordan, p. 167"&gt;Jordan, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and [[historical materialism]] (such as in Stalin's book ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'') in the 1930s by [[Joseph Stalin]] and his associates, became the "official" Soviet interpretation of [[Marxism]]. It was codified and popularized in textbooks which were{{when|date=January 2017}} required reading in the Soviet Union as well as in some Eastern European countries. It was exported to China as the "official" interpretation of Marxism.

== The term ==
Marx and Engels never used the words "dialectical materialism" in their own writings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch02.htm|title=Marx's Conception of Man |author= [[Erich Fromm]] |publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1887 by [[Joseph Dietzgen]], a socialist who corresponded with Marx, during and after the failed [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Charbonnat, ''Histoire des philosophies matérialistes'', Syllepse, 2007, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Casual mention of the term "dialectical materialism" is also found in the biography ''Frederick Engels'', by philosopher [[Karl Kautsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1887/xx/engels.htm |title=Karl Kautsky: Frederick Engels (1887) |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2003-11-23 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the same year. Marx himself had talked about the "materialist conception of history", which was later referred to as "[[historical materialism]]" by Engels. Engels further explained the "materialist dialectic" in his ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' in 1883. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], the father of Russian Marxism, later introduced the term "dialectical materialism" to Marxist literature.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Plekhanov, ''The development of the monist view of history'' (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] further delineated and defined dialectical and historical materialism as the world outlook of [[Marxism-Leninism]], and as a method to study society and its history.&lt;ref&gt;as discussed in his 1938 article, Dialectical and Historical Materialism [http://marx2mao.net/Stalin/DHM38.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Marx and Engels each began their adulthood as [[Young Hegelians]], one of several groups of intellectuals inspired by the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sperber |first=Jonathan |year=2013 |title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |year=2009 |title=Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/marxs-general-the-revolutionary-life-of-friedrich-engels/oclc/263983621 |publisher=Metropolitan/Henry Holt &amp; Co |postscript=.|isbn=9780805080254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',  was concerned with the [[atomism]] of [[Epicurus]] and [[Democritus]], which is considered the foundation of materialist philosophy. Marx was also familiar with [[Lucretius]]'s theory of ''[[clinamen]]''. Marx and Engels both concluded that Hegelian philosophy, at least as interpreted by their former colleagues, was too abstract and was being misapplied in attempts to explain the [[social injustice]] in [[industrialisation|recently industrializing]] countries such as [[Germany]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]], which was a growing concern in the early 1840s.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt;

In contrast to the conventional [[dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]] of the day, which emphasized the [[idealism|idealist]] observation that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions, Marx developed [[dialectic#Marxist dialectics|Marxist dialectics]], which emphasized the [[materialism|materialist]] view that the world of the concrete shapes [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interactions and that those in turn determine [[political sociology|sociopolitical]] reality.&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"/&gt; Whereas some Hegelians blamed religious alienation (estrangement from the traditional comforts of religion) for societal ills, Marx and Engels concluded that alienation from economic and political [[autonomy]], coupled with [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[poverty]], was the real culprit.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt; In keeping with dialectical ideas, Marx and Engels thus created an alternative theory, not only of why the world is the way it is but also of which actions people should take to make it the way it ought to be. In ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), Marx wrote, "The philosophers have only ''interpreted'' the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to ''change'' it."&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"/&gt; Dialectical materialism is thus closely related to Marx's and Engels's [[historical materialism]] (and has sometimes been viewed as [[synonym]]ous with it). Marx rejected the language of "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]".&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

Dialectical materialism is an aspect of the broader subject of [[materialism]], which asserts the primacy of the material world: in short, matter precedes thought. Materialism is a [[Scientific realism|realist philosophy of science]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar 1979&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that the world is material; that all phenomena in the universe consist of "matter in motion," wherein all things are interdependent and interconnected and develop according to [[natural law]]; that the world exists outside us and independently of our perception of it; that thought is a reflection of the material world in the brain, and that the world is ''in principle'' knowable. Marx criticized classical materialism as another idealist philosophy—idealist because of its transhistorical understanding of material contexts. The Young Hegelian [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] had rejected Hegel's idealistic philosophy and advocated materialism.&lt;ref name="Marxists"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/e.htm "Feuerbach, Ludwig"] at marxists.org. Accessed 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being strongly influenced by Feuerbach,&lt;ref name="Marxists"/&gt; Marx rejected Feuerbach's version of materialism as inconsistent.&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Engels, especially ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1878) and ''Dialectics of Nature'' (1875–82), were the source of the main doctrines of dialectical materialism.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

== Marx's dialectics&lt;!--'Dialectical idealism' redirects here--&gt; ==
The concept of dialectical materialism emerges from statements by Marx in the second edition postface to his magnum opus, [[Das Kapital|''Capital'']]. There Marx says he intends to use Hegelian dialectics but in revised form. He defends Hegel against those who view him as a "dead dog" and then says, "I openly avowed myself as the pupil of that mighty thinker [[Hegel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy'', ed. Frederick Engels (New York: Modern Library, no date, first published 1906), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx credits Hegel with "being the first to present [dialectic's] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner". But he then criticizes Hegel for turning dialectics upside down: "With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell."&lt;ref name="Marx, p. 25"&gt;Marx, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's criticism of Hegel asserts that Hegel's dialectics go astray by dealing with ideas, with the human mind. Hegel's dialectic, Marx says, inappropriately concerns "the process of the human brain"; it focuses on ideas.  Hegel's thought is in fact sometimes called '''dialectical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, and Hegel himself is counted among a number of other philosophers known as the [[German idealists]].  Marx, on the contrary, believed that dialectics should deal not with the mental world of ideas but with "the material world", the world of production and other economic activity.&lt;ref name="Marx, p. 25"/&gt;

For Marx, human history cannot be fitted into any neat ''a priori'' schema. He explicitly rejects the idea of Hegel's followers that history can be understood as "a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which real human individuals are but the bearers".&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx and F. Engels, ''The Holy Family'' (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1956), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; To interpret history as though previous social formations have somehow been aiming themselves toward the present state of affairs is "to misunderstand the historical movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired by the generations that preceded them".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' (London: Martin Lawrence, [1936]), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's rejection of this sort of [[teleology]] was one reason for his enthusiastic (though not entirely uncritical) reception of Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Taylor, "The Significance of Darwinian Theory for Marx and Engels", ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences'' 19 (1989), 409–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, dialectics is not a formula for generating predetermined outcomes but is a method for the empirical study of social processes in terms of interrelations, development, and transformation. In his introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's ''Capital'', [[Ernest Mandel]] writes, "When the dialectical method is applied to the study of economic problems, economic phenomena are not viewed separately from each other, by bits and pieces, but in their inner connection as an integrated totality, structured around, and by, a basic predominant mode of production."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, Introduction to Karl Marx, ''Capital'', Vol. 1 (Harmondsworth, U.K.: Penguin, 1976), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's own writings are almost exclusively concerned with understanding human history in terms of systemic processes, based on [[modes of production]] (broadly speaking, the ways in which societies are organized to employ their technological powers to interact with their material surroundings). This is called ''[[historical materialism]]''. More narrowly, within the framework of this general theory of history, most of Marx's writing is devoted to an analysis of the specific structure and development of the capitalist economy.

For his part, Engels applies a "dialectical" approach to the natural world in general, arguing that contemporary science is increasingly recognizing the necessity of viewing natural processes in terms of interconnectedness, development, and transformation. Some scholars have doubted that Engels's "dialectics of nature" is a legitimate extension of Marx's approach to social processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schmidt, ''The Concept of Nature in Marx'' (London: NLB, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thomas, "Marx and Science", ''Political Studies'' 24 (1976), 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Carver, ''Engels: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued that despite Marx's insistence that humans are natural beings in an evolving, mutual relationship with the rest of nature, Marx's own writings pay inadequate attention to the ways in which human agency is constrained by such factors as biology, geography, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastiano Timpanaro, ''On Materialism'' (London: NLB, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ted Benton, ed., ''The Greening of Marxism'' (New York: Guilford Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engels's dialectics&lt;!--'Materialist dialectic' redirects here--&gt; ==
Engels postulated three laws of dialectics from his reading of Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, F. (7th ed., 1973). ''Dialectics of nature'' (Translator, Clements Dutt). New York: International Publishers. (Original work published 1940). See also ''[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/index.htm Dialectics of Nature]''&lt;/ref&gt; Engels elucidated these laws as the '''materialist dialectic'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in his work ''Dialectics of Nature'':

# The law of the unity and conflict of opposites
# The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes
# The law of the negation of the negation

The first law, which originates with the ancient [[Ionians|Ionian]] philosopher [[Heraclitus]],&lt;ref&gt;cf. for instance. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/heraclit.htm#H3 'The Doctrine of Flux and the Unity of Opposites' in the 'Heraclitus' entry in the ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; was seen by both Hegel and [[Vladimir Lenin]] as the central feature of a dialectical understanding of things:
{{quote|It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of oppositions in their unity, or of the positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists. It is the most important aspect of dialectic.|Hegel, ''Science of Logic'', § 69, (p 56 in the Miller edition)}}
{{quote|The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence (one of the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how Hegel, too, puts the matter.|Lenin's Collected Works VOLUME 38, p359: On the question of dialectics.}}

The second law Hegel took from Ancient Greek philosophers, notably the [[paradox of the heap]], and explanation by Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;"The sudden conversion into a change of quality of a change which was apparently merely quantitative had already attracted the attention of the ancients who illustrated in popular examples the contradiction arising from ignorance of this fact; they are familiar under the names of 'the bald' and 'the heap'. These elenchi are, according to Aristotle's explanation, the ways in which one is compelled to say the opposite of what one had previously asserted..." https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl333.htm#0719. Hegel, ''Science of Logic'', § 718ff, (p 335 in the Miller edition. See also pp. 368–70.)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is equated with what scientists call [[phase transitions]]. It may be traced to the ancient Ionian philosophers, particularly [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]&lt;ref&gt;c.f. a fascination with transitions between [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]]. Guthrie, W.K.C. "The Milesians: Anaximenes". ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; from whom Aristotle, Hegel, and Engels inherited the concept. For all these authors, one of the main illustrations is the [[phase transitions]] of water. There has also been an effort to apply this mechanism to social phenomena, whereby population increases result in changes in social structure. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes can also be applied to the process of social change and class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R.L. (2000). The transition from quantity to quality: A neglected causal mechanism in accounting for social evolution. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences''. Vol. 97, No. 23, pp. 12926–12931. [http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12926.full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third law, "negation of the negation", originated with Hegel. Although Hegel coined the term "negation of the negation", it gained its fame from Marx's using it in ''Capital''.  There Marx wrote this: "The [death] knell of capitalist private property sounds.  The expropriators [capitalists] are expropriated.  The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property.  This is the first negation [antithesis] of individual private property.  [The "first negation", or antithesis, negates the thesis, which in this instance is feudalism, the economic system that preceded capitalism.] ... But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It [final communism, the synthesis] is the negation of [the] negation."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Capital'', ch. 32,  837.&lt;/ref&gt;

Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."&lt;ref name="Jordan, p. 167"/&gt;

== Lenin's contributions ==
{{Marxism-Leninism|concepts}}
After reading Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' in 1914, [[Lenin]] made some brief notes outlining three "elements" of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm |title=Lenin's Summary of Hegel's Dialectics (Lenin's Collected Works Vol. 38, pp. 221–222) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

# The determination of the concept out of itself [the thing itself must be considered in its relations and in its development];
# The contradictory nature of the thing itself (the other of itself), the contradictory forces and tendencies in each phenomenon;
# The union of analysis and synthesis.

Lenin develops these in a further series of notes, and appears to argue that "the transition of quantity into quality and vice versa" is an example of the unity and opposition of opposites expressed tentatively as "not only the unity of opposites but the transitions of every determination, quality, feature, side, property into every other [into its opposite?]."

Also, in his essay "On the Question of Dialectics", Lenin stated that "Development is the 'struggle' of opposites."
He stated that "The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm|title=On the Question of Dialectics|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Materialism and Empiriocriticism]]'' (1908), Lenin explained ''dialectical materialism'' as three axes: (i) the materialist inversion of Hegelian dialectics, (ii) the [[historicity (philosophy)|historicity]] of ethical principles ordered to [[class struggle]], and (iii) the convergence of "[[evolution|laws of evolution]]" in physics ([[Helmholtz]]), biology ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]), and in [[political economy]] (Marx). Hence, Lenin was philosophically positioned between historicist Marxism ([[Antonio Labriola|Labriola]]) and [[determinism|determinist]] Marxism—a political position close to "[[social Darwinism]]" (Kautsky). Moreover, late-century discoveries in physics ([[x-rays]], [[electrons]]), and the beginning of [[quantum mechanics]], philosophically challenged previous conceptions of [[matter]] and [[materialism]], thus matter seemed to be disappearing. Lenin disagreed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Matter disappears' means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter disappears, and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are disappearing that formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary, and which are now revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the ''sole'' 'property' of matter, with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up, is the property of ''being an objective reality'', of existing outside of the mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lenin was developing the work of Engels, who said that "with each epoch-making discovery, even in the sphere of [[natural science]], [[materialism]] has to change its form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.htm |title=Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Lenin's challenges was distancing materialism, as a viable philosophical outlook, from the "vulgar materialism" expressed in the statement "the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile" (attributed to 18th-century physician [[Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis]]); "metaphysical materialism" (matter composed of immutable particles); and 19th-century "mechanical materialism" (matter as random molecules interacting per the laws of mechanics). The philosophic solution that Lenin (and Engels) proposed was "dialectical materialism", wherein matter is defined as ''objective reality'', theoretically consistent with (new) developments occurring in the sciences.

Lenin reassessed [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s philosophy and concluded that it was in line with dialectical materialism.&lt;ref name="NC57" /&gt;

== Lukács's contributions ==
[[György Lukács]], Minister of Culture in the brief [[Béla Kun]] government of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (1919), published ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), in which he defined ''dialectical materialism'' as the knowledge of society as a whole, knowledge which, in itself, was the [[class consciousness]] of the proletariat. In the first chapter "What is Orthodox Marxism?", Lukács defined ''orthodoxy'' as fidelity to the "Marxist method", not fidelity to "dogmas":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the "belief" in this or that thesis, nor the [[exegesis]] of a "sacred" book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded, and deepened, only along the lines laid down by its founders. (§1)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his later works and actions, Lukács became a leader of [[Democratic Marxism]]. He modified many of his formulations of his 1923 works and went on to develop a Marxist ontology and played an active role in democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and the 1960s. He and his associates became sharply critical of the formulation of dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union that was exported to those countries under its control. In the 1960s, his associates became known as the [[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]].

Lukács philosophical criticism of [[Marxist revisionism]] proposed an intellectual return to the Marxist method. As did [[Louis Althusser]], who later defined Marxism and [[psychoanalysis]] as "conflictual sciences";&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Althusser]], "Marx and Freud", in ''Writings on Psychoanalysis'', Stock/IMEC, 1993 (French edition)&lt;/ref&gt; that political factions and revisionism are inherent to [[Marxist theory]] and political praxis, because dialectical materialism is the philosophic product of [[class struggle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For this reason, the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and [[utopian socialism|utopianism]] can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed struggle against the insidious effects of bourgeois ideology on the thought of the proletariat. Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical process. (§5)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness'.... Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity. (§5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the [[individualist]], [[bourgeois]] philosophy of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], which is founded upon the voluntary and [[consciousness|conscious subject]]. Against said [[ideology]] is the primacy of social relations. Existence—and thus the world—is the product of human activity, but this can be seen only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness is an effect of ideological mystification.

At the 5th Congress of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] (July 1924), [[Grigory Zinoviev]] formally denounced Lukács's heterodox definition of ''orthodox Marxism'' as exclusively derived from fidelity to the "Marxist method", and not to Communist party dogmas; and denounced the Marxism developments of the German theorist [[Karl Korsch]].

==Stalin's contributions==
In the 1930s, [[Joseph Stalin]] and his associates formulated a version of dialectical and [[historical materialism]] that became the "official" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified in Stalin's work, ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'' (1938), and popularized in textbooks used for [[compulsory education]] within the Soviet Union and throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]. It was exported to [[China]] as the "official" interpretation of Marxism but, in its Soviet formulation, has since then been widely rejected there.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Mao's contributions ==
In ''[[On Contradiction]]'' (1937), Mao outlined a version of dialectical materialism that subsumed two of Engels's three principal laws of dialectics, "the transformation of quantity into quality" and "the negation of the negation" as sub-laws (and not principal laws of their own) of the first law, "the unity and interpenetration of opposites".

== As a heuristic in biology and elsewhere ==
Historian of science [[Loren Graham]] has detailed at length the role played by dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union in disciplines as diverse as biology, psychology, chemistry, cybernetics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. He has concluded that, despite the [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] period in genetics and constraints on free inquiry imposed by political authorities, dialectical materialism had a positive influence on the work of many Soviet scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Graham, ''Science, Philosophy, and Human Behavior in the Soviet Union'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutionary biologists, such as [[Richard Lewontin]] and the late [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have tried to employ dialectical materialism in their approach. They view dialectics as playing a precautionary heuristic role in their work. From Lewontin's perspective, we get this idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us, "Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost when phenomena are isolated". And above all else, "Remember that all the other caveats are only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real world is contingent."&lt;ref name="evolutionthe1st4billionyears"&gt;{{cite book |title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| author=Beatty, J. | chapter=Lewontin, Richard | editors=Michael Ruse &amp; Joseph Travis | year=2009 | publisher= The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03175-3 | page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gould shared similar views regarding a heuristic role for dialectical materialism. He wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western scholars, not discarded because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine.&lt;ref name="Urchininthestorm153"&gt;{{cite book | title=An Urchin in the Storm: Essays About Books and Ideas |author=Gould, Stephen Jay | chapter=Nurturing Nature | editor=… | year=1990 | publisher=Penguin| location = London | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;...when presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as dogmatic precepts true by fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics embody a holistic vision that views change as interaction among components of complete systems and sees the components themselves not as a priori entities, but as both products and inputs to the system. Thus, the law of "interpenetrating opposites" records the inextricable interdependence of components: the "transformation of quantity to quality" defends a systems-based view of change that translates incremental inputs into alterations of state, and the "negation of negation" describes the direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert exactly to previous states.&lt;ref name="Urchininthestorm154"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1990), p.154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This heuristic was also applied to the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] proposed by Gould and [[Niles Eldredge]]. They wrote that "history, as Hegel said, moves upward in a spiral of negations", and that "punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time."&lt;ref name="Gould&amp;Eldredge"&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, &amp; Eldredge, Niles (1977). [http://www.nileseldredge.com/pdf_files/Punctuated_Equilibria_Gould_Eldredge_1977.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered."] ''Paleobiology'' '''3''' (2): 115–151. (p.145)&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that "the law of transformation of quantity into quality", "holds that a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of quantitative changes, long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it rapidly from one state into another", a phenomenon described in some disciplines as a [[paradigm shift]]. Apart from the commonly cited example of water turning to steam with increased temperature, Gould and Eldredge noted another analogy in [[information theory]], "with its jargon of equilibrium, steady state, and homeostasis maintained by [[negative feedback]]", and "extremely rapid transitions that occur with [[positive feedback]]".&lt;ref name="Gould&amp;Eldredge146"&gt;Gould, S. J., &amp; Eldredge, N. (1977) p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewontin, Gould, and Eldredge were thus more interested in dialectical materialism as a heuristic than a dogmatic form of 'truth' or a statement of their politics. Nevertheless, they found a readiness for critics to "seize upon" key statements&lt;ref name="Brockman"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Third Culture | author=Gould, S. J. | chapter=Stephen Jay Gould: "The Pattern of Life's History" | editor=Brockman, J. | year=1995 | publisher= Simon and Schuster | location = New York|isbn=978-0-684-80359-3 | page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portray punctuated equilibrium, and exercises associated with it, such as public exhibitions, as a "Marxist plot".&lt;ref name="Gould2002"&gt;{{cite book | last= Gould| first= Stephen Jay| title= The Structure of Evolutionary Theory | year = 2002 | publisher = The Belknap Press of Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn =978-0-674-00613-3 }} In his account of one ad hominem absurdity, Gould states on p. 984 "I swear that I do not exaggerate" regarding the accusations of a Marxist plot.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical evaluations==
Some critics argue against dialectical materialism on account of its adherence to a purely [[Materialism#Criticism and alternatives|materialist]] worldview, while others have objections to the [[Dialectic#Criticisms|dialectic]] method it employs. There are critics, such as the Marxist [[Alain Badiou]], who dispute the way the concept is interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing|last = Zizek|first = Slavoj|publisher = Verso|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844678976|location = New York}}p.44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Needham]], an influential historian of science and a Christian who nonetheless was an adherent of dialectical materialism, suggested that a more appropriate term might be "dialectical organicism".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, ''Moulds of Understanding'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1976), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leszek Kołakowski]], writing in ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1976), argued that dialectical materialism consists partly of "truisms with no specific Marxist content", partly of "philosophical dogmas", partly of nonsense, and partly of statements that—depending on how they are interpreted—could be any of these things.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Main Currents of Marxism|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = W. W. Norton and Company|year = 2005|isbn = 9780393329438|location = New York|pages = 909}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Eastman]] argued that dialectical materialism lacks a [[psychological]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dialectical Materialism|last = Oehler|first = Hugo|publisher = Demos Press|year = 1941|location = Chicago}}p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Allen W. Wood|Allen Wood]] argued that, in its form as an official Soviet philosophy, dialectical materialism was doomed to be superficial because "creativity or critical thinking" was impossible in an authoritarian environment. Nevertheless, he considered the basic aims and principles of dialectical materialism to be in harmony with rational scientific thought.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wood, Allen |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=212–3 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Revolution''', also known as the '''Third Industrial Revolution''', is the shift from [[machine|mechanical]] and [[Analogue electronics|analogue electronic]] [[technology]] to [[digital electronics]] which began anywhere from the late 1950s to the late 1970s with the adoption and proliferation of digital computers and digital record keeping that continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/digital.html|title=The Digital Revolution|last=E.

Analogous to the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], the Digital Revolution marked the beginning of the [[Information Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/Information-Age | title=Information Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agricultural Revolution led to agricultural cities in the ancient world in the [[Middle East]], [[Mesoamerica]], [[China]], the [[Indus Valley]], [[Southern Europe]] and [[South America]].

The Industrial Revolution and Digital Revolution are now taking place concurrently in [[China]] and [[India]] as people leave the rural areas for industrial and high tech cities like [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Mumbai]].

== History ==
[[File:Rings of time Information Age (Digital Revolution).jpg|thumb|Rings of time showing some important dates in Digital Revolution from 1968 to 2017]]

=== Brief history ===

The underlying technology was invented in the later half of the 19th century, including [[Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]] and the [[telegraph]]. Digital communication became economical for widespread adoption after the invention of the [[personal computer]]. [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]], a Bell Labs mathematician, is credited for having laid out the foundations of digitalization in his pioneering 1948 article, ''A Mathematical Theory of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The mathematical theory of communication|last=Shannon|first=Claude E.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1963|isbn=0252725484|edition=4. print.|location=Urbana|pages=144|author2=Weaver, Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital revolution converted technology that had been analog into a digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make   copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify the digital signal and pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely.

The turning point of the revolution was the change from analogue to digitally recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://maas.museum/about/|title=Museum Of Applied Arts And Sciences - About|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Museum Of Applied Arts And Sciences]]|access-date=22 August 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s the digital format of optical [[compact disc]]s gradually replaced [[analog electronics|analog]] formats, such as [[vinyl records]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]], as the popular medium of choice.&lt;ref&gt;"The Digital Revolution Ahead for the Audio Industry," Business Week. New York, 16 March 1981, p. 40D.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins (1947–1969) ===

In 1947, the [[transistor]] was invented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/transistor.htm|title=Transistor History - Invention of the Transistor|date=17 April 2015|publisher=|author=Phil Ament|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the way to more advanced digital computers. From the late 1940s, Universities, the Military, and Business developed computer systems, to digitally replicate and automate previously  manualy performed mathematical calculations, with the [[LEO (computer)]] being the first commercially available general purpose computer.

A key step toward mass commercialization was the advent of the [[planar process]] in 1959 by [[Jean Hoerni]], an employee of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. This enabled [[integrated circuit]]s to be mass produced using the techniques of [[photolithography]]. 

From 1969 to 1971, [[Intel]] developed the [[Intel 4004]], an early [[microprocessor]] that laid the foundations for the [[microcomputer revolution]] that began in the 1970s.

The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the [[Internet]] when a message was sent over the [[ARPANET]] in 1969.  [[Packet switching|Packet switched]] networks such as ARPANET, [[Donald Davies|Mark I]], [[CYCLADES]], [[Merit Network]], [[Tymnet]], and [[Telenet]], were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of [[Communications protocol|protocols]]. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for [[internetworking]], in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.

The [[Stewart Brand|Whole Earth]] movement of the 1960s advocated the use of new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/history-whole-earth-catalog.php|title=History of Whole Earth Catalog|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===

In the 1970s, the [[home computer]] was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blinkenlights.com/pc.shtml|title=Personal Computer Milestones|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time-sharing|time-sharing computers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ictergezocht.nl/|title=2,076 IT jobs from 492 companies|last1=Criss|first1=Fillur|date=14 August 2014|work=ICTerGezocht.nl|accessdate=19 August 2017|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[video game console]], the first coin-op video games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atari.com/history/arcadecoin-op|title=Atari - Arcade/Coin-op|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/forgotten-arcade-games-let-you-shoot-space-men-and-catc-513560652|title=Forgotten arcade games let you shoot space men and catch live lobsters|author=Vincze Miklós|work=io9|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[golden age of arcade video games]] began with [[Space Invaders]].  As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, the [[data entry clerk]].  Culled from the ranks of secretaries and typists from earlier decades, the data entry clerk's job was to convert analog data (customer records, invoices, etc.) into digital data.

=== 1980s ===

In developed nations, computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools, homes, business, and industry.  [[Automated teller machines]], [[industrial robots]], [[CGI animation|CGI]] in film and television, [[electronic music]], [[bulletin board systems]], and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s.  Millions of people purchased home computers, making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple, Commodore, and Tandy.  To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time, having sold 17 million units (by some accounts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=547|title=How many Commodore 64 computers were really sold?|work=pagetable.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1982 and 1994.

In 1984, the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting data on computer and Internet use in the United States; their first survey showed that 8.2% of all U.S. households owned a personal computer in 1984, and that households with children under the age of 18 were nearly twice as likely to own one at 15.3% (middle and upper middle class households were the most likely to own one, at 22.9%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/files/1984/p23-155.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, 15% of all U.S. households owned a computer, and nearly 30% of households with children under the age of 18 owned one.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/files/1989/p23-171.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1980s, many businesses were dependent on computers and digital technology.

Motorola created the first mobile phone, [[Motorola DynaTac]], in 1983.  However, this device used analog communication -  digital cell phones were not sold commercially until 1991 when the [[2G]] network started to be opened in [[Finland]] to accommodate the unexpected demand for cell phones that was becoming apparent in the late 1980s.

[[Compute!]] magazine predicted that [[CD-ROM]] would be the centerpiece of the revolution, with multiple household devices reading the discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true [[digital camera]] was created in 1988, and the first were marketed in December 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digicamhistory.com/1988.html|title=1988|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s, they would eclipse traditional film in popularity.

[[Digital ink and paint|Digital ink]] was also invented in the late 1980s. Disney's CAPS system (created 1988) was used for a scene in 1989's [[The Little Mermaid]] and for all their animation films between 1990's [[The Rescuers Down Under]] and 2004's Home On The Range.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989.

=== 1990s ===

The first public digital [[HDTV]] broadcast was of the [[1990 World Cup]] that June; it was played in 10 theaters in Spain and Italy. However HDTV did not become a standard until the mid-2000s outside Japan.

The [[World Wide Web]] became publicly accessible in 1991, which had been available only to government and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/08/06/20-years-ago-today-the-world-wide-web-opened-to-the-public/|title=20 years ago today, the World Wide Web was born - TNW Insider|date=6 August 2011|author=Martin Bryant|work=The Next Web|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]] introduced [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first web browser capable of displaying inline images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/background1/events/www.html|title=The World Wide Web|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the basis for later browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer.  The [[Internet]] expanded quickly, and by 1996, it was part of [[mass culture]] and many businesses listed websites in their ads. By 1999 almost every country had a connection, and nearly half of [[United States|Americans]] and people in several other countries used the [[Internet]] on a regular basis. However throughout the 1990s, "getting online" entailed complicated configuration, and [[dial-up]] was the only connection type affordable by individual users; the present day mass [[Internet culture]] was not possible.

In 1989 about 15% of all households in the [[United States]] owned a personal computer, by 2000, this was up to 51%;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p23-208.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for households with children nearly 30% owned a computer in 1989, and in 2000 65% owned one.

=== 2000s ===

[[Cell phones]] became as ubiquitous as computers by the early 2000s, with movie theaters beginning to show ads telling people to silence their phones. They also became [[smartphones|much more advanced]] than phones of the 1990s, most of which only took calls or at most allowed for the playing of simple games.

[[Text messaging]] existed in the 1990s but was not widely used until the early 2000s, when it became a cultural phenomenon.

The digital revolution became truly global in this time as well - after revolutionizing society in the [[developed world]] in the 1990s, the digital revolution spread to the masses in the [[developing world]] in the 2000s.

In late 2005 the population of the [[Internet]] reached 1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1003975|title=One Billion People Online!|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022105426/http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1003975|archive-date=22 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3 billion people worldwide used cell phones by the end of the decade. [[HDTV]] became the standard television broadcasting format in many countries by the end of the decade.

=== 2010s ===

By 2012, over 2 billion people used the Internet, twice the number using it in 2007. [[Cloud computing]] had entered the mainstream by the early 2010s. By 2015, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphones]] were expected to exceed personal computers in Internet usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/239870/tablets_phones_to_surpass_pcs_for_internet_use_in_four_years.html Tablets, Phones to Surpass PCs for Internet Use in Four Years.] PCWorld.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, half of the world's population was connected.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet Users Statistics and 2014 World Population Stats|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Analog to digital transition.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Analog to digital transition 1986 - 2014]]

In the late 1980s, less than 1% of the world's technologically stored information was in digital format, while it was 94% in 2007, with more than 99% by 2014.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], especially [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/02/08/science.1200970.DC1/Hilbert-SOM.pdf Supporting online material], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: http://www.martinhilbert.net/worldinfocapacity-html/&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2002 is estimated to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital, than in analog format (the "beginning of the [[digital age]]").&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo|title=World_info_capacity_animation|first=|last=Martin Hilbert|date=11 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Analog weighing scale to digital [[weighing scale]]

== Technological basis ==

Underlying the digital revolution was the [[History of computing hardware|development of the digital electronic computer]], the [[personal computer]], and particularly the [[microprocessor]] with its steadily increasing performance (as described by [[Moore's law]]), which enabled computer technology to be [[Embedded system|embedded]] into a huge range of objects from [[Digital photography|cameras]] to [[Digital audio player|personal music players]]. Equally important was the development of transmission technologies including [[computer network]]ing, the [[Internet]] and [[Digital audio broadcasting|digital broadcasting]]. [[3G phones]], whose social penetration grew exponentially in the 2000s, also played a very large role in the digital revolution as they simultaneously provide ubiquitous entertainment, communications, and online connectivity.

== Socio-economic impact ==

Positive aspects include greater interconnectedness, easier communication, and the exposure of information that in the past could have more easily been suppressed by [[totalitarian]] regimes. [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his books [[Physics of the Future]] that the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup of 1991]] was due largely to the existence of technology such as the [[fax machine]] and computers that exposed classified information.

The [[Revolutions of 2011]] were enabled by social networking and smartphone technology; however these revolutions in hindsight largely failed to reach their goals as hardcore Islamist governments and in Syria a [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]] have formed in the absence of the dictatorships that were toppled.

The economic impact of the digital revolution has been large. Without the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), for example, [[globalization]] and [[outsourcing]] would not be nearly as feasible as they are today. The digital revolution radically changed the way individuals and companies interact. Small regional companies were suddenly given access to much larger markets. Concepts such as [[Software as a service|On-demand]] services and manufacturing and rapidly dropping technology costs made possible innovations in all aspects of industry and everyday life.

After initial concerns of an IT [[productivity paradox]], evidence is mounting that digital technologies have significantly increased the productivity and performance of businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=290325|title=Computing Productivity: Firm-Level Evidence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative effects include [[information overload]], Internet predators, forms of social isolation, and media saturation. In a poll of prominent members of the national news media, 65 percent said the Internet is hurting journalism more than it is helping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/04/media-insiders-say-internet-hurts-journalism/307410/|title=Media Insiders Say Internet Hurts Journalism|author=Cyra Master|date=10 April 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing anyone no matter how amateur and unskilled to become a journalist; causing information to be muddier and the rise of [[conspiracy theory]] in a way it didn't exist in the past.

In some cases, company employees' pervasive use of portable digital devices and work related computers for personal use—email, instant messaging, computer games—were often found to, or perceived to, reduce those companies' productivity. Personal computing and other non-work related digital activities in the workplace thus helped lead to stronger forms of privacy invasion, such as keystroke recording and information filtering applications ([[spyware]] and [[content-control software]]).

=== Information sharing and privacy ===

[[Privacy]] in general became a concern during the digital revolution. The ability to store and utilize such large amounts of diverse information opened possibilities for tracking of individual activities and interests. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] and privacy rights advocates feared the possibility of an [[Orwellian]] future where centralized power structures control the populace via automatic surveillance and monitoring of personal information in such programs as the CIA's [[Information Awareness Office]].&lt;ref&gt;John Markoff (22 November 2002). "Pentagon Plans a Computer System That Would Peek at Personal Data of Americans". ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer and labor advocates opposed the ability to direct market to individuals, discriminate in hiring and lending decisions, invasively monitor employee behavior and communications and generally profit from involuntarily shared personal information.

The [[Internet]], especially the [[WWW]] in the 1990s, opened whole new avenues for communication and information sharing. The ability to easily and rapidly share information on a global scale brought with it a whole new level of [[freedom of speech]]. Individuals and organizations were suddenly given the ability to publish on any topic, to a global audience, at a negligible cost, particularly in comparison to any previous communication technology.

Large cooperative projects could be endeavored (e.g. [[Open-source software]] projects, [[SETI@home]]). Communities of like-minded individuals were formed (e.g. [[MySpace]], [[Tribe.net]]). Small regional companies were suddenly given access to a larger marketplace.

In other cases, special interest groups as well as social and religious institutions found much of the content objectionable, even dangerous. Many parents and religious organizations, especially in the United States, became alarmed by [[pornography]] being more readily available to minors. In other circumstances the proliferation of information on such topics as child pornography, building bombs, committing acts of terrorism, and other violent activities were alarming to many different groups of people. Such concerns contributed to arguments for censorship and regulation on the WWW.

=== Copyright and trademark issues ===
{{main|File sharing and the law}}

[[Copyright]] and [[trademark]] issues also found new life in the digital revolution. The widespread ability of consumers to produce and distribute exact reproductions of protected works dramatically changed the intellectual property landscape, especially in the music, film, and television industries.

The digital revolution, especially regarding privacy, copyright, censorship and information sharing, remains a controversial topic. As the digital revolution progresses it remains unclear to what extent society has been impacted and will be altered in the future.

== Concerns ==

While there have been huge benefits to society from the digital revolution, especially in terms of the accessibility of information, there are a number of concerns. Expanded powers of communication and information sharing, increased capabilities for existing technologies,  and the advent of new technology brought with it many potential opportunities for exploitation. The digital revolution helped usher in a new age of [[mass surveillance]], generating a range of new [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] issues. Reliability of data became an issue as information could easily be replicated, but not easily verified. The digital revolution made it possible to store and track facts, articles, statistics, as well as minutiae hitherto unfeasible.

From the perspective of the [[historian]], a large part of human history is known through physical objects from the past that have been found or preserved, particularly in written documents. Digital records are easy to create but also easy to delete and modify. Changes in [[File format|storage formats]] can make recovery of data difficult or near impossible, as can the storage of information on obsolete media for which reproduction equipment is unavailable, and even identifying what such data is and whether it is of interest can be near impossible if it is no longer easily readable, or if there is a large number of such files to identify. Information passed off as authentic research or study must be scrutinized and verified.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

These problems are further compounded by the use of [[digital rights management]] and other [[copy prevention]] technologies which, being designed to only allow the data to be read on specific machines, may well make future [[data recovery]] impossible. The [[Voyager Golden Record]], which is intended to be read by an intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] (perhaps a suitable parallel to a human from the distant future), is recorded in [[analog (signal)|analog]] rather than digital format specifically for easy interpretation and analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7412">The '''Duff Cooper Prize''' is a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of [[history]], [[biography]], [[political science]] or (very occasionally) [[poetry]], published in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. The prize was established in honour of [[Duff Cooper]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, Cabinet member and author. The prize was first awarded in 1956 to [[Alan Moorehead]] for his ''Gallipoli''. At present, the winner receives a first edition copy of Duff Cooper's autobiography ''[[Old Men Forget]]'' and a cheque for [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000.

==An overview==
After Duff Cooper's death in 1954, a group of his friends decided to establish a trust to endow a literary prize in his memory. The trust appoints five judges. Two of them are ''ex officio'': the [[List of Wardens of New College, Oxford|Warden]] of [[New College, Oxford]], and a member of Duff Cooper's family (initially, Duff Cooper's son, [[John Julius Norwich]] for the first thirty-six years, and then John Julius' daughter, [[Artemis Cooper]]). The other three judges appointed by the trust serve for five years and they appoint their own successors. The first three judges were [[Maurice Bowra]], [[Cyril Connolly]] and [[Raymond Mortimer]]. At present, the three appointed judges are writer and biographer [[Patrick Marnham]], film critic John McBratney, and former ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'' editor Lindsay Duguid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theduffcooperprize.org/duff-cooper-prize-history|title=History|publisher=The Duff Cooper Prize official website|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2013, the prize has been known as The Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize, following a sponsorship by [[Pol Roger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=London Evening Standard|title=Champagne days for winners of the Duff Cooper Prize|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/champagne-days-for-winners-of-the-duff-cooper-prize-8504983.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Human history|222}}

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese dynasties ===
[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

At the start of the modern era, the [[Spice Route]] between India and China crossed [[Majapahit]],&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_19"&gt;M.C. Ricklefs, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

|&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; European events and dates &lt;/div&gt;
The beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted as in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this transitional phase from medieval to early modern Europe can be noted:
* 1415 – [[Battle of Ceuta|Conquest of Ceuta]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]
* 1444 – [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[Movable type]]

* 1485 – England's last [[Plantagenet]] king, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] dies
* 1486 – [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] publishes his "900 Theses"
* 1492 – [[Christopher Columbus]] leads a Spanish fleet to America.
* 1494 – French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] invaded Italy
* 1498 – A Portuguese fleet, led by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrives in [[India]]
* 1517 – [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] begins with [[Martin Luther]]
* 1532 – [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''
* 1543 — [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]''
* 1545 – [[Council of Trent]] is convened
* 1648 – [[Peace of Westphalia]] ends the [[Thirty Years War]].

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|-
|}
In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and "[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the "[[Big Band|Big Band era]]", "[[Disco era]]", etc.

'''Euhemerism''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|h|iː|m|ər|ɪ|z|əm|,_|-|h|ɛ|m|-}}) is an approach to the interpretation of [[mythology]] in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural [[mores]]. It was named for the Greek mythographer [[Euhemerus]], who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'', euhemerism is termed the "historical theory" of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. ''Bulfinch's Mythology''. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of [[Xenophanes]], [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis: "Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete" The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337–340) p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] presented rationalized accounts of the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (''Histories'' I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (''Histories'' 2.118ff).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as [[Ennius]] and [[Antoine Banier]] identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to mythology'', [[Lewis Spence]], 1921, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In a scene described in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Socrates]] offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]:

{{quote|"{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Tell me, Socrates, isn't it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithyia away?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: So they say.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Couldn't this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.&lt;br&gt; {{smallcaps|Socrates}}: No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: I hadn't noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas..."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedr. 229b–d, translation taken from:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] abducting [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of "absurd forms" such as [[Centaurs]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] could not easily be explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 229d&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient [[skeptic]] philosophical tradition of [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] and the [[Cyrenaics]], Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of [[Greek mythology]] could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an [[atheism|atheist]] by his opponents, most notably [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deification===

Euhemerus' views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through [[apotheosis]]. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], the tyrant ruler of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus' views on the origin of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211–242.&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and "[[pharaoh|pharaoization]]" of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that [[Zeus]] was a mortal king who died on [[Crete]], and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete'', S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered [[Atheism|atheists]], and Epimenides called them all liars (see [[Epimenides paradox]]). [[Callimachus]], an opponent of Euhemerus' views on [[mythology]], argued that Zeus' Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

{{cquote|''Cretans always lie.'' For the Cretans even built a tomb,&lt;br&gt; 
Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Zeus''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A later Latin [[scholia|scholium]] on the ''Hymns'' of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: "The tomb of [[Minos]], the son of [[jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]" but over time the words "Minos, the son" wore away leaving only "the tomb of Jupiter".  This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the ''Coma Berenices'' of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the ''Encomium of Ptolemy'' by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Euhemerus, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century AD claimed that [[Pythagoras]] had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb's surface an inscription reading: "Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus".&lt;ref&gt;Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christians==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the [[Church Fathers]], embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s triumphant cry in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'': "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]], has a passage, {{bibleref|Wisdom|14:12–21}}, giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.{{wikisource|Wisdom (Bible)}}

===Early Christian apologists===

The [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologists]] deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of [[fable]]s of human invention. [[Cyprian]], a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay ''De idolorum vanitate'' ("On the Vanity of Idols") in AD 247 that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

{{quote|That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation.}}

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the [[apotheosis]] of [[Melicertes]] and [[Leucothea]]; "The Castors [i.e. [[Castor and Pollux]]] die by turns, that they may live," a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. "The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown," Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and [[Dionysus]] but showing that the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian's argument to marginalize the [[syncretism]] of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

{{quote|From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar.}}

Eusebius in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God [[Baʿal]] was a deified ruler and that the god [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] was the first Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in [[Tertullian]] (''De idololatria''), the ''Octavius'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] and in [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: "Contra Celsum" III 22–43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]]' dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. [[Isidore of Seville]], compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter ''De diis gentium''&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'', book viii, ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from [[Lactantius]], ''Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur.'' ("Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men.") Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore's euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in [[Petrus Comestor]]'s appendix to his much translated ''Historia scholastica'' (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan [[legend]], as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Seznec 1995:16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin of Braga]] in his ''De correctione rusticorum'' wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah's family who began to worship the [[Sun]] and stars instead of [[deity|God]]. In his view the Greek gods were deified descendants of [[Noah]] who were once real personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_|title=Chapter 4: Pagan Survivals in Galicia in the Sixth Century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to embrace euhemerism, such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Petrus Comestor]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Godfrey of Viterbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as [[Minerva]], [[Prometheus]], Atlas, [[Apollo]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] were all deified humans. – ''Opus Maius'', ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
“After all, it was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus' Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.” Other modern theorists labeled Euhemerism as a “subject of classical paganism that was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realization that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had  been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.” (John Daniel Cook)

===Christ myth theory===

In his 2011 book, ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', [[Robert M. Price]] supported the [[Christ myth theory]] and suggested that the process of searching for a historical Jesus was like euhemerism.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M, ( 2011) ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', American Atheist Press. {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}} p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snorri Sturluson's "euhemerism"==
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. [[Odin]], the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from [[Asia Minor]], tracing his ancestry back to [[Priam]], the king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. 
As Odin travels north to settle in the [[Nordic countries]], he establishes the royal families ruling in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] at the time:

{{quote|And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men.&lt;ref&gt;Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, ''Edda''. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while Snorri's euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') to hint that the 'divinisation' was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers.

==In the modern world==

Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the [[early modern period]] from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;For example in the preface to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid's pagan stories. He argues: 'The true and everliving God the [[Paynim]]s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow'.&lt;/ref&gt; to modern times. In 1711, the French historian [[Antoine Banier]] in his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' ("The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise of modern mythology, 1680–1860'', Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson'', Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Bryant]]'s ''A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, [[George Stanley Faber]] was another Biblical euhemerist. His work ''The Origin of Pagan Idolatry'' (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of [[Homer]]. He excavated [[Troy]] and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the [[Mask of Agamemnon]] and [[Priam's Treasure]].

[[Herbert Spencer]] embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]]. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer [[Robert Graves]] offered many such "euhemerist" interpretations in his telling of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn= 9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21150">The '''European Association of History Educators''' (EUROCLIO) was established in 1992 with the support of the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[NGO]] works as a European wide facilitator for innovation and progress in history Education. The organisation contributes not only to the development, but also on the actual implementation of regional, national and European long-term projects, which focus on establishing knowledge, experience and expertise in the countries by training and consulting teachers. EUROCLIO develops teaching materials, builds and maintains professional Networks and acts as advisor to governments, international organisations, [[NGO]]s, History Teacher Associations and other Organisations. EUROCLIO is supported by the [[Europe for Citizens]] Programme of the European Union and has, for many years, Official Participatory Status and is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Stake Holder's Network in Education and Training.

== Background ==

=== History ===
EUROCLIO was officially founded in 1993, but already in 1992, delegates from [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (14 countries), representing 18 history Teachers Associations decided that a European organization was needed to support the learning and teaching of history by sharing and exchanging knowledge and professional experience. EUROCLIO was founded by [[Joke van der Leeuw-Roord]]. The immediate cause for the foundation of such an institute was the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 and the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1992. These events changed the scope and perspective of history and history education in Europe completely and for many countries, a European dimension in history education suddenly became possible and important for the future. History education is frequently used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]], hatred and aggression, but now the decision was made to renew contacts between East and West and reinforce a history education that could act as a tool to foster integration, peace and stability in Europe. From 1993 on, EUROCLIO grew rapidly and today it represents 64 member organizations from 46 (mostly) European countries, connecting 40,000 historians and history educators in primary, secondary and higher educational institutes.

=== Mission  ===

The organization supports the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

EUROCLIO focuses on three target areas:
* Intense professional capacity building and knowledge exchange, with a focus on the development of innovative and responsible high quality teaching professionals and the development and implementation of contemporary, class-room applicable teaching materials.
*  Dialogue, national, cross-community and trans-border networking and dissemination of information with the goal of maintaining and extending this network through all means available.
* Developing participatory and sustainable, professional civil society networks by establishing and empowering independent History Educators Associations in all European countries and beyond. These organisations act as multipliers of the EUROCLIO work on national levels.

== Activities ==

=== Teacher Training and Conferences ===

Each year, EUROCLIO organises an International Training and Development Course where, on average, History Educators from more than 35 countries meet, learn and discuss a variety of topics and good practice to broaden their perspectives. These Annual Conferences take place in different countries and in close co-operation with local History Teachers’ Associations. In 2009, the Conference was in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], on the theme “Taking the Perspective of the Others: Intercultural Dialogue and History Teaching”. This Conference is co-organised by nine Teacher Unions and History Educators’ Associations from across the divide.

All EUROCLIO Teacher Training activities are in close co-operation with both local academics and institutes for history teacher education, and international experts to train history teachers how to use the most modern teaching methods in their classes. For example: history educators everywhere recognise the importance of ICT as a learning and communications tool, and want further training in how to develop these areas and how to extend their skills in using ICT to promote historical understanding and learning. EUROCLIO operates through the medium of English for international work, and in home languages with translations for the experts supporting projects and in developmental work.

Since its foundation, EUROCLIO has organised more than 30 International Conferences and more than 70 National and Regional Training and Development Courses.

=== Programmes ===

EUROCLIO implements several long term programmes:
* '''International Trainings''' provides cross-border professional capacity building for history, heritage and citizenship educators related to innovative and responsible history education.
* '''Historiana - Your Portal to the Past''' promotes digital literacy through history, heritage and citizenship education by means of an on-line multimedia tool, offering students multi-perspective, cross-border and comparative historical resources supplementing their national history teaching tools.
* '''History that Connects in the Western Balkans''' restores the professional relations between history, heritage and citizenship educators and explores opportunities for a collaborative approach to teaching history in the region, including sensitive and controversial issues.
* '''Mediterranean Dialogues''' enables educators across the Euro-Mediterranean region to open a common dialogue, to share experiences and to develop cross-community and cross-border cooperation and networks.
* '''Innovating History Education in the Black Sea Region''' raises awareness in this region for approaches in history, heritage and citizenship education, which enhance democracy and intercultural dialogue and is creating sustainable national and cross border networks.

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Golden-age-mu-map.jpg|thumb|The metaphor of a ''Golden Age'' is often invoked for high points of lost knowledge in the mythical past]]

A '''golden age''' is a period in a field of endeavor when [[greatness|great]] tasks were accomplished. The term originated from early [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] poets, who used it to refer to a time when mankind lived in a better time and was pure (see [[Golden Age]]).

The [[ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Hesiod]] introduced the term in his ''[[Works and Days]]'', when referring to the period when the "Golden Race" of man lived. This was part of fivefold division of [[Ages of Man]], starting with the Golden age, then the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Age of Heroes]] (including the [[Trojan War]]), and finally, the current Iron Age.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=R.C.|title=An Introduction to Hesiod’s ''Works and Days''|journal=The Review of Politics|year=2006|volume=68|pages=177–205|doi=10.1017/S003467050600009X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=441023&amp;jid=ROP&amp;volumeId=68&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=441022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further refined by [[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', into the four "metal ages" (golden, silver, bronze, and iron).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses''. Trans. A.D. Melville. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986. Print. Pages ix–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the Golden Age is always in the past.

The Golden age as described by Hesiod was an age where all humans were created directly by the Olympian gods. They did not have women in their ranks, and could not reproduce. They lived long lives in peace and harmony, and were oblivious of death. The "Golden race" were however mortals, but would die peacefully and in their sleep unmarked by sickness and age.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He described it as a time before man learned the art of navigation, and as a pre-agricultural society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDermott|first=E.|title='The Metal Face of the Age': Hesiod, Vergil, and the Iron  Age on Cold Mountain|journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition|year=2011|volume=17|issue=2|pages=244–256|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225184443/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi|archivedate=2011-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Golden age lingered in literature and historical understanding throughout the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref name="tertullian1"&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Jerome |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_01_prefaces.htm |title=St. Jerome, Chronicle (2004-5).

==Evolution from period to metaphor==
The term "Golden age" has always had a metaphoric element. A few centuries after Hesiod, [[Plato]] pointed out that the "Golden race" were not made from gold as such, but that the term should be understood metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boys-Stones|first=edited by G.R.|title=Plato and Hesiod|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199236343|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|author2=Haubold, J.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical idea of the "metal ages" as actual historical periods held sway throughout the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref name="tertullian1"/&gt; While supplemented by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s "[[Six Ages of the World]]", the classical ideas were never entirely eradicated, and it resurfaced to form the basis of division of time in early [[archaeology]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

At the birth of modern archaeology in the 18th century, the "Golden age" was associated with a pre-agricultural society. However, already in the 16th century, the term "Golden age" was replaced by "[[Stone age]]" in the [[three-age system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | title=Questioning Thunderstones and Arrowheads: The Problem of Recognizing and Interpreting Stone Artifacts in the Seventeenth Century | first=Matthew R. | last=Goodrum | journal=Early Science and Medicine | volume=13 | year=2008 | pages=482–508 | doi=10.1163/157338208X345759 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Gräslund | first=Bo |year=1987 |title=The Birth of Prehistoric Chronology. Dating methods and dating systems in nineteenth-century Scandinavian archeology | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] used the term for a loosely defined historical period characterized by the "[[State of nature]]" as late as the during the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartzog|first=P.B.|title=Rousseau and Marx on Equality: Paradise Lost, Paradise Restored|url=http://www.panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Rousseau%20and%20Marx%20on%20Equality.pdf|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510191449/http://www.panarchy.com/Members/PaulBHartzog/Papers/Rousseau%20and%20Marx%20on%20Equality.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of an Iron and Bronze Age are still used by historians and archaeologists, the "Golden age" of Hesiod was a purely mythical period, and has come to signify any period in history where the state of affairs for a specific phenomenon appear to have been on their height, better than in the periods proceeding it and following the "Golden Age". It is sometimes still employed for the [[hunter-gatherer]] tribal societies of the [[Mesolithic]], but only as a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[David Maybury-Lewis]]|title=Millennium : tribal wisdom and the modern world|year=1992|publisher=Viking|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A.|isbn=0-670-82935-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and technology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
A golden age is often ascribed to the years immediately following some technological innovation. It is during this time that writers and artists ply their skills to this new medium.  Therefore, there are Golden Ages of both [[radio]] and [[television]].  During this nascent phase the technology allows new ideas to be expressed, as new art forms flower quickly into new areas:

*Golden age of illustration, a [[Illustration#Golden age of illustration|period in US illustration history]] from the 1880s to the 1910s.
*[[old-time radio|The Golden Age of Radio]], 1920s–1940s
*[[The Golden Age of American animation]], between 1928 (sound) and the 1960s (television).
* The [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s
*[[Golden Age of Television]] (referring to U.S. television circa 1950s) when [[television]] was still a fairly recent invention. Programs such as ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', and later ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' brought a level of writing to American commercial television that would rarely be seen in the next several decades.

The '''Great Divergence''' is a term made popular by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]'s book by that title, (also known as the '''European miracle''', a term coined by [[Eric Jones (economic historian)|Eric Jones]] in 1981){{sfn|Jones|2003}} referring to the process by which the [[Western world]] (i.e. [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]], eclipsing [[Medieval India]], [[Qing China]], the [[Islamic World]], [[Joseon Korea]], and [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]].

Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, [[colonialism]], resources, and "accidents of history".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

''Technological Forecasting and Social Change''. Volume 95, June 2015, Page 163].&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances, in areas such as [[railroads]], [[steamboats]], [[mining]], and [[agriculture]], were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of [[coal]] as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production.

==Terminology and definition==

The term "Great Divergence" was coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} in 1996 and used by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] in his book ''The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy'' (2000). The same phenomenon was discussed by [[Eric Jones (historian)|Eric Jones]], whose 1981 book ''[[The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia]]'' popularized the alternate term "European Miracle".{{sfn|Jones|2003}} Broadly, both terms signify a [[socioeconomic]] shift in which European countries advanced ahead of others during the [[modern period]].{{sfn|Frank|2001}}

The timing of the Great Divergence is in dispute among historians. The traditional dating is as early as the 16th (or even 15th&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.,

==Conditions in pre-Great Divergence cores==

Unlike modern industrial economies, pre-modern economies were constrained by conditions which greatly limited economic growth. Although core regions in Eurasia had achieved a relatively high standard of living by the 18th century, shortages of land, soil degradation, deforestation, lack of dependable energy sources, and other ecological constraints limited growth in per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=219}} Rapid rates of depreciation on capital meant that a great part of savings in pre-modern economies were spent on replacing depleted capital, hampering [[capital accumulation]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Massive windfalls of fuel, land, food and other resources were necessary for continued growth and capital accumulation, leading to [[colonialism]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=241}}
The Industrial Revolution overcame these restraints, allowing rapid, sustained growth in per capita incomes for the first time in human history.

===Western Europe===

After the [[Viking]], Muslim and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions waned in the 10th century, Europe entered a period of prosperity, population growth and territorial expansion known as the [[High Middle Ages]].
Trade and commerce revived, with increased specialization between areas and between the countryside and artisans in towns.
By the 13th century the best land had been occupied and agricultural income began to fall, though trade and commerce continued to expand, especially in [[Venice]] and other northern Italian cities.
The 14th century brought a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]]: famines, wars, the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics.
The resulting drop in the population led to falling rents and rising wages, undermining the [[feudal]] and [[manorial]] relationships that had characterized Medieval Europe.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=11–13}}

According to a 2014 study, "there was a ‘little divergence’ within Europe between 1300 and 1800: real wages in the North Sea area more or less stabilized at the level attained after the Black Death, and remained relatively high (above subsistence) throughout the early modern period (and into the nineteenth century); whereas, on the other hand, real wages in the ‘periphery’ (in Germany, Italy, and Spain) began to fall after the fifteenth century and returned to some kind of subsistence minimum during the 1500–1800 period. This ‘little divergence’ in real wages mirrors a similar divergence in GDP per capita: in the ‘periphery’ of Europe there was almost no per capita growth (or even a decline) between 1500 and 1800, whereas in Holland and England real income continued to rise and more or less doubled in this period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolt|first=Jutta|last2=van Zanden|first2=Jan Luiten|date=2014-08-01|title=The Maddison Project: collaborative research on historical national accounts|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=627–651|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12032|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Exploration]] navigators discovered new routes to the Americas and Asia.
Commerce expanded, together with innovations such as [[joint stock companies]] and various financial institutions.
New military technologies favored larger units, leading to a concentration of power in states whose finances relied on trade.
France and Spain developed absolute monarchies reliant on high taxes and state-backed monopolies, leading to economic decline.
The [[Dutch Republic]] was controlled by merchants, while [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] gained control of England after a long struggle culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]].
These arrangements proved more hospitable to economic development.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=16–18}}
At the end of the 16th century London and Antwerp began pulling away from other European cities, as illustrated in the following graph of real wages in several European cities:{{sfn|Allen|2001}}

[[File:European cities real wages.png|600px|center]]

The West had a series of unique advantages compared to Asia, such as the proximity of coal mines; the discovery of the [[New World]], which alleviated ecological restraints on economic growth (land shortages etc.); and the profits from colonization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=31–69, 187}}

===China===

[[File:China Europe population 1000-1975.svg|thumb|Comparative populations (millions, log scale) of China and Continental Europe between 1000 and 1975.{{sfn|Feuerwerker|1990|p=227}}]]
China had a larger population than Europe throughout the Common Era.{{sfn|Feuerwerker|1990|p=227}}
Unlike Europe, it was politically united for long periods during that time.

During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=7, 113–199}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen N.|last2=Guan|first2=Hanhui|last3=Li|first3=David D.|date=2017-04-01|title=China, Europe and the Great Divergence: A Study in Historical National Accounting, 980-1850|ssrn=2957511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastery of [[paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jurchen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics. The result was a dramatic shift in the center of population and industry from the home of Chinese civilization around the [[Yellow River]] to the south of the country, a trend only partially reversed by the re-population of the north from the 15th century.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=204–205}} By 1300, China had fallen behind Italy in living standards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21723459-how-will-affect-xis-chinese-dream-china-has-been-poorer-europe-longer-party|title=China has been poorer than Europe longer than the party thinks|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-06-22|date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Late Imperial China|late imperial period]] (1368–1911), comprising the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, [[Taxation in premodern China|taxation]] was low, and the economy and population grew significantly, though without substantial increases in productivity.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=91–92, 203–204}}
Chinese goods such as [[silk]], [[tea]] and [[ceramic art|ceramics]] were in great demand in Europe, leading to an inflow of silver, expanding the money supply and facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|pp=587, 590}}
By the end of the 18th century, population density levels exceeded those in Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=569}} China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=579}} The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750, before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen|last2=Gupta|first2=Bishnupriya|date=2006-02-01|title=The early modern great divergence: wages, prices and economic development in Europe and Asia, 1500–18001|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=2–31|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00331.x|issn=1468-0289|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1709/1/WRAP_Broadberry_CEPR-DP4947%5B1%5D.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist scholarship, however, estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=36, 219–225}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|pages=101–108|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[early modern Europe]], there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as [[spice]]s, [[Black pepper|pepper]]s, [[indigo]], [[silk]]s, and [[saltpeter]] (for use in [[munitions]]).&lt;ref name="schmidt"&gt;Karl J.

===Middle East===
{{Main|Economic history of the Ottoman Empire}}

The [[Middle East]] was more advanced than Western Europe in 1000 CE, on par by the middle of the 16th century, but by 1750, leading Middle-Eastern states had fallen behind the leading Western European states of Britain and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|date=2017-06-15|title=Jared Rubin: Rulers, religion, and riches: Why the West got rich and the Middle East did not?|journal=Public Choice|language=en|pages=1–4|doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0464-6|issn=0048-5829|volume=172|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Islahi|first=Abdul Azim|title=Book review.

An example of a Middle-Eastern country that had an advanced economy in the early 19th century was [[Ottoman Egypt]], which had a highly productive industrial [[manufacturing]] sector, and [[per-capita income]] that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as [[France]] and higher than that of [[Japan]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="batou" /&gt; Other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], particularly [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and southeastern [[Anatolia]], also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began programs of state-sponsored [[industrialization]], which included setting up factories for weapons production, an [[iron]] [[foundry]], large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for [[ginning]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing. By the early 1830s, Egypt had 30 [[cotton mill]]s, employing about 30,000 workers.&lt;ref name="lockman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes on Egyptian Workers' History|author=Zachary Lockman|journal=International Labor and Working-Class History|issue=18|date=Fall 1980|pages=1–12|jstor=27671322}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, Egypt had the world's fifth most productive [[cotton industry]], in terms of the number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|page=181|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as [[animal power]], [[water wheel]]s, and [[windmill]]s, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870.&lt;ref name="batou193"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA193|pages=193–196|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[steam power]] had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer [[Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]] in 1551, when he invented a [[steam jack]] driven by a rudimentary [[steam turbine]],&lt;ref name="Hassan"&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]] (1976), ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', p. 34–35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, [[University of Aleppo]]&lt;/ref&gt; it was under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in the early 19th century that [[steam engine]]s were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt; [[Boiler]]s were manufactured and installed in Egyptian industries such as [[ironworks]], textile manufacturing, [[paper mill]]s, and [[hulling]] mills. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the [[Nile]]. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

After the death of Muhammad Ali in 1849, his industrialization programs fell into decline, after which, according to historian Zachary Lockman, “Egypt was well on its way to full integration into a European-dominated world market as supplier of a single raw material, cotton.” Lockman argues that, had Egypt succeeded in its industrialization programs, “it might have shared with Japan [or the United States] the distinction of achieving autonomous capitalist development and preserving its independence.”&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt;

===Japan===

Japanese society was governed by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], which divided Japanese society into a strict hierarchy and intervened considerably in the economy through state monopolies{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=251}} and [[Sakoku Edict of 1635|restrictions on foreign trade]]; however, in practice, the Shogunate's rule was often circumvented.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=214}} From 725-1974, Japan experienced GDP per capita growth at an annual rate of 0.04%, with major periods of positive per capita GDP growth occurring during 1150-1280, 1450-1600 and after 1730.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Oxford-Economic-and-Social-History-Working-Papers/japan-and-the-great-divergence-730-1874|title=Japan and the Great Divergence, 730-1874 {{!}} Oxford Economic and Social History Working Papers {{!}} Working Papers|website=www.economics.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no significant periods of sustained growth reversals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relative to the United Kingdom, GDP per capita was at roughly similar levels until the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan and the Great Divergence|last=Francks|first=Penelope|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|pages=31–38|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-57673-6_4|chapter = Japan in the Great Divergence Debate: The Quantitative Story|isbn = 978-1-137-57672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, per capita incomes in Japan were approximately a quarter of the British level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, 18th-century Japan had a higher [[life expectancy]], 41.1 years for adult males,{{failed verification|date= January 2018}} compared with 31.6 to 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}}

===Korea===

In its earlier days, Korea had healthy international trading relationships, receiving merchants from as far as the Middle East.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=137}}  Because of its strategic value to its neighboring countries, however, Korea had been invaded several times during its Goryeo and Joseon eras, starting with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Though repelled due to its strong navy and aid from China, the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century were particularly devastating to the peninsula and it never truly recovered until the modern era.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=165–168, 229–250}} Due to relatively frequent invasions, increased Western colonization of Asia, and the arrival of Christian missionaries, Korea began a long period of isolationism, maintaining diplomatic relationships primarily with China only.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=274}} For the rest of the Joseon period, the country was marred by economic hardships, peasant revolts, and political factionalism until it was annexed by Japan in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=270–273}}

Pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa was politically fragmented, just as early modern Europe was.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/state-capacity-and-economic-development/650D0C46C22E8BB53D3F5A47F085DB78|title=State Capacity and Economic Development by Mark Dincecco|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa was however far more sparsely populated than Europe.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to University of Michigan political scientist Mark Dincecco, "the high land/ labor ratio may have made it less likely that historical institutional centralization at the “national level” would occur in sub-Saharan Africa, thwarting further state development."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The transatlantic slave trade may have further weakened state power in Africa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Possible factors==

Scholars have proposed numerous theories to explain why the Great Divergence occurred.

===Coal===
[[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|upright|The distribution of coal deposits shaped industrial development in Britain.]]
In metallurgy and steam engines the Industrial Revolution made extensive use of coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] - as cheaper, more plentiful and more efficient than wood and [[charcoal]].
Coal-fired steam engines also operated in the railways and in shipping, revolutionizing transport in the early 19th century.

Kenneth Pomeranz drew attention to differences in the availability of coal between West and East. Due to regional climate, European coal mines were wetter, and deep mines did not become practical until the introduction of the [[Newcomen steam engine]] to pump out groundwater.  In mines in the arid northwest of China, ventilation to prevent explosions was much more difficult.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=65}}

Another difference involved geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable mining technologies, the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits differed vastly. The largest coal deposits in China are located in the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the [[Northern Song]] (960-1127). During the 11th century China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}} The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some small coal deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=62–66}} - all within a relatively compact island.

[[Ottoman Egypt]], which used steam power for industrial manufacturing [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali|under Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (ruled 1805-1848), had a lack of coal resources. However, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits, and [[boiler]]s were manufactured and installed in various industries. Egypt also imported coal from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Cairo gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]], which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that, in addition to having the necessary conditions for rapid industrialization, Egypt also had the necessary conditions for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Efficiency of markets and state intervention===
A common argument is that Europe had more free and efficient markets than other civilizations, which has been cited as a reason for the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=70}} In Europe, market efficiency was disrupted by the prevalence of [[feudalism]] and [[mercantilism]]. Practices such as [[entail]], which restricted land ownership, hampered the free flow of labor and buying and selling of land. These feudal restrictions on land ownership were especially strong in continental Europe. China had a relatively more liberal land market, hampered only by weak customary traditions.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}} Bound labor, such as [[serfdom]] and [[slavery]] were more prevalent in Europe than in China, even during the Manchu conquest.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=82}} Urban industry in the West was more restrained by [[guild]]s and state-enforced monopolies than in China, where in the 18th century the principal monopolies governed salt and foreign trade through [[Guangzhou]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=87, 196}}  Pomeranz rejects the view that market institutions were the cause of the Great Divergence, and concludes that China was closer to the ideal of a market economy than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] presents a contrary argument, that Western countries such as the United States, Britain and Spain did not initially have [[free trade]], but had [[protectionist]] policies in the early 19th century, as did China and Japan. In contrast, he cites the [[Ottoman Empire]] as an example of a state that did have free trade, which he argues had a negative economic impact and contributed to its [[deindustrialization]]. The Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports, which has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to only 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate:&lt;ref name="bairoch31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been free trade in Turkey, and what has it produced? It has destroyed some of the finest manufactures of the world. As late as 1812 these manufactures existed; but they have been destroyed. That was the consequences of competition in Turkey, and its effects have been as pernicious as the effects of the contrary principle in Spain.}}

===State prohibition of new technology===
[[Jared Diamond]] in the book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' argues that explicit outlawing of new technology was an important explanation for the divergence. For example, in China in 1432, a new Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was the world leader at the time. Diamond traces this to differences in geography. Outside Europe advanced cultures developed in areas whose [[geography]] was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires. In these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist. On the other hand, Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, as its many natural barriers (mountains, rivers) provide defensible borders. As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly. He argues that geographical factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change (Spain succeeded by France and then by the United Kingdom) than was possible elsewhere in Eurasia.

===Innovation===
Beginning in the early 19th century, economic prosperity rose greatly in the West due to improvements in technological efficiency,{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} as evidenced by the advent of new conveniences including the [[railroad]], steamboat, steam engine, and the use of [[coal]] as a fuel source.  These innovations contributed to the Great Divergence, elevating [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] to high economic standing relative to the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

It has been argued the attitude of the [[Eastern world|East]] towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to [[David Landes]], after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement on the basis of their indigenous traditions and achievements.{{sfn|Landes|2006|p=5}} The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.{{sfn|Lin|1995|p=276}}

In the early 19th century, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began a program of state-sponsored [[industrialization]],&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt; quick to adopt [[steam engine]] technology, and manufacturing [[boiler]]s for installation in a number of industries, including [[ironworks]], [[textile manufacturing]], [[paper mill]]s, and [[hulling]] mills.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt; While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits in Egypt while importing coal from overseas at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s when Egypt gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]] with its yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that Egypt had the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization in the early 19th century, and for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Wages and living standards===
Classical economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]] and [[Thomas Malthus]], argued that high wages in the West stimulated labor-saving technological advancements.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=49}}{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=525–526}} Economic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, more recent studies have depicted [[living standards]] in 18th century China and pre-Industrial Revolution Europe as comparable.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=36}} Life expectancy in China and Japan for adult males were 39.6 and 41.1 respectively, compared with 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}} Chinese laborers in the Yangtze delta consumed 4,600 calories per day on average (laborers in China overall consumed 2,637 calories on average) compared with 2,000-2,500 calories per day for England.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=39}} According to Pomeranz and others, there was modest per capita growth in both regions,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=107}} the Chinese economy was not stagnant, and in many areas, especially agriculture, was ahead of Western Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=45–48}} Chinese cities were also ahead in public health.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=46}} Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] estimated that China's GNP per capita in 1800 was $228 in 1960 [[US dollars]] (${{Inflation|US|228|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than Western Europe's $213 (${{Inflation|US|213|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars) at the time.&lt;ref name="braude534"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century|volume=3|author=[[Fernand Braudel]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1982|page=534|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&amp;pg=PA534|isbn=9780520081161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been similar findings for India. [[Real wages]] and living standards in 18th-century [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}}&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; Workers in the [[textile industry]], for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}} In the late 18th century, Mysore's average [[per-capita income]] was five times higher than [[subsistence]] level,{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|p=45}} i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 [[international dollars]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Economy Volume 1: A Millennial Perspective Volume 2: Historical Statistics|author=[[Angus Maddison]]|publisher=Academic Foundation|year=2007|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I242EL00ieAC&amp;pg=PA260|isbn=9788171886135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2007), ''Contours of the World Economy, 1–2030 AD. Essays in Macro-Economic History'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-922721-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;382, table A.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly for [[Ottoman Egypt]], its per-capita income in 1800 was comparable to that of leading Western European countries such as [[France]], and higher than the overall average income of Europe and Japan.&lt;ref name="batou"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|pages=181–196|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian Jean Barou estimated that, in terms of 1960 dollars, [[Egypt]] in 1800 had a per-capita income of $232 (${{Inflation|US|232|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars). In comparison, per-capita income in terms of 1960 dollars for France in 1800 was $240 (${{Inflation|US|240|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), for [[Eastern Europe]] in 1800 was $177 (${{Inflation|US|177|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), and for Japan in 1800 was $180 (${{Inflation|US|180|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref name="batou189"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty From The Wealth of Nations: Integration and Polarization in the Global Economy since 1760|author=[[M.

According to Paul Bairoch, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"/&gt; He estimated that, in 1750, the average [[GNP per capita]] in the [[Eastern world]] (particularly China, India and the Middle East) was $188 in 1960 dollars (${{Inflation|US|188|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than the West's $182 (${{Inflation|US|182|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|page=104|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it was after 1800 that Western European per-capita income pulled ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John M.

===European colonialism===
A number of economic historians have argued that [[European colonialism]] played a major role in the [[deindustrialization]] of non-Western societies. [[Paul Bairoch]], for example, cites [[British colonialism]] in India as a primary example, but also argues that European [[colonialism]] played a major role in the deindustrialization of other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and [[Latin America]], and contributed to a sharp economic decline in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=88–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern [[Economic history|economic historians]] have blamed [[British Empire|British colonial rule]] for India's deindustrialization in particular.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; The colonization of India is seen as a major factor behind both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt;

Up until the 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer,{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} with [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] the centers of cotton production.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}} In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress for [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], while implementing [[protectionist]] policies such as bans and [[tariff]]s to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Process of Economic Development|author=James Cypher|year=2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxFxAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|isbn=9781136168284}}&lt;/ref&gt; India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large [[captive market]] for British manufactured goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India|author=[[Henry Yule]], [[A. C. Burnell]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the capital amassed from [[Bengal]] following its conquest after the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of [[British India]]'s economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colonial Power, Colonial Texts: India in the Modern British Novel|first=M.

===Luxury consumption===
Luxury consumption is regarded by many scholars to have stimulated the development of [[capitalism]] and thus contributed to the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=114–115}} Proponents of this view argue that workshops, which manufactured luxury articles for the wealthy, gradually amassed capital to expand their production and then emerged as large firms producing for a mass market; they believe that Western Europe's unique tastes for luxury stimulated this development further than other cultures. However, others counter that luxury workshops were not unique to Europe; large cities in China and Japan also possessed many luxury workshops for the wealthy,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=163}} and that luxury workshops do not necessarily stimulate the development of "capitalistic firms".{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=164}}

===Property rights===
Differences in property rights have been cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Weingast|first2=Barry R.|date=1989|title=Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England|jstor=2122739|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=49|issue=4|pages=803–832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James|date=2005|title=The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change, and Economic Growth|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=546–579|doi=10.1257/0002828054201305|issn=0002-8282|hdl=1721.1/64034}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view states that Asian merchants could not develop and accumulate capital because of the risk of state expropriation and claims from fellow kinsmen, which made property rights very insecure compared to those of Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=169}} However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and that the threat of expropriation by Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=170}}

Government and policies are seen as an integral part of modern societies and have played a major role in how different economies have been formed. The Eastern societies had governments which were controlled by the ruling dynasties and thus, were not a separate entity. Their governments at the time lacked policies that fostered innovation and thus resulted in slow advancements. As explained by Cohen, the east had a restrictive system of trade that went against the free world market theory; there was no political liberty or policies that encouraged the capitalist market (Cohen, 1993). This was in contrast to the western society that developed commercial laws and property rights which allowed for the protection and liberty of the marketplace. Their capitalist ideals and market structures encouraged innovation.{{sfn|Landes|2006}}{{sfn|Lin|1995}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|year=1986|publisher=New York Basic Books |title=How The West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation Of The Industrial World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waley-Cohen|first=Joanna|title=China and Western Technology in the Late Eighteenth Century|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1993|volume=99|issue=5|pages=1525–1544|jstor=2167065|doi=10.2307/2167065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomeranz (2000) argues that much of the land market in China was free, with many supposedly hereditary tenants and landlords being frequently removed or forced to sell their land. Although Chinese customary law specified that people within the village were to be offered the land first, Pomeranz states that most of the time the land was offered to more capable outsiders, and argues that China actually had a freer land market than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}
Pomeranz does not address the most common form of land sale, known as the conditional sale. The conditional sale allowed the seller to return to the buyer many years after the sale, and many times, to demand extra payments. He also does not account for the inability of landlords to collect rent on second crops.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}}

However, [[Robert Brenner]] and Chris Isett emphasize differences in land tenancy rights.  They argue that in the lower Yangtze, most farmers either owned land or held secure tenancy at fixed rates of rent, so that neither farmers nor landlords were exposed to competition. In 15th century England, lords had lost their serfs, but were able to assert control over almost all of the land, creating a rental market for tenant farmers.  This created competitive pressures against subdividing plots, and the fact that plots could not be directly passed on to sons forced them to delay marriage until they had accumulated their own possessions.  Thus in England both agricultural productivity and population growth were subject to market pressures throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Brenner|Isett|2002}}

A 2017 study found that secure property rights in Europe, but not in large parts of the Middle-East, contributed to the increase of expensive labour-saving capital goods, such as water-mills, windmills, and cranes, in medieval Europe but its decrease in the Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Bavel|first=Bas|last2=Buringh|first2=Eltjo|last3=Dijkman|first3=Jessica|title=Mills, cranes, and the great divergence: the use of immovable capital goods in western Europe and the Middle East, ninth to sixteenth centuries|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/ehr.12571|issn=1468-0289|volume=71|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World===
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|Distribution of [[colonial empire]]s by the end of the 18th century]]
A variety of theories posit Europe's unique relationship with the New World as a major cause of the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7&amp;nbsp;percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on pre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=190}} According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=264}} New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to {{convert|25|e6acre|km2}} of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=266}}

Chen (2012) also suggested that the New World as a necessary factor for industrialization, and trade as a supporting factor causing less developed areas to concentrate on agriculture supporting industrialized regions in Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}}

===High-level equilibrium trap===
The [[high-level equilibrium trap]] theory argues that China did not undergo an indigenous industrial revolution since its economy was in a stable equilibrium, where supply and demand for labor were equal, disincentivizing the development of labor-saving capital.

===Culture===
Rosenberg and Birdzell claims that the so-called "eastern culture" of "respect" and "unquestionable devotion" to the ruling dynasty was as a result of a culture where the control of the dynasty led to a "silent society" that "did not ask questions or experiment without the approval or order from the ruling class". On the other hand, they claimed that the West of the late medieval era did not have a central authority or absolute state, which allowed for a free flow of ideas (Rosenberg, Birdzell, 1986). This so-called "eastern culture" also supposedly showed a "dismissal of change" due to their "fear of failure" and disregard for the imitation of outside inventions and science; this was different from the "western culture" which they claimed to be willing to experiment and imitate others to benefit their society. They claimed that this was a culture where change was encouraged, and sense of anxiety and disregard for comfort led them to be more innovative. [[Max Weber]] argued in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the [[Protestant work ethic]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]])  influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In his book ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' he blames Chinese culture for the non-emergence of capitalism in China. Chen (2012) similarly claims that cultural differences were the most fundamental cause for the divergence, arguing that the [[Humanism]] of the [[Renaissance]] followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (including revolutionary changes in attitude towards religion) enabled a mercantile, innovative, individualistic, and capitalistic spirit. For [[Ming Dynasty]] China, he claims there existed repressive measures which stifled dissenting opinions and nonconformity. He claimed that [[Confucianism]] taught that disobedience to one's superiors was supposedly tantamount to "sin". In addition Chen claimed that merchants and artificers had less prestige than they did in Western Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}} [[Justin Yifu Lin]] has argued for the role of the [[imperial examination]] system in removing the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation.&lt;ref name=Lin2011&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, "Demystifying the Chinese Economy", 2011, Cambridge University Press, Preface xiv, http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many scholars who have studied Confucian teachings have criticized the claim that the philosophy promoted unquestionable loyalty to one's superiors and the state. The core of Confucian philosophy itself was already [[Humanism|Humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|Rationalistic]]; it "[does] not share a belief in divine law and [does] not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will."&lt;ref name="juergensmeyer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer |first= Mark |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location = |isbn = 978-0-19-518835-6 |page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the central teachings of Confucianism is that one should remonstrate with authority. Many Confucians throughout history disputed their superiors in order to not only prevent the superiors and the rulers from wrongdoing, but also to maintain the independent spirits of the Confucians.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Xu Fuguan 徐復觀, ''Xueshu yu Zhengzhi zhi jian'' 學術與政治之間. (Taibei: Taiwan Xuesheng Shuju, 1980), 101–126, 331–395, 497–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the merchant class of China throughout all of Chinese history were usually wealthy and held considerable influence above their supposed social standing.&lt;ref name=Gernet /&gt; Historians like Yu Yingshi and Billy So have shown that as Chinese society became increasingly commercialized from the [[Song dynasty]] onward, Confucianism had gradually begun to accept and even support business and trade as legitimate and viable professions, as long as merchants stayed away from unethical actions. Merchants in the meantime had also benefited from and utilized Confucian ethics in their business practices. By the Song period, the [[Scholar-officials]] themselves were using intermediary agents to participate in trading.&lt;ref name=Gernet&gt;Gernet, Jacques (1962). ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright. Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}} pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
This is true especially in the [[Ming]]-[[Qing]] dynasties, when the social status of merchants had rose to such significance&lt;ref&gt;Yu Yingshi 余英時, ''Zhongguo Jinshi Zongjiao Lunli yu Shangren Jingshen'' 中國近世宗教倫理與商人精神. (Taibei: Lianjing Chuban Shiye Gongsi, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy So, ''Prosperity, Region, and Institutions in Maritime China.'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), 253–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy So, “Institutions in market economies of premodern maritime China.” In Billy So ed., ''The Economy of Lower Yangzi Delta in Late Imperial China.'' (New York: Routledge, 2013), 208–232.&lt;/ref&gt; that by the late Ming period, many scholar-officials were unabashed to declare publicly in their official family histories that they had family members who were merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-22154-0}} p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, while Confucianism did not actively promote profit seeking, it did not hinder China’s commercial development either.

Of the developed cores of the [[Old world]], India was distinguished by its [[Caste system in India|caste system]] of bound labor, which hampered economic and population growth and resulted in relative underdevelopment compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their [[Unfree labour|unfree laborers]] harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit and the development of markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India was not a very likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=212–214}}

Aspects of [[Islamic law]] have been proposed as an argument for the divergence for the [[Muslim world]]. Economist [[Timur Kuran]] argues that Islamic institutions which had at earlier stages promoted development later started preventing more advanced development by hampering formation of corporations, capital accumulation, mass production, and impersonal transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran, ''The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East'', 2010, Princeton University Press, http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9273.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar arguments proposed include the gradual prohibition of independent religious judgements ([[Ijtihad]]) and a strong [[communalism]] which limited contacts with outside groups and the development of institutions dealing with more temporary interactions of various kinds, according to Kuran.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft Vol. 153, No. 1, The New Institutional Economics Religion and Economics (March 1997), pp. 41–71 Published by: Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752985&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Donald Quataert]], however, the Ottoman Middle East's manufacturing sector was highly productive and evolving in the 19th century. Quataert criticizes arguments rooted in [[Orientalism]], such as "now-discredited [[stereotype]]s concerning the inferiority of [[Islam]]", economic institutions having stopped evolving after the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and decline of Ijtihad in religion negatively affecting economic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–8|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] noted that [[Ottoman law]] promoted [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[free trade]] earlier than Britain and the United States, arguing that free trade had a negative economic impact on the Ottoman Empire and contributed to its deindustrialization, in contrast to the more [[protectionist]] policies of Britain and the United States in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="bairoch31"/&gt;

In his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] argues that the human psychological traits (such as literacy, numeracy, and delayed gratification) needed for the divergence spread in England between 1200 and 1800 "at least culturally and perhaps also genetically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Farewell to Alms | first = Gregory | last = Clark | author-link = Gregory Clark (economist) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-691-12135-2 | pages = 8, 11, 120, 165, 271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shorter online version of Clark's work can be found here:  http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Capitalism%20Genes.pdf

===Political fragmentation===
Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China. China had both a printing press and movable type, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

Economic historian Tuan-Hwee Sng has argued that the large size of the Chinese state contributed to its relative decline in the 19th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sng|first=Tuan-Hwee|date=2014-10-01|title=Size and dynastic decline: The principal-agent problem in late imperial China, 1700–1850|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498314000205|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=54|pages=107–127|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast size of the Chinese empire created a severe principal-agent problem and constrained how the country was governed. In particular, taxes had to be kept low due to the emperor's weak oversight of his agents and the need to keep corruption in check. The Chinese state's fiscal weaknesses were long masked by its huge tax base. However, economic and demographic expansion in the eighteenth century exacerbated the problems of administrative control. This put a further squeeze on the nation's finances and left China ill-prepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One reason why Japan was able to modernize and adopt the technologies of the West was due to its much smaller size relative to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|last2=Moriguchi|first2=Chiaki|last3=Sng|first3=Tuan-Hwee|date=2015-10-28|title=Geopolitics and Asia's Little Divergence: A Comparative Analysis of State Building in China and Japan after 1850|ssrn=2682702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jeffrey G. Williamson]] has argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]], with [[British India|British rule]] later causing further deindustrialization.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior [[Industrial Revolution|factory technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and Poverty: When the Third World Fell Behind|author=[[Jeffrey G. Williamson]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2011|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiDslL0o-hUC&amp;pg=PA91|isbn=9780262295185}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Indian textiles still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Economic historian Prasannan Parthasarathi, however, has argued that there wasn't any such economic decline for several post-Mughal states, notably [[Bengal Subah]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], which were comparable to Britain in the late 18th century, until British colonial policies caused deindustrialization.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}

Stanford political scientist Gary W. Cox argues in a 2017 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Gary W.|date=2017|title=Political Institutions, Economic Liberty, and the Great Divergence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/political-institutions-economic-liberty-and-the-great-divergence/BF095246D91A9729C1A575B9A6706C95|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=77|issue=3|pages=724–755|doi=10.1017/S0022050717000729|issn=0022-0507|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her institutional innovations to foster substantial areas of “economic liberty,” where European merchants could organize production freer of central regulation, faced fewer central restrictions on their shipping and pricing decisions, and paid lower tariffs and tolls than their counterparts elsewhere in Eurasia. When fragmentation afforded merchants multiple politically independent routes on which to ship their goods, European rulers refrained from imposing onerous regulations and levying arbitrary tolls, lest they lose mercantile traffic to competing realms. Fragmented control of trade routes magnified the spillover effects of political reforms. If parliament curbed arbitrary regulations and tolls in one realm, then neighboring rulers might have to respond in kind, even if they themselves remained without a parliament. Greater economic liberty, fostered by the interaction of fragmentation and reform, unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth. &lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Justin Yifu Lin]] argued that China's large population size proved beneficial in technological advancements prior to the 14th century, but that the large population size was not an important factor in the kind of technological advancements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=1995-01-01|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early technological advancements depended on "learning by doing" (where population size was an important factor, as advances could spread over a large political unit), whereas the Industrial Revolution was the result of experimentation and theory (where population size is less important.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Representative government===
A number of economists have argued that representative government was a factor in the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The argue that absolutist governments, where rulers are not broadly accountable, are bad for property rights and innovation, and that they are prone to corruption and rent-seeking.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Long|first=J.

===Globalization===
A 2017 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that "globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850-1900."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luigi|first=Pascali|date=|title=The Wind of Change: Maritime Technology, Trade, and Economic Development|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|issn=0002-8282|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ehsthelongrun.net/2017/08/24/globalisation-and-economic-development-a-lesson-from-history/|title=Globalisation and Economic Development: A Lesson from History|last=ehs1926|date=2017-08-24|website=The Long Run|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states that benefited from globalization were "characterised by strong constraints on executive power, a distinct feature of the institutional environment that has been demonstrated to favour private investment."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Chance===
A number of economic historians have posited that the Industrial Revolution may have partly occurred where and when it did due to luck and chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Zilibotti|first2=Fabrizio|date=1997-08-01|title=Was Prometheus Unbound by Chance?

==Economic effects==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world]]

The Old World methods of agriculture and production could only sustain certain lifestyles. Industrialization dramatically changed the European economy and allowed it to attain much higher levels of wealth and productivity than the other Old World cores. Although Western technology later spread to the East, differences in uses preserved the Western lead and accelerated the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Productivity===

When analyzing comparative use-efficiency, the economic concept of [[total factor productivity]] (TFP) is applied to quantify differences between countries.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  TFP analysis controls for differences in energy and raw material inputs across countries and is then used to calculate [[productivity]]. The difference in productivity levels, therefore, reflects efficiency of energy and raw materials use rather than the raw materials themselves.{{sfn|Comin|2008}}  TFP analysis has shown that Western countries had higher TFP levels on average in the 19th century than Eastern countries such as [[India]] or [[China]], showing that Western productivity had surpassed the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Per capita income===
Some of the most striking evidence for the Great Divergence comes from data on [[per capita income]].{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  The West's rise to power directly coincides with per capita income in the West surpassing that in the East.  This change can be attributed largely to the mass transit technologies, such as [[railroads]] and [[steamboats]], that the West developed in the 19th century.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} The construction of large ships, trains, and railroads greatly increased productivity. These modes of transport made moving large quantities of coal, corn, grain, livestock and other goods across countries more efficient, greatly reducing transportation costs. These differences allowed Western productivity to exceed that of other regions.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] has estimated the GDP per capita of several major countries in 1960 US dollars after the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1976}}, p. 286, table 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biaroch European GDP per capita 1830-1890.svg|center]]

His estimates show that the GDP per capita of Western European countries rose rapidly after industrialization.

For the 18th century, and in comparison to non-European regions, Bairoch in 1995 stated that, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"&gt;Chris Jochnick, Fraser A. Preston (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpqmITSjgWAC&amp;pg=PA86 ''Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis'', pages 86-87], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{details|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Before and during the early 19th century, much of continental European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This left Europe with abundant idle natural resources. [[England]], on the other hand, had reached the limit of its agricultural productivity well before the beginning of the 19th century.  Rather than taking the costly route of improving soil fertility, the English increased labor productivity by industrializing agriculture.  From 1750 to 1850, European nations experienced population booms; however,  European agriculture was barely able to keep pace with the dietary needs. Imports from the Americas, and the reduced caloric intake required by [[proletariat|industrial workers]] compared to farmers allowed England to cope with the food shortages.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=215–219}} By the turn of the 19th century, much European farmland had been eroded and depleted of nutrients.  Fortunately, through improved farming techniques, the import of [[fertilizers]], and [[reforestation]], Europeans were able to recondition their soil and prevent food shortages from hampering industrialization. Meanwhile, many other formerly [[hegemonic]] areas of the world were struggling to feed themselves&amp;nbsp;– notably China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=223–225}}

===Fuel and resources===
The global demand for wood, a major resource required for industrial growth and development, was increasing in the first half of the 19th century.  A lack of interest of [[silviculture]] in Western Europe, and a lack of forested land, caused wood shortages.  By the mid-19th century, forests accounted for less than 15% of land use in most Western European countries. Fuel costs rose sharply in these countries throughout the 18th century and many households and factories were forced to ration their usage, and eventually adopt forest conservation policies.  It was not until the 19th century that [[coal]] began providing much needed relief to the European energy shortage.  China had not begun to use coal on a large scale until around 1900, giving Europe a huge lead on modern energy production.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=219–225}}

Through the 19th century, Europe had vast amounts of unused [[arable land]] with adequate water sources. However, this was not the case in China; most idle lands suffered from a lack of water supply, so forests had to be cultivated.  Since the mid-19th century, northern China's water supplies have been declining, reducing its agricultural output.  By growing [[cotton]] for [[textiles]], rather than importing, China exacerbated its water shortage.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=230–238}}
During the 19th century, supplies of wood and land decreased considerably, greatly slowing growth of Chinese per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=228–219}}

===Trade===
[[File:Triangular trade.svg|thumb|right|18th century triangular trade between Europe, the New World, and Africa.]]

During the era of European imperialism, [[periphery countries]] were often set up as specialized producers of specific resources. Although these specializations brought the periphery countries temporary economic benefit, the overall effect inhibited the industrial development of periphery territories.  Cheaper resources for [[core countries]] through trade deals with specialized periphery countries allowed the core countries to advance at a much greater pace, both economically and industrially, than the rest of the world.{{sfn|Williamson|2008}}

Europe's access to a larger quantity of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it a distinct advantage through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their [[colonies]], including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought a distinct advantage to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialize]], they would turn to [[import substitution]], depriving the hegemonic nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, they were able to prevent this from happening.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=242–243}} Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from [[India]]. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=128, 226–227, 244}} The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=252–258}}

Western Europe was also able to establish profitable trade with Eastern Europe. Countries such as [[Prussia]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Poland]] had very little freedom in comparison to the West;{{vague|date=November 2010}} forced labor left much of Eastern Europe with little time to work towards proto-industrialization and ample manpower to generate raw materials.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=257–258}}

===Guilds and journeymanship===
A 2017 study in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' argued, "medieval European institutions such as guilds, and specific features such as journeymanship, can explain the rise of Europe relative to regions that relied on the transmission of knowledge within closed kinship systems (extended families or clans)".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Croix|first=David|last2=Doepke|first2=Matthias|last3=Mokyr|first3=Joel|title=Clans, Guilds, and Markets: Apprenticeship Institutions and Growth in the Pre-Industrial Economy|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|doi=10.1093/qje/qjx026|volume=133|year=2017|pages=1–70|hdl=2078.1/172953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds and journeymanship were superior for creating and disseminating knowledge, which contributed to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">The '''Göttingen school of history''' was a group of historians associated with a particular style of historiography located at the [[University of Göttingen]] in the late [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gierl|first=Martin|title=Scholars in Action (2 vols): The Practice of Knowledge and the Figure of the Savant in the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtV2nJcVolQC&amp;pg=PA285|date=3 May 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-24391-7|page=285|chapter=Change of Paradigm as a Squabble between Institutions|quote=The term “Gottingen school of history" refers not to student-teacher relations nor to a shared methodology, but precisely to this field of competition in historical, cultural and anthropological interpretation, which emerged in Gottingen in the second half of the eighteenth century as an institutional effect of the Gottingen university, and which is captivating not for its shared attitude, but for its vigorous activity emanating from all of the university’s areas of expertise in all areas of contemporary cultural-historical debate - which, as a political and cultural identity debate, was at the centre of discourse in the late Enlightenment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of historians played an important role in creating a "scientific" basis for historical research,&lt;ref name="Cheng2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheng|first=Eileen K.|title=The Plain and Noble Garb of Truth: Nationalism &amp; Impartiality in American Historical Writing, 1784-1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-dg5Zh8n4wC&amp;pg=PA362|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3073-0|pages=362–|quote=…historians of the Gottingen school also played an important role in establishing the basis for critical scholarship and a more “scientific” approach to history during the second half of the eighteenth century as they used their training in philology and statistics and in what were considered the “auxiliary sciences" of paleography and numismatics to analyze historical data.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also responsible for coining two fundamental groups of terminologies in [[scientific racism]]:
*Blumenbach and Meiners's [[color terminology for race]]: [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] or white race; [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] or yellow race; [[Malay race|Malayan]] or brown race; [[Negroid race|Ethiopian]] or black race; and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]] or red race;&lt;ref&gt;''The End of Racism'' by Dinesh D'Souza, pg 124, 1995, "Blumenbach's classification had a lasting influence in part because his categories neatly broke down into familiar tones and colors: white, black, yellow, red, and brown."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gatterer, Schlözer and Eichhorn's [[Generations of Noah|Biblical terminology for race]]: [[Semitic people|Semitic]], [[Hamitic]] and [[Japhetic]].

The University of Göttingen was the original centre of the "[[:de:Geschichtswissenschaft|Geschichtswissenschaft]]" or history as an academic discipline, and became a major centre for globally-orientated anthropology.&lt;ref name="Burns2006"/&gt; The school itself was one of the newest universities in Europe, having been founded in 1734 by [[:de:Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen|Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen]], and the first to require the obligation to conduct and publish research alongside lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demel|first=Walter|title=Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Western and Eastern Constructions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTMyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23741-4|pages=68–|quote=In order to explain this concept and its changes, one must consider the intellectual situation of Göttingen. A university had been founded in this Lower Saxony town in 1736-37. Here, for the first time. the task of giving lectures was combined with the obligation to conduct and publish research. Göttingen soon became known as a center of “universal” historiography which - under English influence - flourished there… Being a center of global history, Göttingen became a hub for globally oriented anthropology as well. Or, to express it with a slight exaggeration: It became what would be called in German the most important ‘’Hexenküche’’ [witch’s kitchen] of racial theories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historians of this school sought to write a [[universal history]] by combining the critical methods of [[Jean Mabillon]] with that of the philosophical historians such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Edward Gibbon]].&lt;ref name="Ranke2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iggers|first=Georg|title=The Theory and Practice of History: Edited with an Introduction by Georg G.

Niebuhr and Ranke refined the concern with critical method, Ranke in the process narrowed the universality of the outlook of the Gottingen historians. What Ranke brought to history was less a new method - this had been developed to a great extent by the Gottingen school - than a greater emphasis on the professional and technical character of history and a conception of history that we shall discuss later in this Introduction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of first humans to populate the southern continent remains a matter of conjecture and debate. Some anthropologist believe they could have arrived as a result of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|earliest human migrations out of Africa]]. Although they likely migrated to the territory, later named Australia, though [[Southeast Asia]] they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or [[Polynesia]]n population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the [[Austronesian people]]s of modern-day [[New Guinea]] and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]]. (1997). ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. Random House. London. pp 314–316&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of first European contact, it is generally estimated that between 315,000 to 750,000 people lived in Australia, in [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|diverse groups]], but upper estimates place the total population as high as 1.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Queensland |last= Evans |first= R. |year= 2007 |publisher= Cambridge U. Press |location= Cambridge UK |isbn= 978-0-521-54539-6 |pages= 10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cumulative population of 1.6 billion people has been estimated to have lived in Australia over 65,000 years prior to [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British colonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor=Gordon Briscoe |editor2= Len Smith |year =2002|chapter=2. How many people had lived in Australia before it was annexed by the English in 1788? |title= The Aboriginal Population Revisited: 70,000 years to the present|publisher = Canberra, Aboriginal Studies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regions of heaviest Indigenous population were the same temperate coastal regions that are currently the most heavily populated. In the early [[History of Australia (1901–45)|1900s]] it was commonly believed that the Aboriginal population of Australia was leading toward [[extinct]]ion. The population shrank from those present when colonisation occurred in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930; this was primarily due to an outbreak of [[smallpox]] and to a lesser extent from other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hopkins, ''Princes and Peasants'', Chicago, 1983, p. 207; Judy Campbell, ''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780–1880'', Melbourne, 2002, pp. 10, 39–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smallpox Through History"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Smallpox Through History |url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKpBPdn?url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-colonisation, the coastal Indigenous populations were soon absorbed, depleted or forced from their lands; the traditional aspects of Aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the [[Great Sandy Desert]] where European settlement has been sparse. The greatest [[population density]] was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the [[Murray River]] valley in particular. However, Aboriginal Australians maintained successful communities throughout Australia, from the cold and wet highlands of [[Tasmania]] to the more [[deserts of Australia|arid parts of the continental interior]]. Technologies, diets and hunting practices varied according to the local environment.

[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|300px|The [[Sunda Shelf]] and [[Sahul Shelf]].]]

It is believed that the first [[early human migration]] to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the [[Sahul continent]], connected to the island of New Guinea via a [[land bridge]]. It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between [[Sulawesi]] and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via [[Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;Lourandos, H., ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The most generally accepted date for first arrival is between 40,000–80,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. Near [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] in [[New South Wales]], since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools have been found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP.  When these results were new they were controversial, but more recent dating of the same strata in 1987 and 2003 has corroborated these dates.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | authorlink = Val Attenbrow| year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152–153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 Nov 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockton-Nanson-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Stockton | first1= Eugene D. | last2= Nanson | first2= Gerald C. |date=April 2004 | title= Cranebrook Terrace Revisited | journal= [[Archaeology in Oceania]] | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 59–60 | jstor=40387277  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 48,000 BCE date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using [[thermoluminescence]].

A large number of sites have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to around 38,000 BCE, leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique. Radiocarbon dating is limited to a maximum age of around 40,000 years.

Humans reached [[Tasmania]] approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the [[last glacial maximum]].

[[Mungo Man]], whose remains were discovered in 1974 near [[Lake Mungo]] in New South Wales, is the oldest human yet found in Australia. Although the exact age of Mungo Man is in [[Australian archaeology#Lake Mungo dating|dispute]], the best consensus is that he is at least 40,000 years old. Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated, based on [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic association]], to be about 50,000 years old. Since Lake Mungo is in south-eastern Australia, many [[archaeologist]]s have concluded that humans must have arrived in north-west Australia at least several thousand years earlier.

In 2012, the results of large-scale [[Human genome|genotyping]] has indicated that Aboriginal Australians, the [[Papuan people|indigenous peoples of New Guinea]] and the [[Lumad peoples#Mamanwa|Mamanwa]], an indigenous people of the southern [[Philippines]] are closely related, having diverged from a common origin approximately 36,000 years ago. The same studies show that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11% Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia, indicating a substantial gene flow between [[Indian people|Indian populations]] and Northern Australia occurred around 4,230 years ago. Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time, suggesting there may have been migration from [[India]].&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Irina Pugach |author2=Frederick Delfin |author3=Ellen Gunnarsdóttir |author4=Manfred Kayser |author5=Mark Stoneking |title=Genome-wide data substantiate Holocene gene flow from India to Australia |date=14 January 2013 |journal=PNAS |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=1803–1808 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1211927110 |pmid=23319617 |pmc=3562786|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1803P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm Aboriginal genes suggest Indian migration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820123208/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm |date=20 August 2013 }} [[Australian Geographic]] 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago, as sea levels were rising, showing some of the human archaeological sites]]
When the north-west of Australia, which is closest to Asia, was first occupied, the region consisted of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|open tropical forests]] and [[woodland]]s. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, by which time the Aboriginal people had settled the entire continent, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice age. By the [[Last Glacial Maximum#Australasia|glacial maximum]], 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to around 140 metres below its present level. Australia was connected to New Guinea and the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]] was separated from [[Southeast Asia]] (''[[Wallacea]]'') by a [[strait]] only approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name="Coukell"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Coukell | first =  Allan | year =  May 2001 | title =  Could mysterious figures lurking in Australian rock art be the world's oldest shamans? |magazine=  [[New Scientist]] | volume =  | issue =  |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall was 40% to 50% lower than modern levels, depending on region, while the lower [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;J.G.

The Kimberley, including the adjacent exposed continental [[Sahul Shelf]], was covered by vast grasslands dominated by flowering plants of the family [[Poaceae]], with woodlands and semi-arid scrub covering the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia.&lt;ref name="ENSO"&gt;McGowan H, Marx S, Moss P, Hammond A. Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia.

It is believed that during this period no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah, while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of Queensland.

Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time, and there would seem to have been scattered [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|"refugia"]] in which the modern vegetation types and Aboriginal populations were able to survive. Corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact, and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called "[[Songlines]]" today.&lt;ref name="dodson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dodson | first = J.R. | year = September 2001 | title = Holocene vegetation change in the mediterranean-type climate regions of Australia | journal = The Holocene | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 673–680 | doi=10.1191/09596830195690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Adams [http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html Australasia during The Last 150,000 Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226170218/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAUSTRALASIA.html |date=26 February 2013 }}  Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.H.Monroe  [http://austhrutime.com/glacial_maximum_australia.htm Last Glacial Maximum in Australia] Australia: The Land Where Time Began: A biography of the Australian continent&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the ice age, strong rains returned, until around 5,500 years ago, when the wet season cycle in the north ended, bringing with it a megadrought that lasted 1,500 years.

Following the Ice Age, Aboriginal people around the coast, from [[Arnhem Land]], the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] and the southwest of Western Australia, all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the Ice Age. It was this event that isolated the Tasmanian Aboriginal people on their island, and probably led to the extinction of Aboriginal cultures on the [[Bass Strait]] Islands and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.&lt;ref name="Flood, Josephine 1994"/&gt;  In the interior, the end of the Ice Age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semi-desert areas by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving [[circumcision]]. There has been a long history of contact between [[Papuans|Papuan]] peoples of the [[Papua New Guinea|Western Province]], [[Torres Strait Islanders]] and the Aboriginal people in [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Josephine 1994"&gt;Flood, Josephine (1994), "Archaeology of the Dreamtime" (Angus &amp; Robertson; 2Rev Ed)({{ISBN|0-207-18448-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal Australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment. There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment. One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the [[marsupial]] [[megafauna]] (also see [[Australian megafauna]]). Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna. Others claim that, because the megafauna were large and slow, they were easy prey for human hunters. A third possibility is that human modification of the environment, particularly through the use of fire, indirectly led to their extinction. Oral history demonstrates "the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians" for at least 10,000 years. This is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean [[shoreline]]s; oral records of megafauna; and comets.&lt;ref name=ABC201411&gt;{{cite web

At left, a spear-thrower (called [[woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] in the [[Eora]] language), and two examples of boomerangs. Boomerangs could be used for hunting (most were non-returning), or purely for music and ceremony.]]
The introduction of the dingo, possibly as early as 3500 BCE, showed that contact with South East Asian peoples continued, as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of Thailand.  This contact was not just one-way, as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates. Dingoes began and evolved in Asia. The earliest known dingo-like fossils are from Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand (dated at 5500 years BP) and from north Vietnam (5000 years BP). According to skull morphology, these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves (prime candidates were the pale footed (or Indian) wolf ''Canis lupus pallipes'' and the Arabian wolf ''Canis lupus arabs'') and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Laurie (1995), "The Dingo: in Australia and Asia"&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of [[fire-stick farming]] that was responsible for these extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim "The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People" (Grove Press)({{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for "at least 17,000 years". Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes: to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey; to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires; to make travel easier; to eliminate pests; for ceremonial purposes; for warfare and just to "clean up country." There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which this burning led to large-scale changes in vegetation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/aboriginal-australians-co-existed-with-the-megafauna-for-at-least-17-000-years-70589|last1=Westaway|first1=Michael|last2=Olley|first2=Jon|last3=Grun|first3=Rainer|title=Aboriginal Australians co-existed with the megafauna for at least 17,000 years|work=The Conversation|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
[[File:Aboriginal grinding stones.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Aboriginal grinding stones - a pestle and mortar - vital in making flours for [[bush bread]]. Aboriginal women were expert at making bread from a variety of seasonal grains and nuts.]]
Aboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, [[boomerang]], or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent [[Aboriginal tracker|trackers]] and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell.

Fish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. The mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region. While Torres Strait Island populations were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods, most Aboriginal Australians were [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights.
[[File:Aboriginal craft made from weaving grass.jpg|thumb|220px|Aboriginal women's implements, including a [[coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] lined with [[paperbark]] and a digging stick. This woven basket style is from Northern Australia. Baskets were used for collecting fruits, corms, seeds and even water – some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight.]]
In present-day [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]] in the territory of the [[Djab Wurrung]], which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see [[Gunditjmara]]). A primary tool used in hunting is the [[spear]], launched by a [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a [[Throwing Stick]]), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.

On mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo was [[domestication|domesticated]], however domestic pigs were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders. The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, [[kangaroo]], [[emu]], [[wombat]]s, [[goanna]], snakes, birds, many insects such as [[honeypot ant|honey ants]], [[Bogong moth]]s and [[witchetty grub]]s. Many varieties of plant foods such as [[taro]], [[coconut]]s, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.

===Culture===
[[File:Lomandra textiles.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Lomandra'', a plant used by Aboriginal Australians for weaving]]
Permanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were [[semi-nomadic]], moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following [[seasonal food]] sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of [[midden]]s, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. [[Rock painting]] at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent [[Sydney rock engravings|rock paintings found in the Sydney basin]] area which date to around 5,000 years.

[[Harry Lourandos]] has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in [[stone tool]] technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo.

Many Indigenous communities also have a very complex [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship]] structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]]. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as [[corroboree]]s) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented [[inbreeding]] in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups.

==Impact of British colonisation==

===1788–1900, European settlement===
[[File:Native Encampment by Skinner Prout, from Australia (1876, vol II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|right|A 19th-century engraving of an Aboriginal Australian encampment, showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of Australia at the time of European settlement.]]
In 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast of Australia in the name of the [[United Kingdom]] and named it New South Wales. Cook's declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the  inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788. The most immediate consequence of British settlement – within weeks of the first colonists' arrival – was a wave of European epidemic diseases such as [[chickenpox]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]] and [[measles]], which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline.

The second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought [[venereal disease]], to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and [[substance abuse]] has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since.  Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers arrived or recorded their existence.

====Diseases====
Deadly [[Infectious disease#Historic pandemics|infectious diseases]] like smallpox, influenza and [[tuberculosis]] were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html Invisible Invaders]&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population.&lt;ref name="Smallpox Through History"/&gt; In 1789, a disastrous smallpox epidemic broke out, killing up to 70% of the Indigenous people of the Sydney region. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the [[First Fleet]], it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive [[hunters and gatherers]] dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve.

Lieutenant [[William Bradley (New South Wales colonial politician)|William Bradley]] recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White who believed they were suffering from "slight inflammatory complaints".&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with Sixty-five Plates of Non Descript Animals, Birds, Lizards, Serpents, Curious Cones of Trees and Other Natural Productions'', London, 1795, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the smallpox epidemic is controversial, and it has been speculated that the surgeons on board the First Fleet brought vials of smallpox matter and either accidentally or intentionally released it as a "[[biological weapon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |title=The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789 |journal=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society |author=Mear, Craig |accessdate=11 May 2013|date=June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, writing in ''Journal of Australian Studies'', Christopher Warren concluded that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox, possibly without informing Governor Phillip but conceded in his conclusion that "today's evidence only provides for a balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Smallpox at Sydney Cover - who, when and why?|last=Warren|first=Christopher|url=https://capitalaintnatural.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/smallpox-sydney-cove.pdf|journal=Journal of Australian Studies |volume=38 |issue=1|date=March 2014|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79,68–86}}

On the mainland, [[Australian Frontier Wars|prolonged conflict]] followed the frontier of European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairnsmuseum.org.au/aboriginal.htm "The War for the land: A Short History of Aboriginal-European relations in Cairns."]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote: "There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 1834.

Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the [[Noongar]] of south-western Australia, led by [[Yagan]], who was killed in 1833. The [[Kalkadoon]] of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at [[Coniston, Northern Territory|Coniston]] in the Northern Territory in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000 - 20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]]. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Windshuttle, The Fabrication of the Aboriginal Death Toll', in Quadrant, November 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 [[white people]] were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html The Statistics of Frontier Conflict]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.

The [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Palawa]], or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a [[genocide|genocidal policy]], in the form of the "[[Black War]]". Other historians dispute this. [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: "Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, Geoffrey : A Land Half Won, Macmillan, South Melbourne, Vic., 1980, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephine Flood]] wrote: "The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones."&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1741148725}}, p89&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803–47, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, Keith (2002). The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847. Sydney: Macleay Press. {{ISBN|1-876492-05-8}}, pp351-397&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, H. A. Willis, has subsequently disputed Windschuttle's figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 1803–34 alone, with possibly another 145 killed during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC&amp;dq Josephine Flood, 2006, ''The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People''], Allen &amp; Unwin, ({{ISBN|1-74114-872-3}}) p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, ''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed, but untrue, that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was [[Truganini]], who died in 1876. This belief stems from a distinction between "full bloods" and "[[half-caste|half castes]]" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s set up on the islands of Bass Strait.

Nevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the [[Guugu Yimithirr people|Guugu Yimithirr]] people who met James Cook near [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] in 1770. [[Bennelong]] served as [[interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]] between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as [[John King (explorer)|John King]], who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]], an escaped convict, who was with the [[Wautharong]] people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian [[cricket]] team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players.

====Agriculture====
As the European [[transhumance|pastoral]] industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood.

In south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the [[Australian goldrushes]]. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, [[rabbits in Australia|rabbits]] and [[cattle]], all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably [[pearl]]ing, also employed Aboriginal workers.

In many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources.

===1900–1940s===

In spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century. In [[World War I|1914]] around 800 Aboriginal people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2008/04/24/aboriginal-anzacs/ |title=Aboriginal ANZACS |publisher=Australian War Memorial |first=Robyn |last=Van Dyk |date=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; answered the call to arms, despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military. As the war continued, these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed. Many enlisted by claiming they were [[Māori people|Māori]] or [[Historical definitions of races in India|Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

By the 1920s, the Indigenous population had declined to between 50,000 and 90,000, and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held, even among Australians sympathetic to their situation. But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of [[penicillin]] to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline.

In the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the [[Caledon Bay crisis]], and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

In the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], the father of modern social anthropology, published his ''Social Organization of Australian Tribes'' in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Cowlishaw|chapter=Australian Aboriginal studies: The anthropologists' accounts|title=The Cultural Construction of Race|editor=M. de Lepervanche|editor2=G. Bottomley|publisher=Sydney Association for Studies in Society and Culture|year=1988|pages=60–79|chapter-url=http://openjournals.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/SSSC/article/viewFile/7340/7759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of World War II, many Indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary. However, Aboriginal workers remained [[unfree labour]]ers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, [[Jack Patten]] led a strike at [[Cummeragunja Mission]] in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meager rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]], and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koorihistory.com/jack-patten/ Koori History: Remembering Jack Patten&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1946, Aboriginal station workers in the [[Pilbara]] region of Western Australia started the [[1946 Pilbara strike]] and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal [[Pastoral Industry Award]] of 1968, which required the payment of a [[minimum wage]] to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became [[refugees]] or [[fringe dwellers]], living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities.

In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections.

All Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] government in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm Australian Electoral Commission - Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians]&lt;/ref&gt; The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in [[Australian federal election, 1963|November 1963]]. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965.

The [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referendums.

In 1971, [[Yolngu]] people at [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] sought an injunction against [[Nabalco]] to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial [[Gove land rights case]], Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been [[terra nullius]] before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the [[Yolngu]] people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|Woodward Commission]], and then to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act]].

In 1972, the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was established on the steps of [[Politics of Australia|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were "strangers in their own country". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site.

In 1975, the [[Whitlam]] government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissal of the Whitlam government]] by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]) was introduced by the coalition government led by [[Malcolm Fraser]]. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant "inalienable" freehold title to some traditional lands.

In 1984, [[Pintupi Nine|a group of Pintupi]] people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the [[Gibson Desert]] in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_1_no_2/exhibition_reviews/colliding_worlds/ Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932–1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 federal government report described the history of the "Aboriginal Homelands Movement" or "Return to Country movement" as "a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, reserves, missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country."&lt;ref name=RepsCountry&gt;{{cite web|title=RETURN TO COUNTRY THE ABORIGINAL HOMELANDS MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/reports/1987/1987_PP125A.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], declaring the previous legal concept of ''[[terra nullius]]'' to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise [[Native Title]] claims over land in Australia.

In 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see [[Stolen generation]]) from their families, a [[National Sorry Day]] was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]].

In 1999 a [[Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)|referendum]] was held to change the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic.

In 2004, the Australian Government abolished The [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, [[Geoff Clark (politician)|Geoff Clark]], as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been [[mainstream]]ed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The [[Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination]] was established within the then [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs]], and now with the [[Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] to coordinate a "whole of government" effort.

In June 2005, [[Richard Frankland]], founder of the '[[Your Voice]]' political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth-century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians "be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the [[Australian War Memorial]]". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, [[The Age]], said that "Frankland has raised an important question," and asked whether moving "work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history."

In 2008, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] made a formal [[Stolen generations#Australian federal parliament apology|apology for the Stolen Generations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8312">The '''history of mentalities''' is a [[calque]] of the [[French language|French]] term ''histoire des mentalités'', which might also be translated as "[[history]] of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s", "[[mindset]]s" or "[[world-view]]s". The term describes a particular manner of researching history. This approach is associated with the "critical turn" (''tournant critique'') taken by the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]], particularly around the 1960s.

In keeping with the ''Annales''' interest in the ''[[longue durée]]'' (long-term), the history of mentalities focuses on the mindsets of past cultural and social groups, and their gradual changes over time, as opposed to the history of particular events, or economic trends. The term can also be seen as an equivalent to, or a form of, [[cultural history]] or [[historical anthropology]]

== History ==

=== ''Annales'' ===
The history of mentalities, or ''histoire des mentalités'', is a term used to describe works of history aimed at describing and analyzing the ways in which people of a given time period thought about, interacted with, and classified the world around them. The history of mentalities has been used as a historical tool by several historians and scholars from various schools of history. Notably, the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]] helped to develop the history of mentalities and construct a methodology from which to operate. In establishing this methodology, they sought to limit their analysis to a particular place and a particular time.&lt;ref name=Duby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duby|first1=Georges|title=The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} This approach lends itself to the intensive study that characterizes microhistory, another field which adopted the history of mentalities as a tool of historical analysis.

The origin of the term history of mentalities lies in the writings of the ''Annales'' historians such as [[Georges Duby]] and [[Roger Chartier]]. In seeking to create works of total history, ''Annales'' historians tended not to simply rely on the political or event oriented history of past generations.&lt;ref name=Harsgor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harsgor|first1=Michael|title=Total History: The Annales School|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|date=January 1978|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Michael Harsgor points out in that the challenge of the ''Annales'' historians was not to create this deterministic history that appeared to rely heavily on teleological conclusions, such as the Marxist forms of history being written at the time. Rather, Harsgor writes that the ''Annales'' historians tasked themselves with the creation of social structures, "which means covering the skeleton of the basic economic analysis with the flesh of demographic, cultural, mental, and event psychoanalytical data."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|4}} It has also been said that ''Annales'' historians, in their attempts at the creation of total history, considered the history of mentalities a single aspect in the creation of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=Patrick|title=The History of Mentalities: The New Map of Cultural History|journal=History and Theory|date=October 1981|volume=20|issue=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they were attempting to reconstruct the world of whatever time period they were examining. In his works, such as ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'' and his work on William Marshal, Duby focused on the development of ideologies within the structures that permeated the various aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name=Duby/&gt;{{rp|9}}

=== Microhistory ===
This development in methodology would prove crucial for other historians who would use the history of mentalities to attempt to reconstruct the worldviews of individuals and extrapolate their findings to the population at large in the form of microhistories. These historians would largely concern themselves with social and cultural history in order to form their history of mentalities, narrowing their realm historical inquiry by not concerning themselves with the broad economic serialization that had become so important for the ''Annales'' historians.&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|2}} [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s book, ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'', is archetypical of the microhistories that emerged with the history of mentalities in mind. Ginzburg attempted to reconstruct peasant mentalities in sixteenth century Italy by examining the trial records of a single miller, Domenico Scandella, called [[Menocchio]], and trying to find currents or similarities in otherwise fragmentary and obscure evidence.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginzburg|first1=Carlo|title=The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

Similar techniques can be seen in [[Robert Darnton]]'s ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', which uses microhistory to establish the mentalities of groups at different social levels of French society. Darnton concerns himself greatly with the ways in which people viewed the world around them. He interprets the symbolic significance of journeymen printers massacring neighborhood cats as a display of frustration with the growing bourgeoisie class.&lt;ref name=Darnton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darnton|first1=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|date=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} Similarly, and in keeping with the tradition of the history of mentalities, Darnton devotes a chapter to an analysis of a bourgeoisie's description of his city, in an effort to determine how an individual in a given social situation would interpret and make sense of the world around them. Darnton uses this description to demonstrate that the ways in which events might be portrayed might be completely unsupported by the ways in which individuals of the time might have interpreted those events.&lt;ref name=Darnton/&gt;{{rp|116}}

== Criticism ==
Criticisms have emerged regarding the history of mentalities at all stages of its development. In particular, [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] were quick to criticize the ''Annales'' historians for "attempts to include the study of mentalities in a general synthesis, which can only lead to the publication of articles reflecting a basic reliance upon faith accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|7}} Carlo Ginzburg himself has criticized the methods of the history of mentalities for its "decidedly classless character."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg/&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28846">The '''Indigo Era''', or "Indigo economies", is a concept first publicized in early 2016 by international businessman [[Mikhail Fridman]], the co-founder of [[LetterOne]], an international investment business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/contributor/mikhail-fridman/ "Mikhail Fridman"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Retrieved 13 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe what he views as an emerging new era of economies and economics based on ideas, innovation, and creativity, which he sees as replacing economies which are based on the possession of [[natural resources]]. The word "indigo" was initially chosen based on the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.

He describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is "a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer [[resource rent]] but the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt; But, according to Fridman – based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns – it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough.

In late 2016 LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere [[GDP]] as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to "stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy."&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched/&gt;

==Indigo Era==
The economic term "Indigo Era" was publicized in early 2016 by [[Mikhail Fridman]], the co-founder of the international investment business [[LetterOne]].&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He used the term to describe the new economic era based on ideas, innovation, and creativity – which he theorizes is replacing the previous era which he sees as defined by the struggle for [[natural resources]] and land that contains them, and which is measured by [[GDP]]. The word "indigo" was adopted from the term [[indigo children]], which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities.&lt;ref name=realclear&gt;Fridman, Mikhail.

''[[Times of Israel]]''. 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' website adds that the indigo symbolism "embodies a breaking of the norm, something that is highly reflective of the new era that we are entering into, one that lacks convention and is driven by innovation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/symbolism-of-indigo/ "Symbolism of Indigo"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2016 article in ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', retitled and reprinted in May 2016 in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', and reprinted in November 2016 under the original title in LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal, Fridman wrote:

{{quote|We are entering a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity. A new generation of curious, strong-willed and talented individuals is unhindered by convention or the past. This new “Indigo” generation is now shaping tomorrow's economy and creating national wealth. I use the term Indigo because it has been used to refer to children with special or unusual abilities.

===Analysis===
In a series of articles published in 2016, Fridman cites the recent extreme volatility in markets,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; and worldwide political change and instability,&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; as signs of an emerging global shift.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya/mir/319431-pokolenie-indigo-vkhod-svobodnyi "Поколение индиго. Вход свободный"] (in Russian). ''[[Forbes]]''. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admission&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/the-indigo-generation-admission-free/ "The Indigo Generation. Admission Free"]. ABH Holdings. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; He notes two frequently cited prominent indicators of an economic shift: the sharp decline in prices of natural resources including oil, and the slowing of China's economic growth despite this decline in the cost of natural resources.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals&gt;Fridman, Mikhail. [http://abhh.lu/news-insights/fundamentals-of-a-strong-economy/ "Fundamentals of a strong economy"]. ABH Holdings. 30 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

He and other commentators also note the rise of populism and populist leaders and candidates, both right-wing and left-wing, as these changes occur.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;[[Stanley Greenberg|Greenberg, Stanley]]. [http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/we-need-a-new-progressive-era-of-renewal/ "We Need a New Progressive Era of Renewal"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Meanwhile, companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] – digital and technological companies he calls "Indigo companies" – have replaced longterm traditional natural-resource or manufacturing companies such as [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] as the world's largest companies.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;

Fridman observes that throughout history innovations, alternatives, and technologies have always overcome any perceived shortages of any natural resource.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt; He therefore posits that the new "Indigo era", fueled by digital and technological resources, will be marked by a shift away from the struggle for natural resources and their perceived scarcity, to a reliance on ideas, innovation, and creativity and on supporting the intellectual and creative potential of each human being:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; "The world has entered a new era where the source of a nation's wealth is no longer natural resources. Intellectual capacity has now replaced land, raw materials and trade routes as the biggest source of wealth."&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;

According to Fridman, three interconnected factors are needed for successful Indigo companies and an Indigo economy:&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;
*intuitive individual talent and a high level of education, plus the ability to form a team of equally educated and gifted people 
*a sophisticated and complex ecosystem, which includes not only legal systems that protect physical and intellectual property rights and protection from takeover by larger companies, but also  thousands of suppliers and subcontractors to supply high-quality services which range from venture capital to marketing to web design and other technologies and services
*a global digital infrastructure to distribute new products and accumulate customer data and customer-behavior insight

He notes that most emerging economies have focused on building physical structures (roads, buildings, cities, physical infrastructure) rather than the complex legal, political, and social systems, institutions, and changes that will support an effective free and innovative intellectual-resource economy.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; The freedoms, protections, and political and legal frameworks of developed Western countries rest on centuries-long histories, socio-political traditions, and mindsets, and therefore will be difficult to replicate quickly in emerging economies.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman singles out India as an emerging country that has adequate legal infrastructure and freedom to probably survive the Indigo shift.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

Fridman considers the growth of Indigo economies to be a paradigm shift; he states that the pace at which technology is developing is creating worldwide tectonic shifts, and predicts huge global change over the next five to ten years.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt; He and other analysts predict that the growing economic gap between free, creative economies and groups in contrast to repressive, authoritarian, totalitarian, or tradition-bound economies or groups will widen and create resentment and hostilities – whether this is between nations or within nations.&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/volume-one/editorial/ "Editorial"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Those left behind may be either emerging countries, or the average person – as opposed to the intellectual elites – within developed Western countries.&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

Authoritarian leaders and authoritarianism often rise during periods of uncertainty and insecurity and economic deprivation.&lt;ref name=fundamentals/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt; Fridman maintains however that in this ever-changing new economic era, the main source of wealth in a country or region will no longer be a natural resource, but a social infrastructure that will allow everyone to realise their intellectual and creative potential.&lt;ref name=kknews/&gt;&lt;ref name=forsal/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt; Therefore, he asserts that "The future Indigo economy is an economy of free people. And this means that the world will become more and more free."&lt;ref name=realclear/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=admission/&gt;&lt;ref name=milken/&gt;

In November 2016 [[LetterOne]] launched a journal, ''Global Perspectives'', as a platform to explore "the new emerging economic era, the Indigo era, from different perspectives, including education, religion, politics, economics, history and business" and to examine "global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letterone.com/insight/the-global-perspectives-journal "The Global Perspectives Journal examines global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world"].

==Indigo Index and Indigo Score==
The November 2016 inaugural issue of ''Global Perspectives'' also published an Indigo Index,&lt;ref name=score&gt;[http://global-perspectives.org.uk/indigo-score/ "Indigo Score"]. ''Global Perspectives''. Volume 1. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/news_2016_en.html "''Global Perspectives'' publishes the Indigo Score"]. [[European Commission]]. 1 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which rated 152 countries based on five key metrics for doing business as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by creativity and digital skills.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; The five metrics are: creativity and innovation, economic diversity, digital economy, freedom, and stability and legal frameworks,&lt;ref&gt;Washtell, Francesca.

==Indigo Prize==
In July 2017, LetterOne's ''Global Perspectives'' journal announced the Indigo Prize, to stimulate discussion towards finding a new way of measuring the economy in the 21st century that moves beyond the limitations of mere GDP measurements.&lt;ref name=competitionlaunched&gt;[http://www.letterone.com/media/news/2017/major-new-economics-competition-launched-100000-indigo-prize "Major new economics competition launched - £100,000 Indigo Prize"].

The '''International Society for the Study of Medievalism''' is an academic organization that exists to promote the interdisciplinary study of the popular and scholarly reception of the Middle Ages in postmedieval times. The society is based on the work and studies of [[Leslie J. Workman]] (1927–2001), who is recognized as the founder of the academic study of [[medievalism]] in the English-speaking world. The work of the society is characterized as open to innovative and inclusive interdisciplinary scholarship. As Elena Levy-Navarro writes: "The Society has not restricted itself to a single definition of medievalism, and has, both by its calls for papers and by its acceptance and inclusion, encouraged academics to explore medievalism in such disparate phenomenon as the 'Celtic' tattoo, medieval gaming, and the early modern. Such an expansiveness that resists firm boundaries, and thus resists any efforts to develop a concrete field of specialty over which the academic can preside as expert is evident to the continued commitment of its members to electronic media that can provide (for those who can afford it) open access to its collective work, including its journal, ''Year’s Work in Medievalism'', and its community-authored blog, ''Medievally Speaking''. One need only consider the subtitle of this blog—'An Open Access Review Journal Encouraging Critical Engagement with the Continuing Process of Inventing the Middle Ages' (emphasis mine)—to see that the members insist on an openness, in which they critically engage—but not adjudicate—the 'continuing process of inventing the Middle Ages.'"&lt;ref&gt;Elena Levy-Navarro: "A Long Parenthesis Begins," in ''[https://79a68520-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/theyearsworkinmedievalism/cabinet/28%20Levy_Navarro.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coILs-QnSk6ptE8noLqoWu6ykfx6S20sZeKiF8XFjfjCTZGy3LTmsUq6RvkieBM6qhzlyvZPA78z5gWA7-yDdmygRpV26-cuFIAx74UuZ8RJj_8oE7LkE19Rd29-NLRNNSFpLiBIOpgl4Qs9eLXhs-8GeLAp3rmZyHSBY-yJUfxALQaA-UXjNvEktaJW1vQQBqKPP1oiVi0sjBcBAREdQG8_-hvK9f84xZDW75Mrjvas2a7pcTKqofjvGahP9MWZIYFhAMj&amp;attredirects=0 Medievalism Now]'', ed. by E. L. Risden, Karl Fugelso, and Richard Utz (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the ISSM's president, Richard Utz, published a short monograph, ''Medievalism: A Manifesto'', that embedded the subject of medievalism studies within the larger academic contexts of reception studies, feminism, gender studies, and medieval studies.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, Richard ''Medievalism: A Manifesto'' (Bradford, UK; Kalamazoo, MI: ARC Humanities Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society maintains a peer-reviewed journal, ''Studies in Medievalism'', an online journal for shorter articles (''[https://sites.google.com/site/theyearsworkinmedievalism/home The Year's Work in Medievalism]''), and a review journal, ''Medievally Speaking'' edited by [[Richard Utz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medievallyspeaking.blogspot.com/ |title=medievally speaking – medievalism in review |publisher=medievallyspeaking.blogspot.com |accessdate=2011-10-24 |last=Utz|first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also organize annual conference sessions at the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]] at [[Western Michigan University]] and the [[International Medieval Congress]] at the [[University of Leeds]], and hold their own Annual International Conferences on Medievalism at institutions of higher education worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medievalism.net/conferences.html |title=International Conference on Medievalism |publisher=International Society for the Study of Medievalism |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Studies in Medievalism''==
''Studies in Medievalism'' is an [[annual publication]] that, as noted on its title page, "provides an interdisciplinary medium of exchange for scholars in all fields, including the visual and other arts, concerned with any aspect of the post-medieval idea and study of the [[Middle Ages]] and its influence, both scholarly and popular, of this study on [[Western society]] after 1500."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fugelso, ed., ''Studies in Medievalism:  Defining Neomedievalism(s)'', XIX, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was founded in 1979 by [[Leslie J. Workman]] as an independent publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medievalism.net/history.html |title=History |publisher=International Society for the Study of Medievalism |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now published by [[Boydell &amp; Brewer]], Ltd., and has been edited since 2006 by Karl Fugelso.  Since 2009, each volume has begun with a series of 3,000-word, commissioned [[essay]]s on such topics as "Defining Medievalism(s)," "Defining Neomedievalism(s)," and "Medievalism and the Corporation."  But the series is otherwise open to any paper that addresses [[medievalism]] in at least 6,000 words, and recent topics have ranged from representations of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Child's History of England]]''&lt;ref&gt;Emily Walker Heady, "A Steam-Whistle Modernist?:  Representations of King Alfred in Dickens's ''A Child's History of England'' and ''The Battle of Life''," ''Studies in Medievalism:  Defining Medievalism(s)'', XVII, ed. Karl Fugelso, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to medievalist music in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Meyer, "Soundscapes of Middle Earth:  The Question of Medievalist Music in Peter Jackson's ''Lord of the Rings'' Films," ''Studies in Medievalism:  Defining Medievalism(s) II'', XVIII, ed. Karl Fugelso, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Studies in Medievalism'' does not publish reviews. All reviews of works, performances, etc., re-imagining the Middle Ages in postmedieval times are published in the journal's online review "arm," ''Medievally Speaking''.

==''The Year's Work in Medievalism''==
The journal ''[https://sites.google.com/site/theyearsworkinmedievalism/home The Year's Work in Medievalism]'' is currently edited by Edward L. Risden ([[St. Norbert College]]) and [[Richard Utz]] ([[Georgia Tech]]). Former editors include Leslie J. Workman and Gwendolyn Morgan ([[Montana State University]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">A '''landscape zodiac''' (or '''terrestrial zodiac''') is a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape, such as roads, streams and field boundaries. Perhaps the best known alleged example is the Glastonbury [[Temple of the Stars]], situated around [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], England. The temple is thought by some to depict a colossal [[zodiac]].

==Theory==
The theory was first put forward in 1935 by [[Katherine Maltwood]], an artist who "discovered" the zodiac in a vision, and held that the "temple" was created by [[Sumer]]ians about 2700 BC. Interest was re-ignited in 1969 by Mary Caine in an article in the magazine ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]''.

The landscape zodiac plays an important role in many [[occult]] theories. It has been associated with the Celtic Saints, [[Grail]] legend and [[King Arthur]] (according to some legends buried in Glastonbury).

==Criticism==
The idea was examined by two independent studies, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 &lt;ref&gt;Ian Burrow, Somerset's Planning Department staff archeologist, concluded that "while the outlines of the effigies may be plotted today, their antiquity is illusory" [http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in 1983 by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Liz Bellamy, ''Ley Lines In Question'', pages 162-168. (Tadworth, UK: World's Work, 1983). {{ISBN|0-437-19205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the standard methods of landscape historical research.  Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea.  The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors.  The Cancer boat (not a crab as would be expected) is made up of a network of eighteenth century drainage ditches and paths.  There are some [[Neolithic]] paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the "temple" in any form, from conventional archaeologists or mainstream historians.

==List of landscape zodiacs==
Beside the Glastonbury arrangement further zodiacs have been alleged in Britain in following years including:

*[[Kingston upon Thames]] Zodiac
*The Lizard Zodiac, [[Cornwall]]
*Bodmin Moor Zodiac
*The [[Pumpsaint]] Zodiac
*[[Nuthampstead]] Terrestrial Zodiac
*The [[Sheffield]] Zodiac, [[South Yorkshire]]

There is rarely a strong scientific case for these discoveries. Their nebulous existence is in many ways similar to [[urban myths]], [[ufology]], or [[ley lines]]. They seem to play a part in personal belief systems, possibly as fictional devices; for example "The Brighton Zodiac" - created by Sally Hurst, based on the streets of that town - features as a plot device in [[Robert Rankin]]'s novel "[[The Brightonomicon]]". [[Mark Valentine]] has compiled a checklist of 'The Literature of Terrestrial Zodiacs in Britain' in 'The Network of Ley Hunters' Newsletter'(&lt;ref&gt;http://wormwoodiana.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/the-literature-of-terrestrial-zodiacs.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Landscape zodiacs and psychogeography==
In the walks around the M25 motorway documented in psychogeographer [[Iain Sinclair]]'s 2003 novel ''London Orbital'', the walkers trace the mythical Kingston upon Thames Zodiac.&lt;ref name="Sinclair "&gt;Iain Sinclair, ''London Orbital '' (Penguin Books, London, 2005), {{ISBN|0-14-101474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">'''Theft from libraries''' is the crime of [[Theft|stealing]] [[book]]s, [[DVD]]s or other media from [[libraries]]. It is typically prevented by installing [[electronic article surveillance]] alarms at the doors. Library materials are tagged and if the tag is not deactivated it sounds an alarm.  In some libraries with older or rare materials, readers are not allowed to take coats or bags into the reading area except for a few items in a clear plastic bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/locker/cloakroom.html|title=Help for Researchers: Cloakroom and Lockers|publisher=British Library|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Security camera]]s are not commonly used in libraries for privacy reasons.

One study commissioned in the UK estimated the average loss rate of libraries to theft at 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sARvKM5rynkC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=library+theft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=06NcUb_4Kubq0AHCtIDgBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Planning Public Library Buildings: Concepts and Issues for the Librarian - Michael Dewe - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]], the third conviction for library theft is a [[felony]], regardless of the value of material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegielibrary.org/usingthelibrary/policies/librarytheft.html Pennsylvania Library Theft Act, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101070711/http://www.carnegielibrary.org/usingthelibrary/policies/librarytheft.html |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Library thieves, who may be staff or regular visitors of the library, risk being discovered if a book is found in the [[library catalog]] but missing from the shelves. To avoid this, some library thieves have been careful to also steal the catalog card describing the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22249700 The curious tale of the stolen books], by Martin Vennard for BBC News Magazine, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
In public libraries, librarians have noticed common themes in what subjects are most frequently stolen. Books with topics like sex and [[witchcraft]] are popular with thieves, as are guides for [[General Educational Development]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Edward|title=U.S. libraries checking out book theft / 'Most-stolen' list will help curb crime|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/U-S-libraries-checking-out-book-theft-2921164.php|publisher=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll taken in 1996, the top three books that went missing were: ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'', GED Examination Books, and the ''Prophecies'' of [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosley|first1=Shelley|last2=Caggiano|first2=Anna|last3=Charles|first3=John|title=The "Self-Weeding" Collection: The Ongoing Problem of Library Theft, and How To Fight Back.|journal=Library Journal|date=October 15, 1996|volume=121|issue=171|pages=38-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft incidents==
[[Rare books]] departments of libraries especially fall target to professional thieves. In 1996, two rare early Mormon manuscripts were stolen from the [[Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County]], when the thief requested the manuscript and replaced it with a facsimile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rbms.info/theft-reports/1996/09/26/two-mormon-publications-stolen/ | title=Two Mormon Publications Stolen | publisher=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries | date=September 26, 1996 | accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Document theft''' is the crime of stealing documents of historical, literary, or cultural interest from public or private archives, often for the purpose of sale to private collectors.  In many cases, document thieves occupy positions of trust, or have established records of legitimate accomplishment, prior to their crimes. Examples of notable convicted document thieves include former [[New York State Archives|New York State]] archivist [[Daniel D. Lorello]],&lt;ref&gt;''Albany Times Union'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frede Møller-Kristensen]], who between 1968 and 1978 stole some 1,600 historical books worth more than $50 million from the [[The Royal Library, Denmark|Danish National Library]], and antiquities dealer [[Forbes Smiley|E. Forbes Smiley III]], who stole nearly 100 maps from libraries in the United States and Great Britain over the course of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to letters, maps, and other manuscript material, rare books also attract the attention of document thieves. [[John Charles Gilkey]], for instance, stole hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books over the course of many years. These crimes were largely the product of a personal obsession, illustrating the range of motives in document thefts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Allison Hoover (2009).

Westford seceded in 1729. Carlisle fully became a part of Concord in 1780, seceding from that town in 1805. Lowell would be formed under extraordinary circumstances when the [[Boston Associates]] purchased East Chelmsford to serve as a planned factory town, incorporated as Lowell in 1826. Dracut's relationship to Chelmsford is less clear cut, however the relationship of the two towns in the 17th century resembles a slightly imperial one as Dracut, while a separate entity, was largely dependent on Chelmsford, particularly the West Dracut area, near the old boundary of East Chelmsford.

'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0703-021, Schwerin, Indianistiktreffen.jpg|thumb|Eastern German Living history at an "Indianistikmeeting" 1982 in [[Schwerin]]]]
[[File:Guédelon - mai 2014 - 24.JPG|thumb|The [[Guédelon Castle]] in France is a castle currently built using only medieval construction techniques, tools, costumes and local materials.]]
Living history approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),&lt;ref Name="Ban"&gt;Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem Häkelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer Überblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, Köln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beiträgen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander Häusler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt;

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Landshut Wedding]] or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt; started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: 2008, S. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Borries, Jens-Uwe Fischer: ''Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/ Main 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
That sort of 'second hand' living history&lt;ref name=gf&gt;Volkskultur aus fremder Hand - Indianer- und Westernhobby in Deutschland zwischen Amerikanisierung, " Anti-Imperialismus" und popularisierter Ethnologie, doctorate Albert - Ludwigs - Universität zu Freiburg i. Br, Gabriele Wilczek 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is as well part of western Germany folklore and tries for a high level of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/zu-besuch-bei-deutschen-indianern/a-16716293 Zu Besuch bei deutschen "Indianern"] Deutsche Welle 07.05.2013, Ananda Grade&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0628-0006-001, Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer.jpg|thumb|1970 Mandan Indian real history event in [[Taucha]], near Leipzig, Eastern Germany]]

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
[[File:Vikingtent.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Viking encampment.]]

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In education==
[[File:Highlander-actor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A reenactor from a living history group.]]
[[File:Lincoln living.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Abraham Lincoln in present time.]]
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  “Interpreters” are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual’s personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered “folk artifacts,” which are grouped under the heading of “material culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Experiential learning]], "About"&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], “That the Future May Learn from the Past,” proclaims the site’s commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled “Applied History,” in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.&lt;ref&gt;James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist historiography''', or [[historical materialist]] historiography, is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by [[Marxism]].  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes.

Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. The chief problematic aspect of Marxist historiography has been an argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] factors in creating outcomes.

Marxist history is generally [[Determinism|deterministic]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics|author1=Ben Fine|author2=Alfredo Saad-Filho|author3=Marco Boffo|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe0VQArHt8sC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=determinism#v=onepage&amp;q=determinism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=marxist+history+deterministic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRsLn61NfXAhUJK48KHXprAcg4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=marxist%20history%20deterministic&amp;f=false|page=5|title=|first=J.J.|last= O'Rourke|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pem7Ip_WUgC&amp;pg=PA247|first=Kenneth|last=Stunkel|page=247|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; it posits a direction of history, towards an end state of history as [[classless]] human society. Marxist historiography, that is, the writing of Marxist history in line with the given historiographical principles, is generally seen as a tool. Its aim is to bring those oppressed by history to [[Self-actualization#Self-actualization|self-consciousness]], and to arm them with tactics and strategies from history: it is both a historical and a liberatory project.

Historians who use Marxist methodology, but disagree with the mainstream of Marxism, often describe themselves as ''marxist'' historians (with a lowercase ''M'').  Methods from Marxist historiography, such as class analysis, can be divorced from the liberatory intent of Marxist historiography; such practitioners often refer to their work as ''marxian'' or ''Marxian''.

==Marx and Engels==

[[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis.

Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society.

Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics.

==Marx and labor==

Key to understanding Marxist historiography is his view of labor. For Marx "historical reality is none other than objectified labor, and all conditions of labor given by nature, including the organic bodies of people, are merely preconditions and 'disappearing moments' of the labor process."&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Maidansky. "The Logic of Marx's History," Russian Studies in Philosophy, vol. 51, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the physical as the determining factor in history represents a break from virtually all previous historians. Until Marx developed his theory of [[historical materialism]], the overarching determining factor in the direction of history was some sort of divine agency.  In Marx's view of history "God became a mere projection of human imagination" and more importantly "a tool of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach. Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, 3rd Ed. (Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press, 2007), pg. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no more sense of divine direction to be seen. History moved by the sheer force of human labor, and all theories of divine nature were a concoction of the ruling powers to keep the working people in check. For Marx, "The first historical act is... the production of material life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As one might expect, Marxist history not only begins with labor, it ends in production: "history does not end by being resolved into "self-consciousness" as "spirit of the spirit," but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor..."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; For further, and much more comprehensive, information on this topic, see [[historical materialism]].

==In the Soviet Union==
{{details|Historiography in the Soviet Union}}

Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Soviet historians tended to avoid contemporary history (history after 1905) where possible and effort was predominantly directed at premodern history.  As history was considered to be a politicised academic discipline, historians limited their creative output to avoid prosecution.

Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s, which was written in order to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]].

==The Communist Party Historians Group in Britain==
{{Main|Communist Party Historians Group}}
A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. They shared a common interest in "history from below" and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. E. P. Thompson famously engaged [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]] in ''[[The Poverty of Theory]]'', arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history, and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.

Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work.

[[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB.

== In India ==
In India, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One debate in Indian history that relates to a [[historical materialist]] schema is on the nature of [[feudalism]] in India. [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1960s outlined the idea of "feudalism from below" and "feudalism from above". R. S. Sharma largely agrees with Kosambi in his various books.&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''[[Indian Feudalism (book)]], 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation'', Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''India's Ancient Past'', Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D N Jha, ''The Feudal Order: State Society and Ideology in Early Medieval India'', Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Most Indian Marxists argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a "world capitalist system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit women in India: issues and perspective|page=138|first=Prahlad|last=Jogdand|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. R. Ambedkar]] criticized Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of [[caste]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7ffDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|title=Development-Induced Displacement in India and China: A Comparative Look at the Burdens of Growth|last=Padovani|first=Florence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|quote=Bhimrao Ambedkar himself, who criticized Indian Marxists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of [[history of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India|quote=Marxists who always try to cover up the black spots of Muslim rule with thick coats of whitewash|first=Kishori Saran|last=Lal|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Politics, Then and Now: Essays in Historical Perspective|first=K|last=Seshadri|publisher=Pragatee Prakashan|page=5|quote=certain attempts made by some ultra-Marxist historians to justify and even whitewash tyrannical emperors of the medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in World Affairs, Volume 1|first=KR|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publisher|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw9uf7sRKtIC&amp;pg=PA249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11Th-13th Centuries|last=Wink|first=André|publisher=BRILL|page=309|quote="apologists for Islam, as well as some marxist scholars in India have sometimes attempted to reduce Islamic iconoclasm.."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] scholars especially have polemicized against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible for aiding or defending [[Islam in India|Muslims]], who figure in Hindu nationalist discourse as the enemy within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0RZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=|title=The Construction of History and Nationalism in India: Textbooks, Controversies and Politics|last=Guichard|first=Sylvie|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a critique is [[Arun Shourie]]'s ''[[Eminent Historians]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, E. E. (2014). Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Cary, USA: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==

===Origins===
Right-wing conspiracy theories began circulating in the days following Rich's death,&lt;ref name="evenabout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bonkers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sethrichhomicide" /&gt; including false claims that his murder was connected to the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|DNC email leak of 2016]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or the FBI's investigation of the [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="sethrichhomicide"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kim |last=LaCapria |url=http://www.snopes.com/seth-conrad-rich/ |title=Seth Rich Homicide |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Whitehouse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitehouse |first=John |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/05/27/how-the-murder-of-a-dnc-staffer-turned-into-a-right-wing-conspiracy_partner/ |title=How the murder of a DNC staffer turned into a right-wing conspiracy |date=May 27, 2017 |work=Salon |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A post on Twitter before Rich's memorial service originated the idea that his killing was a political assassination.&lt;ref name="evenabout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/is-this-even-about-seth-rich-at-all.html |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |title='Is This Even About Seth Rich at All?' |first=Olivia |last=Nuzzi |date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the conspiracy theory was spread on the subreddit [[/r/The Donald]], and on July 29, 2016, the website ''[[Heat Street]]'' reported on these [[Reddit]] posts.&lt;ref name="John Whitehouse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zanotti |first=Emily |url=http://heatst.com:80/politics/still-no-clues-in-murder-of-dncs-seth-rich-as-conspiracy-theories-thicken/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930120844/http://heatst.com/politics/still-no-clues-in-murder-of-dncs-seth-rich-as-conspiracy-theories-thicken/ |title=Dem Aide Seth Rich's Death Still Inspiring Conspiracy Theories |dead-url=yes |date=July 29, 2016 |archive-date=September 30, 2016 |work=Heat Street |accessdate=March 14, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit users attempted to tie the homicide to prior "[[Clinton Body Count]]" conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="bonkers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/24/15685560/seth-rich-conspiracy-theory-explained-fox-news-hannity |publisher=[[Vox.com]] |title=The bonkers Seth Rich conspiracy theory, explained |date=May 24, 2017 |first=Jeff |last=Guo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy theory was later popularized by Donald Trump political adviser [[Roger Stone]] via his Twitter account.&lt;ref name="evenabout" /&gt;

According to British journalist [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]], the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, tried to implicate Rich as the source of the stolen DNC emails, in order to draw attention away from themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445769/Briton-ran-pro-Kremlin-disinformation-campaign-that-helped-Trump-deny-Russian-links |title=Briton ran pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign that helped Trump deny Russian links |date=July 31, 2018  |publisher=Computer Weekly |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Datestamps on the DNC files were altered to show the data had been obtained on July 5, 2016, five days before Rich's death, and the timezone was changed to Eastern Time, within which Washington, D.C. falls. Guccifer 2.0, the alleged GRU front that provided the emails to Wikileaks, then reported that Rich had been their source. Based partly on their acceptance of the false dates, some experts then concluded that the emails had been copied in the DNC offices, and had not been hacked from outside.&lt;ref&gt; Tucker, Patrick (August 2, 2018).

====WikiLeaks statements====
[[Julian Assange]], the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with ''[[Nieuwsuur]]'' published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources.&lt;ref name="nieuws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2124316-assange-belooft-nieuwe-onthullingen-over-clinton.html |title=Assange belooft nieuwe onthullingen over Clinton |first= |last=Nieuwsuur |date=August 9, 2016 |language=Dutch |publisher=Nieuwsuur |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unbidden, Assange brought up the case of Seth Rich. When asked directly whether Rich was a source, Assange nodded, then said "we don't comment on who our sources are".&lt;ref name="youtube_Kp7FkLBRpKg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg |title=Julian Assange on Seth Rich |first= |last=Nieuwsuur |date=August 9, 2016 |publisher= |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent statements by WikiLeaks emphasized that the organization was not naming Rich as a source.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morton |first=Joseph |url=http://www.omaha.com/news/crime/wikileaks-offers-reward-for-help-finding-omaha-native-seth-rich/article_cfb287bc-5e98-11e6-ae0c-8b471b8cbfbb.html |title=WikiLeaks offers $20,000 reward for help finding Omaha native Seth Rich's killer |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For context, Assange was well-known as a longtime critic of Clinton,&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/11/assange-clinton-should-quit-045756 |title=Assange: Clinton should quit |first=Jennifer |last=Epstein |date=November 30, 2010 |publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it subsequently came to light that WikiLeaks communicated with the Trump campaign over other issues, casting doubt on Assange's motivation.&lt;ref name="DMs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/11/15/wikileaks-julian-assange-donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton/ |title=Julian Assange's Hatred of Hillary Clinton Was No Secret.

In April 2018, Twitter direct messages revealed that even as Assange was suggesting publicly that WikiLeaks had obtained emails from Seth Rich, Assange was trying to obtain more emails from the hacker [[Guccifer 2.0]], who was at the time suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence. ''BuzzFeed'' described the messages as "the starkest proof yet that Assange knew a likely Russian government hacker had the Democrat leaks he wanted.

The [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] described the murder as related to a bungled attempted robbery,&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; and said "the assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; The FBI told PolitiFact.com that the MPD was investigating the homicide.&lt;ref name="politifactgillin" /&gt;

Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham said the police had no information suggesting a connection between Rich's death and data obtained by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

People who worked with Rich said he was not an expert computer hacker helping to leak information to foreigners. Andrew Therriault, a data scientist who had mentored Rich, said although he had recently been working as a programmer, this "wasn't his background", and another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard hackers associated with Russian intelligence services had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_january_18_2017" /&gt;

Rich family representative, Brad Bauman, responding to the conspiracy theorists' claim that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was investigating the case said, "The FBI is not now and has never been a party to this investigation."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;

FactCheck.org analyzed statements by [[Newt Gingrich]] related to the conspiracy theory, where Gingrich said Rich "apparently was assassinated" subsequent to "having given WikiLeaks something like … 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments".&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt; FactCheck.org determined this claim was "unsupported" and determined "there's no evidence for his claim."&lt;ref name="eugenekiely" /&gt;

PolitiFact.com said the assertion that Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks is a "baseless claim", concluding "Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."&lt;ref name="politifact" /&gt; In a separate analysis, PolitiFact.com concluded: "There's no evidence there's any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong."&lt;ref name="politifactgillin" /&gt;

Snopes.com looked into the matter and stated: "We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder — it is an MPD investigation." Snopes contacted a spokesman for the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, who said, "All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Snopes rated the claim "DNC staffer Seth Rich sent 'thousands of leaked e-mails' to WikiLeaks before he was murdered" as "False".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The fabrications were described as [[fake news]] and falsehoods by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="fakenewsendures" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the persistence of false claims, concluding: "fake news dies hard".&lt;ref name="fakenewsendures" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the conspiracy theories "unsubstantiated rumors".&lt;ref name="shalby" /&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the power of fake news to spread virally online.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; The paper used the example as a case study of the persistence of fake news, and found that television news media can be a soft target for such false stories.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' further found that the proliferation of fake news via Facebook had decreased, but remained powerful on Twitter due to spread via online bots.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; They found that the conspiracy theories with the largest potential to spread on the Internet were those that held attraction for both the alt-right movements and the political left wing.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' concluded that even if a particular false story had been sufficiently debunked, such fact-checking was unable to stop the spread of the falsehoods online.&lt;ref name="fakenewsstillworks" /&gt;

=== Fox News retracted reporting ===

Other news organizations revealed Wheeler was a Donald Trump supporter, a paid Fox News contributor, and according to [[NBC News]] had "developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as&amp;nbsp;one appearance&amp;nbsp;on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/rod-wheeler |title=Meet The Private Detective Who Ignited A Clinton Conspiracy Theory |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' noted it is "rare for a news organization to have such a close relationship with the people it is covering", as Wheeler was "playing three roles at once: as a Fox source, as a paid contributor to the network and as a supposedly independent investigator of the murder".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; When Wheeler appeared on [[Sean Hannity]]'s Fox News shows, these multiple roles were not disclosed to viewers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; After Wheeler's Fox News interview on May 15, 2017, Brad Bauman, a communications professional and spokesman for the Rich family, said the family was asking Fox News and the Fox affiliate to retract their reports and apologize for damaging their son's legacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The family spokesperson, the Washington, D.C. police department, the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case all disputed Wheeler's claims.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/family-of-slain-seth-rich-says-reports-he-fed-wikileaks-dnc-info-are-untrue/2017/05/16/9b32ef9c-3a46-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html |title=Family of slain Seth Rich says reports that he fed DNC info to WikiLeaks are untrue |work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family said, "We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers."&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; Bauman criticized Fox News for its reporting, saying he believed that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: "I think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.snopes.com/seth-rich-dnc-wikileaks-murder/ |title=Fact Check: Did DNC Staffer Seth Rich Send 'Thousands of E-Mails' to WikiLeaks Before He Was Murdered? |work=[[Snopes.com]] |date=May 16, 2017|access-date=May 16, 2017 |first=Bethania |last=Palma |quote=We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder — it is an MPD investigation...

===Wheeler lawsuit===
On August 1, 2017, Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Butowsky who was the first to claim links between Seth Rich's murder and the DNC hack on Fox, but who later appeared to retract his claims, filed a lawsuit (Case 1:17-cv-05807 Southern District of New York), in which 21st Century Fox, the Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and [[Ed Butowsky]] are named as defendants, stating that quotes attributed to him in the original Fox News piece were fabricated. The lawsuit also alleges that the fabricated quotes were included in the Fox News story at the urging of the Trump White House.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bump |first=Philip |date=August 1, 2017 |title=A timeline of the explosive lawsuit alleging a White House link in the Seth Rich conspiracy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/01/a-timeline-of-the-explosive-lawsuit-alleging-a-white-house-link-in-the-seth-rich-conspiracy/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |location=|access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540783715/lawsuit-alleges-fox-news-and-trump-supporter-created-fake-news-story |title=Behind Fox News' Baseless Seth Rich Story: The Untold Tale |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text messages and audio apparently supporting this assertion were included in the filing of the lawsuit. About a month before the story was aired on Fox News, Wheeler and Butowsky met at the White House with the White House Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]] to review the planned story on Seth Rich's murder. After talking to Wheeler and Butowsky, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft of a story without any quotes from Wheeler on May 11. On May 14 Butowsky texted Wheeler saying ''"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure."'' Butowsky also left a voicemail for Wheeler which said ''"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;
Butowsky said [[Seymour Hersh]] confirmed a link between Rich and the FBI. Hersh confirmed the conversation with Butowsky but told NPR the link was "gossip" and that Butowsky exaggerated its significance.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In an email to Fox News Butowsky also wrote about the purpose behind the Seth Rich story: ''"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion (between) Trump and the Russians."'' He also instructed Wheeler that ''"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections (...) If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

When the story aired on Fox News, it included supposed quotes from Wheeler and was written as if the accusations against the DNC came from him. Wheeler alleges that the quotes were fabricated and should not have been attributed to him.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In later recordings Butowsky told Wheeler that the claims being attributed to him were false but says that ''"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say."'' He also says ''"I know that's not true, if I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that."''&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Judge [[George B. Daniels]] dismissed this lawsuit in August 2018.&lt;ref name="lawsuits dismissed"&gt;{{cite news |last=Segers |first=Grace |title=Seth Rich case against Fox News dismissed by federal judge |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-rich-case-dismissed-by-federal-judge/ |publisher=CBS |date=August 2, 2018 |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family's reactions===

In May 2017, Seth Rich's brother Aaron Rich issued a statement saying, "We simply want to find his killers and grieve. Instead, we are stuck having to constantly fight against non-facts, baseless allegations, and general stupidity to defend my brother's name and legacy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The family spokesperson said "At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies."&lt;ref name="Wash Post Weigel 2017-05-21 Gingrich"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/21/gingrich-spreads-conspiracy-theory-about-slain-dnc-staffer/ |title=Gingrich spreads conspiracy theory about slain DNC staffer |date=May 21, 2017|access-date=May 21, 2017 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] PowerPost blog |author=[[David Weigel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents authored a piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on May 23, 2017 titled: "We're Seth Rich's parents. Stop politicizing our son's murder," in which they wrote:

{{Quote|We are asking you to please consider our feelings and words. There are people who are using our beloved Seth's memory and legacy for their own political goals, and they are using your outrage to perpetuate our nightmare. We ask those purveying falsehoods to give us peace, and to give law enforcement the time and space to do the investigation they need to solve our son's murder.&lt;ref name="washpostparents" /&gt;}}

In March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich. The suit alleges that the report fueled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and caused the family emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Del Moro |first=Michael |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/family-slain-dnc-staffer-sues-fox-news-retracted/story?id=53725795 |title=Family of slain DNC staffer sues Fox News over retracted story |date=March 13, 2018 |work=ABC News |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[George B. Daniels]] dismissed the lawsuit in August 2018, stating that the case failed to prove "extreme and outrageous" conduct on the part of defendants, as that standard is determined under New York state law.&lt;ref name="lawsuits dismissed"&gt;{{cite news |last=Segers |first=Grace |title=Seth Rich case against Fox News dismissed by federal judge |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seth-rich-case-dismissed-by-federal-judge/ |publisher=CBS |date=August 2, 2018 |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in March 2018, Aaron Rich filed a lawsuit against Butowsky, Couch, America First Media, and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' for suggesting he had played a role in the purported theft of emails from the DNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/27/media/seth-rich-brother-sues-washington-times/index.html?iid=EL |title=Seth Rich's brother sues right-wing activists, Washington Times over conspiracy theories |last=Darcy |first=Oliver |work=CNNMoney|access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2018, as part of a settlement they had reached with Aaron Rich, ''The Washington Times'' retracted the relevant articles and issued an apology to Rich and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/10/01/media/washington-times-aaron-rich/index.html |title=The Washington Times settles lawsuit with Seth Rich's brother, issues retraction and apology for its coverage |last=Darcy |first=Oliver |work=CNNMoney |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

[[Comet]]s, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, or water-rich [[meteoroid]]s ([[protoplanet]]s) from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]] colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans.

Large-enough [[planetesimal]]s were heated by the decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water in the development of Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Planetary differentiation}}
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Delian League]] before the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC.]]
'''''Pentecontaetia''''' ({{lang-el|πεντηκονταετία}}, "the period of fifty years") is the term used to refer to the period in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] history between the defeat of the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] in 479 BC and the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. The term originated with a scholiast on [[Thucydides]], who used it in their description of the period. The ''Pentecontaetia'' was marked by the rise of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] as the dominant state in the Greek world and by the rise of [[Athenian democracy]]. Since Thucydides focused his account on these developments, the term is generally used when discussing developments in and involving Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ehrenberg and P.J. Rhodes, "Pentecontaetia," from ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Greek victory of 479 BC, Athens assumed the leadership of the [[Delian League]], a coalition of states that wished to continue the war against Persia. This league experienced a [[Wars of the Delian League|number of successes]] and was soon established as the dominant military force of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  Athenian control over the league grew as some "allies" were reduced to the status of tribute-paying subjects and by the middle of the 5th century BC (the league treasury was moved from [[Delos]] to Athens in 454 BC) the league had been transformed into an Athenian empire.  Athens benefited greatly from this tribute, undergoing a [[Fifth Century Athens|cultural renaissance]] and undertaking massive public building projects, including the [[Parthenon]]; Athenian democracy, meanwhile, developed into what is today called radical or [[Periclean democracy]], in which the popular [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly of the citizens]] and the large, citizen juries exercised near-complete control over the state.

The later years of the ''Pentecontaetia'' were marked by increasing conflict between Athens and the traditional land powers of Greece, led by [[Sparta]]. Between 460 BC and 445 BC, Athens fought a shifting coalition of mainland powers in what is now known as the [[First Peloponnesian War]]. During the course of this conflict, Athens gained and then lost control of large areas of [[central Greece]].  The conflict was concluded by the [[Thirty Years' Peace]], which lasted until the end of the ''Pentecontaetia'' and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.

The eventual breakdown of the peace was triggered by increasing conflict between Athens and several of Sparta's allies. Athens' alliance with [[Corcyra]] and attack on [[Potidaea]] enraged [[Corinth]], and the [[Megarian decree]] imposed strict economic sanctions on Megara, another Spartan ally.  These disputes, along with a general perception that Athenian power had grown too powerful, led to the breakdown of the Thirty Years Peace; the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC.

== Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480—431) ==
'''479'''—Rebuilding of Athens: Although the Greeks were victorious in the Persian War, many Greeks believed that the Persians would retaliate. This led Athens to rebuild its long walls that were razed by the Persian Army during the occupation of [[Attica]] in 480.

'''478'''—Formation of the Delian League: Athens and other city states form a coalition against Persia.

'''477'''—The Conquest of Eion: [[Cimon]], the son of Miltiades of Marathon fame, led Athens to numerous victorious campaigns and war profits. In 477, he led an army against Persian-occupied Eion in northern Greece. Athens was able to benefit from this invasion since the region was rich in timber, which was critical to building Athens' burgeoning naval fleet.

'''476'''—The Conquest of Scyros: The invasions continued with success on a par with Cimon's prior campaigns. In 476, Athens fought against the pirates of Scyros, as the Delian League wanted to reduce piracy around the region and capture the important materials for itself.

'''469'''—Operation in Asia Minor and the Battle of Eurymedon: From the beginning of 469 to 466, the Delian league led an army to [[Asia Minor]] against Persia. Cimon persuaded Greek settlements on the Carian and Lycian coast to rebel against Persia. This led the Persian army to mobilize a force to fight Cimon in the [[Battle of Eurymedon]] in [[Pamphylsia]]. Cimon was able to defeat the Persian army swiftly and the war profits were used to finance Athens' city walls.

'''465'''—Operations in Northern Greece: Athens' powers and desire for expansion grow. In 465, after [[Cleruchy|cleruchizing]] the Chersonese, they tried to gain control of [[Thasos]]. Thucydides wrote that Sparta contemplated an invasion of Attica in order to help free Thasos. However, in the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake and subsequent helot uprising in Sparta, no attack—if indeed such was projected—was launched.

'''461'''—The Debate in Athens over Helping Sparta: With a legion of [[Helot]]s rebelling against Sparta, Athens offered Sparta their help by sending a force of 4,000 [[Hoplite]]s to suppress the rebels. According to Thucydides, Sparta decided to dismiss Cimon's Athenian Army, because they felt that Athens would convince the Helots on [[Ithome]] to form a coalition and besiege Sparta. Spartans did not feel comfortable with such a large Athenian force inside their city. If the Athenians were to turn their backs on Sparta, the city would not be able to protect itself. At this point, Sparta acknowledged that Athens might be getting too powerful. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were deeply offended by their removal from Ithome. They denounced their original treaty with Sparta made during the Greco-Persian Wars, then proceeded to make an alliance with [[Argos]], a major enemy of the Spartans. 

'''460'''—Athens' Clash with Corinth over Megara: Megarians joined the Delian League due to a war between Megara and Corinth. This angered the Corinthians. Even using Athens' weakest soldiers, being the old and young men who were left behind in the city, they were able to win the war against Corinth with ease.

'''460'''—The Athenian Expedition to Egypt: Athens led a coalition with the Egyptians to rebel against Persia. However, their six-year expedition did not lead to much success against Persia, as 100 Athenian ships were destroyed in the Delta region.

'''458'''—The Long Walls: The construction of the long walls gave Athens a major military advantage by forming a barrier around the city-state and its harbors, which allowed their ships to access waterways without threat from outside forces. Two walls were constructed from the city to the sea, one to [[Phaleron]] and the other to [[Piraeus]]. Athens relied on these long walls to protect itself from invasion, while sending off its superior vessels to bombard opponents' cities.

'''458'''—The Battle of Tanagra: According to Thucydides, Spartans aided the Dorians by invading Greece, because they were motivated by ethnic solidarity. Sparta sent out 1500 Hoplites and an additional 10,000 from their allies' forces to suppress the Phocians' Army invading Doris. The Spartans were victorious, but they found themselves stuck in this foreign land. Athens, suspecting a plot by the Spartans to overthrow the democracy and to prevent the building of the Long Walls, then attacked the Spartans at Tanagra in [[Boeotia]] with a force of 14,000. The Spartans were victorious in this battle.

'''457'''—The Battle of Oenophyta: After the Spartans returned home from Tanagra, the Athenians conquered Boetia and [[Phocis]] after a battle at [[Oenophyta]]. They then proceeded to tear down Tanagra's fortifications. 

'''450'''—The Peace of Callias—Although this peace treaty is subject to scholarly debate, allegedly Athens and Persia agreed to a ceasefire.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peace of Callias {{!}} ancient Greece-Persia [450 449 BC]|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-Callias|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''447'''—Athens' forces were defeated at Coronea, causing the Athenian army to flee [[Boeotia]].

'''446'''—The Peloponnesian Invasion of Attica: Athens continued their indirect war with Sparta by attempting to gain control of Delphi. City-states such as Megara and Euboea began to rebel against Athens and the Delian League when the Spartan Army invaded Athenian territory.

'''445'''—The Thirty-Year Peace Between Athens and Sparta: After losing Attica, Boeotia and Megara, Athens agreed to a thirty-year peace in return for all the conquered areas in the Peloponnesian region. From this point on, all future conflicts between Athens and Sparta were resolved under arbitration.

'''447'''—Athenian Colonization and the Colony of Brea: With the 30-year peace treaty, Athens was able to concentrate attention towards growth rather than war. From 447-445, the Delian League was able to influence city-states near the Mediterranean to join and pay tribute (phoro). This helped the region because the tributes paid by each and every city-state were reduced with the increasing number of members joining the league.

'''441'''—The Samian Revolt—Athens decided to besiege [[Samos]] after their revolt in 441. However, Persia decided to take the opportunity to support Samos even though they have signed the Peace of Callias with Athens. Athens would eventually spend 1200 talents to fund the war through the Delian League's treasury. Some scholars believed that Sparta might have aided Samos as well, but decided to pull out, having they signed the Thirty-year peace treaty.

'''437'''—The Foundation of Amphipolis: With vast resources, especially timber for ship building, Athens founded the city of [[Amphipolis]] on the Strymon River. Amphipolis was immensely important to Athens since it controlled many trading routes.

'''432'''—The Potidaean Affair: Athens was threatened by the possibility of a revolt, plotted by Corinth and [[Macedon]]. After fighting in Macedon, which ended when the two countries came to terms with each other, Athens came to Potidaea. They had previously demanded that Potidaea tear down their long walls and banish Corinth ambassadors. However, by the time Athens reached Potidaea, the residents were in full revolt and prepared to fight Athens with support from the Corinthian army. The Corinthians was also able to influence the Spartans to join the cause, since Sparta didn't want to lose such an affluent ally. The fighting concluded with an Athenian victory. 

'''432'''—The Megarian Decree: With Sparta's aid, Megara urged Athens to drop their decree against them since it was hurting their economy; they were forbidden to use Athen's markets and harbors. Athens claims that Megarians insulted them by trespassing on land sacred to [[Demeter]] and murdering an Athenian ambassador. However, most scholars believe it was an act of vengeance when Megara revolted during the early parts of the Pentecontaetia.

'''432'''—Peloponnesian War—This marked the end of the Pentecontaetia, as Athens and Sparta engaged in all-out war, which eventually led to the demise of the Athenian Empire.

=== Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia ===
After the exile of Cimon in Athens, his rivals [[Ephialtes]] and Pericles implemented democratic social reforms. In 462, Ephialtes challenged the [[Areopagus]], claiming that they were abusing their powers. Part of the reform was to introduce "[[graphe paranomon]]" or public protest against illegal decrees. Any citizen would have the right to challenge a previous degree instilled by the Areopagus and claim it as invalid. The assembly would have to conduct a "dokimasia" or examination of state officials before they enter office. Opportunities for citizens to join the office were increased tremendously when 500 members were added. Transferring the powers of the Areopagus to all Athenian citizens enabled a more democratic society. 

These democratic ideals are reflected in the use of personal names without a [[Patronymic]] on inscriptions of casualty lists from around this time, such as those of the tribe [[Erechtheis]] dated to 460/459BC &lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and the Argive dead at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 111&lt;/ref&gt;. Without the [[Patronymic]] or demotic it would have been impossible to identify the particular individual being referred to when multiplicity of the same name occurred, thus both reducing the impact of the long list and ensuring that individuals are deprived of their social context.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 p 61&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ephialtes death, his younger partner Pericles continued with reforms, transforming Athens into the most democratic city-state of Ancient Greece. During 450, he implemented a state salary of two obols per day for jurors to increase public participation from citizens. However, this system caused an outrage from the elites, claiming that the poor were uneducated and incapable of governing.

=== Increasing Tensions Leading to War ===
[[Thucydides]] offers us a unique perspective to view the [[Peloponnesian War]] since he actually took part in the conflict. This first-hand experience allows a look into the mind of a person at the center of the ordeal. The conflict between Athens and Sparta is in Thucydides’ eyes an inevitable confrontation of the two major powers. The beginning of this tension begins during the incipient stages of the Athenian empire following the defeat of Persia during a period called the “pentekontaetia”. The pentekontaetia began in 479 and ended with the outbreak of war. With great confidence in their military abilities, perhaps a bit of instilled machoism, and the need for an anti-Persian alliance, Athens begins recruiting various Greek city-states into an alliance called the [[Delian League]]. The growth of Athenian power through the [[Delian League]] is centered on a growing navy, the rebuilding of the walls that protect the city from land-based attackers, and an aggressive push to extend their influence which included a few skirmishes with other powers. [[Thucydides]] writes about how this period of growth was an inevitable cause of war, “Their supremacy grew during the interval between the present war and the Persian wars, through their military and political actions recounted below against the barbarians, against their own allies in revolt, and against the Peloponnesians whom they encountered on various occasions.” (1.97 [2])

Athenian naval supremacy was a great fear of [[Sparta]] and her allies. While the Spartans combat prowess was unmatched on land, when it came to the sea [[Athens]] was the clear victor. This split seemed to have already been accepted by the Spartans many years earlier, however the aggressiveness and effectiveness of Athenian naval warfare had yet to be fully realized. According to [[Thucydides]] following the defeat of [[Persia]], Athens begins to reconstruct the long walls which connected the main city of Athens to the port of [[Piraeus]] around 478.  “Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards [[Athens]] on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle with Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause them secret annoyance.” (1.92 [1]) The Spartan annoyance stems partly from the long walls being a major deterrent to land based, non-siege tactics which the Spartans were particularly adept at, but also from the way in which the deal was brokered.

[[Thucydides]] writes of [[Themistocles]], an envoy to [[Sparta]], who in 479 changed the tide of history by hiding the facts regarding the construction of the walls around [[Athens]] and those of the [[Piraeus]]. In Themistocles’speech to the Spartan assembly Thucydides points out that at this point Athenian independence was highlighted. “Wherever they had deliberated with the Spartans, they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to none.” (1.91 [5]) This is an important step because Themistocles articulates that Athens is an independent state with its own agenda that brushed over that of others. This is a very important point in the lead up to the [[Peloponnesian War]] because one man is credited with making the split. [[Themistocles]] through his cunningness asserts an independent and strong Athenian identity. He makes it clear after the walls have been secured (ensuring Athenian strength) that Athens is independent and is making self-interested decisions. Furthermore, [[Themistocles]] also predicts that the growth in Athenian power will be centered on the sea. “For he first ventured to tell them to stick to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire.” (1.93 [5]) [[Thucydides]] credits [[Themistocles]] with the determining point in which Athens becomes an empire creating the divide between [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]].

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodernity''' ('''post-modernity''' or the '''postmodern condition''') is the economic or cultural state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]]. (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.) Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – and that it was replaced by postmodernity, while others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity, while some believe that modernity ended after World War II. The idea of the post-modern condition is sometimes characterised as a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state{{huh|date=August 2018}}&lt;!-- what is autonomous from what?--&gt; as opposed to the progressive mindstate of [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity can mean a personal response to a postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the [[state of being]] that is associated with a postmodern society as well a historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from [[postmodernism]], the adoption of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern philosophies]] or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship{{huh|date=August 2018}}, the result of which is the evolving culture of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nilges|first1=Mathias|title=The Presence of Postmodernism in Contemporary American Literature|journal=American Literary History|date=Spring 2015|volume=27|issue=1|pages=186–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the term ==
''Postmodernity'' is the state or condition of being postmodern – after or in reaction to that which is modern, as in [[postmodern art]] (''see [[postmodernism]]''). [[Modernity]] is defined as a period or condition loosely identified with the Progressive Era, the [[Industrial Revolution]], or [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]]. In [[philosophy]] and [[critical theory]] ''postmodernity'' refers to the state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]], a historical condition that marks the reasons for the end of [[modernity]]. This usage is ascribed to the philosophers [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]].

One "project" of modernity is said by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] to have been the fostering of progress by incorporating principles of [[rationality]] and [[hierarchy]] into public and artistic life. (See also [[postindustrial]], [[Information Age]].) Lyotard understood [[modernity]] as a cultural condition characterized by constant change in the pursuit of progress. Postmodernity then represents the culmination of this process where constant change has become the ''[[status quo]]'' and the notion of progress obsolete. Following [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s critique of the possibility of absolute and total knowledge, Lyotard further argued that the various [[metanarrative]]s of progress such as [[Positivism|positivist]] [[science]], [[Marxism]], and [[structuralism]] were defunct as methods of achieving progress.

The literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]] and the geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] have identified postmodernity with "[[late capitalism]]" or "flexible accumulation", a stage of capitalism following [[finance capitalism]], characterised by highly mobile labor and capital and what Harvey called "time and space compression". They suggest that this coincides with the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] which, they believe, defined the economic order following the Second World War. (See also [[consumerism]], [[critical theory]].)

Those who generally view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, a flaw in humanity's evolution leading to disasters like [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]], see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the modern project, see the state of postmodernity as a negative consequence of holding postmodernist ideas. For example, [[Jürgen Habermas]] and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running [[counter-enlightenment]] ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universality]] cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the consequence of holding postmodern ideas, is generally a negative term in this context.

==Postmodernism==
{{Main article|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernity is a condition or a state of being associated with changes to institutions and creations ([[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], 1990) and with social and political results and innovations, globally but especially in the West since the 1950s, whereas [[postmodernism]] is an aesthetic, literary, political or social philosophy, the "cultural and intellectual phenomenon", especially since the 1920s' new movements in the arts. Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that are the result of features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the [[commoditization]] of knowledge (''see'' "[[Modernity]]"). {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The relationship between postmodernity and critical theory, sociology and philosophy is fiercely contested. The terms "postmodernity" and "postmodernism" are often hard to distinguish, the former being often the result of the latter. The period has had diverse political ramifications: its "anti-ideological ideas" appear to have been associated with the [[feminist movement]], racial equality movements, [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movements]], most forms of late 20th century [[anarchism]] and even the [[peace movement]] as well as various hybrids of these in the current [[anti-globalization movement]]. Though none of these institutions entirely embraces all aspects of the postmodern movement in its most concentrated definition they all reflect, or borrow from, some of its core ideas. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== History ==
Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], believe that modernity ended in the late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely postmodernity, while others, such as [[Zygmunt Bauman|Bauman]] and [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. Others still contend that modernity ended with the [[Victorian Age]] in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = William D. | title = Black Intellectuals, Black Cognition, and a Black Aesthetic | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-275-95542-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity has been said{{By whom|date=September 2009}} to have gone through two relatively distinct phases the first beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s and ending with the [[Cold War]] (when [[Analog signal|analog]] media with limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] encouraged a few, authoritative media channels) and the second beginning at the end of the Cold War (marked by the spread of cable television and "new media" based on [[Digital data|digital]] means of information dissemination and broadcast).

The first phase of postmodernity overlaps the end of [[modernity]] and is regarded by many{{By whom|date=September 2009|Whom}} as being part of the modern period ''(see [[lumpers/splitters]], [[periodization]])''. Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the [[baby boom]] generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Vietnam War]], to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to [[divorce]], increased use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Psychedelic Drug|psychedelics]], the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including [[Rock and roll|rock music]] and the ubiquity of [[stereo]], television and [[radio]] helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a [[media culture]] and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.

The second phase of postmodernity is defined {{By whom|date=December 2017}} by "[[digitality]]" – the increasing power of personal and [[Digital data|digital]] means of communication including fax machines, modems, cable and high speed internet, which has altered the condition of postmodernity dramatically: digital production of information allows individuals to manipulate virtually every aspect of the media environment. This has brought producers into conflict with consumers over [[intellectual capital]] and [[intellectual property]] and led to the creation of a [[new economy]] whose supporters argue that the dramatic fall in information costs will alter society fundamentally.

It began to be argued {{By whom|date=December 2017}} that digitality or what [[Esther Dyson]] referred to as "being digital" had emerged as a separate condition from postmodernity. Those holding this position argued that the ability to manipulate items of popular culture, the World Wide Web, the use of search engines to index knowledge, and telecommunications were producing a "convergence" which would be marked by the rise of "[[participatory culture]]" in the words of [[Henry Jenkins]] and the use of [[media device]]s, such as Apple's [[iPod]].

The simplest, but not necessarily most correct demarcation point of this era is {{according to whom|date = December 2017}} the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the liberalisation of China in 1991. [[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote "The End of History" in 1989 in anticipation of the fall of the Berlin wall. He predicted that the question of political philosophy had been answered, that large scale wars over fundamental values would no longer arise since "all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs satisfied." This is a kind of 'endism' also taken up by [[Arthur Danto]] who in 1984 acclaimed that Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes asked the right question of art and hence art had ended.

=== Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory ===

The debate on postmodernity has two distinct elements that are often confused; (1) the nature of contemporary society and (2) the nature of the critique of contemporary society. The first of these elements is concerned with the nature of changes that took place during the late 20th century. There are three principal analyses. Theorists such as [[Callinicos]] (1991) and [[Craig Calhoun|Calhoun]] (1995) offer a conservative position on the nature of contemporary society, downplaying the significance and extent of socio-economic changes and emphasizing a continuity with the past. Second a range of theorists have tried to analyze the present as a development of the "modern" project into a second, distinct phase that is nevertheless still "modernity": this has been termed the "second" or "risk" society by [[Ulrich Beck]] (1986), "late" or "high" modernity by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Giddens]] (1990, 1991), "liquid" modernity by [[Zygmunt Bauman]] (2000), and the "network" society by [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] (1996, 1997). Third are those who argue that contemporary society has moved into a literally post-modern phase distinct from modernity. The most prominent proponents of this position are [[Lyotard]] and [[Baudrillard]].

Another set of issues concerns the nature of critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[relativism]], where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib (1995) and [[Judith Butler]] (1995) pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an [[Anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] concept of the subject and identity, the [[The End of History and the Last Man|death of history]] and of notions of [[teleology]] and progress, and the death of [[metaphysics]] defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women’s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.

Butler responds to Benhabib by arguing that her use of postmodernism is an expression of a wider paranoia over anti-foundationalist philosophy, in particular, [[poststructuralism]].

{{quote|A number of positions are ascribed to postmodernism – Discourse is all there is, as if discourse were some kind of monistic stuff out of which all things are composed; the subject is dead, I can never say “I” again; there is no reality, only representation.  These characterizations are variously imputed to postmodernism or poststructuralism, which are conflated with each other and sometimes conflated with deconstruction, and understood as an indiscriminate assemblage of French feminism, deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, Foucauldian analysis, Rorty’s conversationalism, and cultural studies ... In reality, these movements are opposed: Lacanian psychoanalysis in France positions itself officially against poststructuralism, that Foucauldian rarely relate to Derridideans ... Lyotard champions the term, but he cannot be made into the example of what all the rest of the purported postmodernists are doing.  Lyotard’s work is, for instance, seriously at odds with that of Derrida}}

Butler uses the debate over the nature of the post-modernist critique to demonstrate how philosophy is implicated in power relationships and defends poststructuralist critique by arguing that the critique of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] itself is the beginning of analysis, not the end,  because the first task of enquiry is the questioning of accepted "universal" and "objective" norms.

The Benhabib-Butler debate demonstrates that there is no simple definition of a postmodern theorist as the very definition of postmodernity itself is contested. [[Michel Foucault]] rejected the label of postmodernism explicitly in interviews yet is seen by many, such as Benhabib, as advocating a form of critique that is "postmodern" in that it breaks with utopian and transcendental "modern" critiques by calling universal norms of the Enlightenment into question. [[Giddens]] (1990) rejects this characterisation of "modern critique", pointing out that a critique of Enlightenment universals was central to philosophers of the modern period, most notably Nietzsche.

=== Postmodern society ===

[[Fredric Jameson|Jameson]] views a number of phenomena as distinguishing postmodernity from modernity. He speaks of "a new kind of [[superficiality]]" or "depthlessness" in which models that once explained people and things in terms of an "inside" and an "outside" (such as [[hermeneutics]], the [[dialectic]], [[Freud]]ian [[Psychological repression|repression]], the [[existentialist]] distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity, and the [[Sign (semiotics)|semiotic]] distinction of signifier and signified) have been rejected.

Second is a rejection of the modernist "[[Utopia]]n gesture", evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a "fundamental mutation" so that it has "now become a set of texts or [[Simulacrum|simulacra]]" (Jameson 1993:38). Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (we might say, following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer in a way that would seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content" (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.

The third feature of the postmodern age that Jameson identifies is the "waning of affect" – not that all [[emotion]] has disappeared from the postmodern age but that it lacks a particular kind of emotion such as that found in "[[Rimbaud]]'s magical flowers 'that look back at you'". He notes that "[[pastiche]] eclipses [[parody]]" as "the increasing unavailability of the personal style" leads to pastiche becoming a universal practice.

Jameson argues that distance "has been abolished" in postmodernity, that we "are submerged in its henceforth filled and suffused volumes to the point where our now postmodern bodies are bereft of spatial co-ordinates". This "new global space" constitutes postmodernity's "moment of truth". The various other features of the postmodern that he identifies "can all now be seen as themselves partial (yet constitutive) aspects of the same general spatial object". The postmodern era has seen a change in the [[Structural functionalism|social function]] of culture. He identifies culture in the modern age as having had a property of "semi-autonomy", with an "existence… above the practical world of the existent" but, in the postmodern age, culture has been deprived of this autonomy, the cultural has expanded to consume the entire social realm so that all becomes "cultural". "Critical distance", the assumption that culture can be positioned outside "the massive Being of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" upon which left-wing theories of cultural politics are dependent, has become outmoded. The "prodigious new expansion of multinational capital ends up penetrating and colonizing those very pre-capitalist enclaves (Nature and the Unconscious) which offered extraterritorial and [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] footholds for critical effectivity". (Jameson 1993:54)

=== Social sciences ===

[[History of sociology#20th Century: Critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival|Postmodern sociology]] can be said to focus on conditions of life which became increasingly prevalent in the late 20th century in the most industrialized nations, including the ubiquity of mass media and mass production, the rise of a global economy and a shift from manufacturing to [[service economy|service economies]]. Jameson and Harvey described it as [[consumerism]], where manufacturing, distribution and dissemination have become exceptionally inexpensive but social connectedness and community have become rarer. Other thinkers assert that postmodernity is the natural reaction to mass broadcasting in a society conditioned to mass production and mass politics. The work of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] informs the versions of postmodernism elaborated by such authors as Murphy (2003) and Bielskis (2005), for whom MacIntyre's postmodern revision of [[Aristotelianism]] poses a challenge to the kind of consumerist ideology that now promotes capital accumulation.

The sociological view of postmodernity ascribes it to more rapid transportation, wider communication and the ability to abandon standardization of mass production, leading to a system which values a wider range of capital than previously and allows value to be stored in a greater variety of forms. Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from "[[Fordism]]", a term coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]] to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Fordism for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. [[Post-fordism]] is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey's point of view.

[[Social artifact|Artifacts]] of postmodernity include the dominance of [[television]] and [[popular culture]], the wide accessibility of information and mass telecommunications. Postmodernity also exhibits a greater resistance to making sacrifices in the name of progress discernible in [[environmentalism]] and the growing importance of the [[anti-war]] movement. Postmodernity in the industrialised core is marked by increasing focus on [[civil rights]] and [[equal opportunity]] as well as movements such as [[feminism]] and [[multiculturalism]] and the backlash against these movements. The postmodern political sphere is marked by multiple arenas and possibilities of citizenship and [[political action]] concerning various forms of struggle against oppression or alienation (in collectives defined by sex or ethnicity) while the modernist political arena remains restricted to class struggle.

Theorists such as [[Michel Maffesoli]] believe that postmodernity is corroding the circumstances that provide for its subsistence and will eventually result in a decline of individualism and the birth of a new [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-Tribal]] era.

According to theories of postmodernity, [[economic]] and [[technological]] conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only [[simulacra]], inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in [[communication]], [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]], is often{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that [[Intersubjectivity|inter-subjective]], not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of [[discourse]] under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.

In ''Spaces of Hope'' Harvey argues that postmodern political movements have been indirectly responsible for weakening class issues (in the Marxist sense) and the critical consciousness of this field of action which, in his opinion, is now more significant than during the Fordist period. For Harvey this [[class conflict]] is far from solved (something postmodern theorists ignore, according to his argument): globalization has made it more difficult for labour organisations to tackle underpaid work in poor conditions without labour rights and the amount of surplus value earned by corporations is far larger because of the differential between the high prices paid by western consumers and the low wages earned by south-east Asian labourers.

=== Postmodernity as a shift of epistemology ===
Another conceptualization has argued that postmodernity might be best described within the framework of epistemological [[paradigm shift|shifts]]. This argument presupposes that epistemological shifts occur as a result of changes in culture, society, and technology and suggests that the political, cultural, and technological changes of the 1960s and 1970s stimulated an epistemological shift from modernity to postmodernity. Or said differently, the ways in which people communicate, receive, and justify knowledge (i.e. epistemology) change and these changes are argued to broadly influence cultures, worldviews, and people groups.

== Criticisms ==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of the postmodern condition can broadly be put into four categories: criticisms of postmodernity from the perspective of those who reject [[modernism]] and its offshoots, criticisms from supporters of [[modernism]] who believe that postmodernity lacks crucial characteristics of the modern project, critics from within postmodernity who seek reform or change based on their understanding of [[postmodernism]], and those who believe that postmodernity is a passing, and not a growing, phase in social organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25597">The '''pre-Adamite hypothesis''' or '''pre-adamism''' is the [[theological]] belief that humans (or intelligent yet non-human creatures) existed before the biblical character [[Adam]]. Pre-adamism is therefore distinct from the conventional Jewish, Christian or Muslim belief that Adam was the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first human]]. Advocates of this hypothesis are known as "pre-Adamites", along with the humans who they believe existed before Adam.

==Early development==
[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]]  ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' contains two chapters indicating a debate between Christians and pagans over human origins: Book XII, chapter 10 is titled "Of the falseness of the history that the world hath continued many thousand years" and the title of book XVIII, chapter 40 is "The Egyptians' abominable lyings, to claim their wisdom the age of 100,000 years". The titles indicate that Augustine saw pagan ideas concerning both the history of the world and the chronology of the human race as incompatible with the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. Augustine’s position on this matter was supported by most rabbis and by the church fathers, who generally dismissed views on the antiquity of the world as myths and fables not requiring any considered refutation.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, 1992, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==900 – 1700==
In early [[Islam]], a common belief held that mankind is actually the successor of other intelligent creatures such as [[Jinn]] and [[Hinn (mythology)|Hinn]]. Medieval Muslim traditions often referred to the Jinn as ''pre-Adamites'',&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 39&lt;/ref&gt; depicted as human-like in various ways. Although the notion of Jinn as pre-adamites was generally accepted, the idea that before the known [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] there lived other humans was a controversial one. From the mid-ninth century onwards the idea appeared, that [[God in Islam|God]] created several Adams each of whom presides over an era lasting around 50.000 years. Although these conceptions was regarded as heretic by most Muslims, it was widely accepted by [[Ismailism|Ismailis]] and [[Sufism|Sufis]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone ''Islam, the Ancient Near East and Varieties of Godlessness: Collected Studies in Three Volumes, Band 3'' BRILL 2016 {{ISBN|978-9-004-31931-8}} page 230-231&lt;/ref&gt; 

A book titled ''Nabatean Agriculture'', written or translated by [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] in 904, collated texts about the activities and beliefs of Arabic groups such as the [[Nabataeans]], in defence of [[Babylonia]]n culture against [[Islam]]. The book discussed the ideas that people lived before Adam, that he had parents, and that he came from [[India]].{{sfn|Livingstone|2011|p=7}}{{sfn|Popkin|1987|p=28}}

The [[Jews|Jewish]] poet [[Yehuda Halevi]] wrote his [[Kitab al Khazari]] between 1130 and 1140, featuring a discussion where the King of the [[Khazars]] questioned three theologians (a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[Christian]], and a [[Muslim]]) which was the true religion, and raised the challenge that people in [[India]] said they had buildings and antiquities which were [[Dating Creation|millions of years old]]. The rabbi responded that his faith was unshaken, as the Indians lacked "a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found." The rabbi dismissed Indians as dissolute, unreliable people, whose claims could be ignored. Later in the book, Halevi rejected the ''Nabatean'' claims as these people did not know of the [[revelation]] in [[Scripture]], and he dismissed Greek theories of an eternal world. In his conclusion, Halevi maintained that Adam was the first human in this world but left open other possibilities: "If, after all, a believer in the Law finds himself compelled to admit an eternal matter and the existence of many worlds prior to this one, this would not impair his belief that this world was created at a certain epoch, and that Adam and Noah were the first human beings."{{sfn|Popkin|1987|pp=27–28}}

The claims in ''Nabatean Agriculture'' were also disputed by [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) in ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''. He attributed the concepts to the [[Sabians]] and said they were just legends and mythology which deviated from monotheism though drawing on Jewish sources, but in refuting the speculations, he circulated an outline of the ideas among other scholars:{{sfn|Livingstone|2011|pp=7–8}} "They deem ''Adam'' to have been an individual born of male and female like any other human individuals, but they glorify him and say that he was a prophet, the envoy of the moon, who called people to worship the moon. and there are compilations of his on how to cultivate the soil." He noted the claim that Adam came from India, and went on to Babylon.{{sfn|Popkin|1987|pp=29–30}}

The presence of a belief in the existence of men before Adam among the [[Familia Caritatis|Familists]], a religious community in [[Friesland]], was noted by John Rogers in 1578.&lt;ref&gt;Almond, 1999, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1591, [[Giordano Bruno]] argued that, because no one could imagine that the [[Jews]] and the [[Ethiopia]]ns had the same ancestry, God must have either created separate Adams or that Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamic races.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century French [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isaac La Peyrère]], because of his influence on subsequent thinkers and movements, is usually credited with formulating the pre-Adamite theory. In his ''Prae-Adamitae'', published in Latin in 1655, La Peyrère argued that Paul's words in {{bibleref2|Romans|5:12-14|NIV}} should be interpreted to mean that "if [[Adam]] sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people."&lt;ref&gt;Almond, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to La Peyrère, there must have been two creations; first the creation of the [[Gentiles]] and then the creation of Adam, who was the father of the [[Hebrews]]. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyrère argued, explained [[Cain]]'s taking of a wife and the building of a city after [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s murder in the [[Book of Genesis]]. This account of human origins became the basis for 19th century theories of [[polygenism]] and modern [[racism]].{{cn|date=February 2014}}

Some{{who|date=February 2014}} date the origins of the racial theory precisely to 24 April 1684, when [[François Bernier]] distinguished four or five [[race (human classification)|race]]s (with no [[hierarchical]] distinction between them) in an article titled ("A new division of the Earth, according to the different species or races of men who inhabit it") published in the ''[[Journal des sçavans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The full title of the paper was "Nouvelle Division De La Terre, pour les differente Especes ou Races d'hommes qui l'habitent, envoyée par un fameux voyageur à M. l'Abbé de la **** à peu prés on ces termes", ''Journal des sçavans'', 24 April 1684, pp. 133-140. The title is slightly different in the 1685 reprint in ''Journal des sçavans pour l'année M.DC.XXXIV'', pp. 148-155 - see Boulle, 2003, pp. 11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread theological opposition to the pre-Adamite theories of his friend La Peyrère, Bernier published his paper anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, 2003, pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Enlightenment==
{{See also|Curse and mark of Cain}}
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], pre-Adamism was adopted widely as a challenge to the biblical account of human origins.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In the 19th century, the idea was welcomed by advocates of [[white supremacy|white superiority]]. A number of racist interpretive frameworks involving the early chapters of Genesis arose from pre-Adamism. Some pre-Adamite theorists held the view that Cain left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as "white [[Mongols]]" or that Cain took a wife from one of the inferior pre-Adamic peoples.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

== In Sufism ==
Various Sufis, especially [[Sultan Bahu]], a famous 17th-century mystic of the [[Qadiriyya]], a [[Sufi]] order, advocated this theory. In one of his writings, he wrote, "Once God said to the Prophet "O Muhammad I created an Adam before I created your father Adam, whom I gave a life of thousand years. Then I created fifteen thousand Adams all of whom I gave a life of ten thousand years. After that I created your Adam."&lt;ref&gt; Ain ul Faqr by [[Sultan Bahu]], p. 285 &lt;/ref&gt;

According to that statement, the pre-Adamic era lasted for 150,100,000 years.

==1800 – present==
===Racist pre-Adamism===
In 19th century Europe, pre-Adamism was attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, and in the [[United States]], it appealed to those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-whites.

Scientists such as [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[Samuel George Morton|Samuel G. Morton]] rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with [[craniometry|cranial measurements]]. As Michael Barkun explains:
{{quote|In such an intellectual atmosphere, pre-Adamism appeared in two different but not wholly incompatible forms. Religious writers continued to be attracted to the theory both because it appeared to solve certain [[exegesis|exegetical]] problems (where did Cain's wife come from?) and exalted the spiritual status of Adam's descendants. Those of a scientific bent found it equally attractive but for different reasons, connected with a desire to formulate theories of racial difference that retained a place for Adam while accepting evidence that many cultures were far older than the few thousand years that humanity had existed, according to the biblical chronology. The two varieties differed primarily in the evidence they used, the one relying principally on scriptural texts and the latter on what passed at the time for [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, 1996, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1860, [[Isabelle Wight Duncan|Isabella Duncan]]&lt;ref&gt;Some editions of the book are attributed to Mrs George John C. Duncan.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture &amp; Science'', a mixture of [[geology]] and scriptural interpretation. The book was popular among a number of geologists because it mixed biblical events with science. She suggested that the pre-Adamites are today's [[angel]]s. Since they were without [[sin]], for sin did not enter the world until Adam disobeyed God, there was no reason for them not to have been at least [[rapture]]d into [[heaven]], anticipating what would again occur with the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus Christ]]. Duncan also believed that some angels had sinned and fallen from [[Heaven]], which caused them to become [[demon]]s. Duncan supposed that such an upheaval would leave geological scars on the earth. The concept of [[ice age]]s, pioneered by [[Louis Agassiz]], seemed to provide evidence of such events, drawing the line between the pre-Adamic era and the modern one, which she posited began about 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Isabella Duncan, Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture &amp; Science, 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Civil War]], Southerners were increasingly receptive to arguments that supported their belief in black inferiority. In 1867, [[Buckner H. Payne]], under the pen name Ariel, wrote a pamphlet, ''The Negro: What is His Ethnological Status?'' He argued that the Negro is a pre-Adamic beast of the field (specifically, a higher order of monkey), which was preserved on [[Noah's Ark]]. In 1891, William Campbell, under the pen name "Caucasian", wrote in ''Anthropology for the People: A Refutation of the Theory of the Adamic Origin of All Races'' that the non-white peoples were not descendants of Adam and therefore "not brothers in any proper sense of the term, but inferior creations" and that [[polygenism]] was the "only theory reconcilable with scripture."

Following Payne, Campbell viewed the [[flood geology|Great Flood]] as a consequence of intermarriage between the white (Adamic) and nonwhite (pre-Adamic) peoples "the only union we can think of that is reasonable and sufficient to account for the corruption of the world and the consequent judgement."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Harvey, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lester A Hoyle wrote a book in 1875, ''The Pre-Adamite, or who tempted Eve?'' He claimed that there had been five distinct creations of races, and only the fifth, the white race, of which [[Adam]] was the father, had been made in God’s own image and likeness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre-Adamism, the [[Vanderbilt University]] [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolutionist]] and [[geology|geologist]] [[Alexander Winchell (geologist)|Alexander Winchell]] argued in his 1878 tract, ''Adamites and Preadamites'', for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race, on the basis that the Negroes were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish lawyer [[Dominick McCausland]], a Biblical literalist and anti-Darwinian polemicist, maintained the theory to uphold the Mosaic timescale. He held that the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] were descended from Cain and that the "Caucasian" race would eventually exterminate all others. He maintained that only the "Caucasian" descendants of Adam were capable of creating civilisation, and he tried to explain away the numerous non-"Caucasian" civilisations by attributing them all to a vanished "Caucasian" race, the Hamites.&lt;ref&gt;Dominick M'Causland, The Builders of Babel, 1871; Patrick Maume “Dominick McCausland and Adam’s Ancestors: an Irish Evangelical responds to the Scientific Challenge to Biblical Inerrancy” in Juliana Adelman and Eadaoin Agnew (eds) Science and Technology in Nineteenth-Century Ireland (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Charles Carroll (racist)|Charles Carroll]] wrote ''The Negro a Beast; or, In the Image of God''. He concludes in the book that the [[white race]] was made in the image and likeness of God and that Adam gave birth to only the white race, and Negros are pre-Adamite beasts, who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beastlike, [[Immorality|immoral]] and [[Beauty#Ugliness|ugly]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carroll The negro a beast"; or, "In the image of God"; the reasoner of the age, the revelator of the century! The Bible as it is! The negro and his relation to the human family! The negro not the son of Ham, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races, such as blacks, did not have souls. Carroll believed that race mixing was an insult to God and spoiled God's racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of [[atheism]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600 – 2000'', 2006, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish millennialist George Dickison wrote ''The Mosaic Account of Creation, As Unfolded in Genesis, Verified by Science'' in 1902. The book mixed science with a scientifically enhanced reading of Genesis and lists geological discoveries that showed that men existed before Adam had been created and that Earth was much older than the 6000-year-old span of the Adamic race. Dickison welcomed scientific discoveries from fossil evidence and the palaontological record and used them as evidence for pre-Adamism.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 – 2000, 2006, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Kardec]], the founder of [[Spiritualism]] taught [[polygenism]] and that the earth was populated "from time immemorial" and that the Adamic race has "pushed all other races forward".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kardecpedia.com.br/en/study-guide/888/genesis-the-miracles-and-the-predictions-according-to-spiritism/3907/genesis/chapter-xi-spiritual-genesis/the-adamic-race&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oconsolador.com.br/linkfixo/bibliotecavirtual/ingles/Genesis.pdf Genesis&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine known as [[British Israelism]], which developed in [[England]] in the 19th century, also sometimes included a pre-Adamic worldview but that was a minority position. The model viewed pre-Adamites as a race of inferior bestial creatures apart from Adam, who was the first white man and consequently the first son of God. In the narrative, [[Satan]] seduces Eve, and the resulting offspring is a hybrid creature, Cain. Later, Cain flees to [[East Turkestan]] to establish a colony of followers intent on realizing the Devil’s plan for domination of the earth. A further elaboration of this myth involved the identification of the [[Jews]] with the [[Canaanites]], the putative descendants of Cain, but the [[eponym]]ous ancestor of the Canaanites is not Cain but [[Canaan]]. It followed that if the [[tribe of Judah|tribes of Judah]] were supposed to have intermarried with Cain’s descendants, the Jews were both the offspring of Satan and the descendents of sundry nonwhite pre-Adamic races.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun, Religion and the racist right: the origins of the Christian Identity movement, pp. 150–172&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, British Israelism developed into the aggressively [[anti-Semitic]] [[Christian Identity]] movement in which the Jews were "mongrelized" [[serpent seed]].

===Non-racist pre-Adamism===
Non-racist pre-Adamism can be traced back to [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], an [[occultist]]. Paschal was of [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry and was a spokesman against [[slavery]]. Paschal believed in Pre-Adamism and wrote ''Pre-Adamite Man: Demonstrating The Existence of the Human Race Upon the Earth 100,000 Thousand Years Ago!'' under the name Griffin Lee in 1863. The book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it was not based on only biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, [[esoteric]]a and ancient religions. In the book, Paschal claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 to 100,000 years ago. His book is different from many of the other writings by other pre-Adamite authors because Randolph claimed that the pre-Adamites were civilised men, but other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or (not fully human) [[hominids]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal Beverly Randolph, Pre-Adamite man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!, 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Adamite theories have also been held by a number of mainstream Christians such as the [[Congregational Church|Congregational]] evangelist [[R. A. Torrey]] (1856–1928), who believed in the [[Gap creationism|Gap Theory]] and that pre-Adamites had survived into the present day.

[[Gleason Archer]] was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote in his 1985 book, ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction'', "To revert to the problem of the [[Pithecanthropus]], the [[Swanscombe]] man, the [[Neanderthal]] and all the rest (possibly even the [[Cro-Magnon|Cro-magnon]] man, who is apparently to be classed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', but whose remains seem to date back at least to 20,000 B.C.) it seems best to regard these races as all prior to Adam’s time, and not involved in the Adamic covenant. We must leave the question open, in view of the cultural remains, whether these pre-Adamic creatures had souls (or, to use the trichotomic terminology, spirits)." 

Gleason went on to assert that only Adam and his descendants were infused with the breath of God and a spiritual nature corresponding to God himself, and he said that all mankind subsequent to Adam’s time must have been literally descended from him. However, he retains the concept of pre-Adamic races (such as the [[Cro-Magnon]] man), and says: "They may have been exterminated by God for unknown reasons prior to the creation of the original parent of the present human race".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, G. Jr., A Survey of Old Testament Introduction, Revised edition, Moody Press, Chicago, pp. 204–205, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grigg |first=Russell |url=http://creation.mobi/article/453 |title=Pre-Adamic man: were there human beings on Earth before Adam? |publisher=Creation.mobi |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, such ideas have been promoted by [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] and [[Derek Prince]] among [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[John Stott]] among [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and [[Old Earth Creationism|Old Earth creationist]] [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Taylor |url=http://www.creationmoments.com/content/pre-adamic-man |title=Pre-Adamic Man |publisher=Creation Moments |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Velikovsky]] was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote ''In the Beginning''. In the book, Velikovsky describes catastrophes that had occurred before those described in his first book, ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. In the first section, his chapter ''The Pre-Adamite Age'' discusses pre-Adamism. He wrote that the "talmudic-rabbinical tradition believed that before Adam was created, the world was more than once inhabited and more than once destroyed." Moreover, he wrote that according to the evidence from many different traditions, Adam and Eve were not a single human pair and there must have been many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varchive.org/itb/ecadam.htm |title=The Pre-Adamite Age |publisher=Varchive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23520">'''Public history''' is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of [[history]] who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[archival science]], [[oral history]], museum [[curator]]ship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are [[museums]], historic homes and [[historic site]]s, parks, battlefields, [[archives]],  film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Definition==
Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined.  Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians:
* use of the methods of the historical discipline
* an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or [[antiquarian]] purposes
* an emphasis on professional training and practice
* an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past

These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based [[National Council on Public History]]:  "To promote the utility of history in social through professional practice.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncph.org/Portals/13/About%20the%20Council/NCPHsFirstDecade.pdf Reflections on an Idea: NCPH’s First Decade]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;69–85&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, "Public history is a movement,  methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public."  However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncph.org/WhatisPublicHistory/tabid/282/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Public History Redux"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Public History News'' (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if [[shared historical authority]] should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many "publics" for public history complicates the task of definition.  For example, historian [[Peter Novick]] has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called ''private'' history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or ''popular'' history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream:  The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' (1988), 510-21&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Stanton, '' The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Kean]] and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between "historians" and "their publics"'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), ''People and their Pasts: Public History Today'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0909/0909pub1.cfm "A Picture of Public History]:  Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals" in ''Public History News'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, those who embrace the term ''public historian'' accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings.

==Related fields==

Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/3-2015-2/public-history-sublation-german-debate/ Marko Demantowsky, ''“Public History” – Sublation of a German Debate?'', Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include:
* [[Applied history]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Cultural Heritage Management]]
* [[Digital History]]
* [[Heritage Interpretation]]
* [[Historic Preservation]]
* [[Historical archaeology]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Oral History]]
* [[Public humanities]]

In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making.  This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be "public history."

==History==

Public history has many antecedents.  These include [[Museum#History museums|history museums]],  [[Historical society|historical societies]],  public and private [[archive]]s and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, [[Historic preservation|preservation organizations]], historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, [[historical fiction]]).  Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmilla Jordanova, ''The Practice of History'' (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''Public History Review'', vol 10, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Historians in Public:  the Practice of American History, 1890-1970'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, ''Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History'' (Iowa City:  University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as “public history”. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups—for example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities—rather than the  [[Great man theory|“great men”]] who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced [[social history]] as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.&lt;ref&gt;James Green, ''Taking History to Heart:  The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements'' (Amherst, Massachusetts:  [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'', p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the [[United States Bicentennial]] to multiculturalist projects in [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]], paralleled by widespread public interest in [[genealogy]], the tracing of folk and family [[Roots revival|“roots”]], and other history-related activities. In the wake of [[deindustrialization]] in many industrial places, governments also supported [[Urban renewal|regeneration or revitalization projects]] that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for [[place branding|“re-branding”]] a depressed area.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Dicks, ''Culture on Display:  The Production of Contemporary Visitability'' (Maidenhead, UK:  Open University Press, 2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] and the Canadian government's addition of “historical researcher” as a civil service category in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;John R. English, "The Tradition of Public History in Canada," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rise of [[cultural tourism]] and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field.

In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wesley Johnson, "The Origins of ''The Public Historian'' and the National Council on Public History," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of “public history” as a field in its own right.  Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field.  The launch of a professional journal, ''[[The Public Historian]]'', in 1978, and the founding of the [[National Council on Public History]] in 1979 further served to give public-minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods.

Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic “jobs crisis” in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.&lt;ref&gt;English, "Tradition of Public History in Canada"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick, "Public History in Canada:  An Introduction," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Public history also exists as an identifiable field in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]] and Paula Hamilton, “What Makes History Public?” ''Public History Review'' 1992, pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Liddington, "What is Public History?  Publics and Their Pasts, Meanings and Practices," ''Oral History'' (Spring 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. Sutcliffe, "Gleams and Echoes of Public History in Western Europe:  Before and After the Rotterdam Conference," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 6, No. 4 (Fall 1984), pp. 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; and other places. In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Public History Network|url=http://www.historiapublica.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label “public history.”  The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifph.hypotheses.org International Federation for Public History - Fédération Internationale pour l'Histoire Publique]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/PHN-2012-September1.pdf Serge Noiret: Next Steps for the International Federation, Public History News, Volume 32, Number 4, September 2012, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; IFPH is also a permanent &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html#public Internal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203723/http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal ''[[Public History Weekly]]''.

Public history continues to develop and define itself.  There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with [[digital history]], with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge.  In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual [http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=105 NCPH Book Award].  In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians’ sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn Létourneau, and David Northrup, "Canadians and Their Pasts:  An Exploration in Historical Consciousness," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  While high-profile “history wars” have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, [[History wars|Australia's]] ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples,  the furor over [[Jack Granatstein]]’s 1998 book “Who Killed Canadian History?”, or the 1994 controversy over the [[National Museum of American History]]'s planned exhibit on the [[Enola Gay#Recent developments|Enola Gay]] bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings.

An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like [[If This House Could Talk]] are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html  |title= Connecting Neighbors through their buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Quantitative history''' is an approach to [[history|historical research]] that makes use of [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], [[statistical]] and [[computer]] tools. It is considered a branch of ''social science history'' and has four leading journals: ''Historical Methods'' (1967- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heldref.org/hm.php Historical Methods online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043317/http://www.heldref.org/hm.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]'' (1968- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jih/ Journal of Interdisciplinary History online]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Social Science History'' (1976- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/ Social Science History online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''] (2010- ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative historians start with databases. Large quantities of economic and demographic data are available in print format. Quantifiers move these into computerized databases. The largest repository is the [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]] (ICPSR) at the [[University of Michigan]], which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the [[United States]] and the world.

== Data bases: economic ==

[[Economic historian]]s use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

''[[Content analysis]]'' is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby newspapers, magazines or similar sources are numerically coded according to a standardized list of topics. [Neuendorf, ''The Content Analysis Guidebook'' (2002)]

== Political history ==

Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.  '''Collective biography'' uses standardized information on a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

== New social history ==

The "new [[social historian]]s" (new in the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, and migrations and population changes.

An especially challenging technique is linking names ("nominal record linkage") of the same person whose information appears in multiple source such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

== Cliodynamics ==
[[Cliodynamics]] employs a scientific approach to the study of history and combines insights from [[cultural evolution]], [[macrosociology]], and [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]] to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

== Topics ==

'''''The Arctic Home in the Vedas''''' is a book on the origin of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryanic People]] by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], a mathematician turned [[astronomer]], historian, journalist, philosopher and political leader of India. It propounded the idea that the [[North Pole]] was the original home of Aryans during the pre-glacial period which they had to leave due to the ice deluge around [[8th millennium BC|8000 B.C.]] and had to migrate to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands for new settlements. In support to his theory, Tilak presented certain [[Vedic]] hymns, [[Avestic]] passages, Vedic chronology and Vedic calendars with interpretations of the contents in detail.

The book was written at the end of 1898, but was first published in March 1903 in [[Pune]].

==Background==
Man was believed to be post-[[glacial]], and the theory of an Asiatic origin of the Aryan peoples prevailed. The age of the oldest Vedic period, however, was carried back to 4500 BC by scholars including the author himself after scientific astronomical research in correlation with the evidence found in the Vedic hymns.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Tilak cites a book by [[William Fairfield Warren|William F. Warren]], the first President of [[Boston University]], ''Paradise Found or the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole'', as having anticipated his ideas to some extent. Warren dedicated his book to [[Max Müller]], with whom Tilak had shared ideas before the book{{clarify|reason=Tilak's book or Warren's?|date=July 2016}} was completed.

Tilak held the view that further study of Vedic hymns and Avestan passages might reveal the long vista of primitive Aryan antiquity.

==Summary of Tilak’s polar theory==
*[[Neolithic]] Aryan race in Europe cannot be regarded as [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]], nor European Aryans descended from the [[Paleolithic]] man. Hence, question of the original Aryan home is still unsettled.
*In the early geological ages, the [[Alps]] were low, the [[Himalayas]] not yet upheaved, Asia and Africa were represented only by a group of islands and an equable and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface of the globe. In those days, however, a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic region.
*The close of the [[Pliocene]] and the whole of the [[Pleistocene]] period were marked by violent changes of climate bringing on what is called the Glacial and Inter-Glacial epochs. A succession of cold and warm climates must have characterized these Glacial and Inter-Glacial periods which were also accompanied by extensive movements of depression and elevation of land, the depression taking place after the land was weighed down with the enormous mass of ice.
*Thus a period of glaciations was marked by elevation, extreme cold and the invasion of the ice-caps over regions of the present Temperate zone; while an inter-glacial period was accompanied by depression of land and milder and congenial climate which made even the Arctic regions habitable.
*According to the latest geological evidence, the last Glacial period must have closed and Post-Glacial must have commenced at about 10,000 years ago or 8,000 BC. There were at least two Glacial and one Inter-Glacial period, and the geographical distribution of land and water on the earth during the Inter-Glacial period was quite different from what it is at present. It was the coming on of the Glacial age that destroyed this genial climate and rendered the regions unsuited for the habitation of tropical plants and animals.
*At the North Pole, one sees the heavenly dome above seems to revolve around one like a [[potter's wheel]]. The stars will not rise and set but move round and round in horizontal planes during the long night of six months. The [[Sun]], when it is above the horizon for six months; would also appear to revolve in the same way but with some difference. The Northern celestial hemisphere will alone be visible spinning round and round and the Southern half remain invisible. The Sun going into the Northern hemisphere in his annual course will appear as coming up from the South. Living in the temperate and tropical zones, however, one sees all heavenly objects rise in the East and set in the West, some passing over the head, others traveling obliquely.
*The long dawn of two months is a special and important characteristic of the North Pole. As we descend southward, the splendor and the duration of the dawn will be witnessed on a less and less magnificent scale. But the dawn occurring at the end of the long night of two, three or more months will still be unusually long, often of several days duration.
*All these characteristics of an Arctic home are clearly recorded in several Vedic hymns and Avestic passages and they come to us sometimes as the description of the prevailing conditions or the day-to-day experience or stories told by the earlier generation and sometimes as [[myths]].

==Chronology of the post-glacial period==
[[File:Lokmanya.jpg|thumb|Tilak in his Study]]
*10,000 to 8000 BC – The destruction of the original Arctic home by the last [[Ice Age]] and the commencement of the post-Glacial period.
*8000 to 5000 BC – The age of migration from the original home. The survivors of the Aryan race roamed over the northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands suitable for new settlements. Tilak calls it the ''Pre-Orion Period''.
*5000 to 3000 BC. -  The Orion period, when the vernal equinox was in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Many Vedic hymns can be traced to the early part of this period and the [[bards]] of the race seem to have not yet forgotten the real importance of the traditions of the Arctic home inherited by them. It was at this time that first attempts to reform the calendar and the [[sacrificial]] system appear to have been systematically made.
*3000 to 1400 BC – The ''[[Krittika]]'' period, when the [[Vernal equinox]] was in [[Pleiades]]. The traditions about the original Arctic home had grown dim by this time and were often misunderstood, making the Vedic hymns less and less intelligible.
*1400 to 500 BC – The Pre-Buddhistic period, when the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] and the Philosophical systems made their appearance.

'''''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation''''', written by [[John M. Hobson]] in 2004, is a [[book]] that argues against the [[historical]] [[theory]] of the [[Great Divergence|rise of the West]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|after 1492]] as a "virgin birth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = John M. | title = The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 5 July 2004 | pages = 11, 102, 296 | isbn = 978-0-521-54724-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather as a product of Western interactions with more technically and socially advanced [[Eastern world|Eastern civilization]].

The text reinterprets [[Eurocentric]] ideas of Europe's contributions to world development. For example, it provides evidence that a complex system of [[global trade]] existed long before [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist Europe]], that social and economic theories in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] came from encounters with new cultures rather than with [[Renaissance|Greek and Roman heritage]], and that modern European hegemony resulted from situational advantages rather than from inherent superior traits.

==Key ideas==

* Many inventions critical to European progress were Chinese innovations.
* Europeans appropriated many Eastern resources such as land, labour and markets through imperialism.
* European powers did not create world trade, but rather used American silver to integrate into bustling Indian and Chinese markets.
* The belief that European hegemony derived from free trade, reasoned rule, and democracy is a patriotic myth. European powers won trading rights by force, and Britain developed the industrial revolution under harsh regulations.
* Cultural movements and ideas were spurred by contact with the outside world, particularly with the East.

==Response==

A reviewer for the Culture Mandala wrote Hobson's work "complements and builds on the insights of [[Andre Gunder Frank|Frank]], [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]] and others to illustrate in great detail both how substantial China's historical achievement has been and how much the West has distorted history to serve the purpose of its imperial civilizing mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Little | first = Reg | title = Review of John M. Hobson The Eastern origins of Western civilization | journal = The Culture Mandala | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | date = December 2007 | url = http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cm/vol7/iss1/6/ | issn = 1322-6916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hall of [[McGill University]], writing in the English Historical Review, claims that Hobson's work is prone to wild exaggerations and "tends to cite only those parts of an author’s work that agree with his argument, and misses out whole realms of scholarship". Hobson, Hall continues, "tends to give us bad sociology," and his construct of Eurocentrism is "often a straw man." Generally, Hall remarks that Hobson makes "odd claims," such as asserting that "[[Adam Smith]] depended upon Chinese intellectual discoveries". Hall claims that Hobson's "general picture seems to fail".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John A. Review of &lt;u&gt;The Eastern Origins of Western Civilization&lt;/u&gt;.

'''''The Lost Tomb of Jesus''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in [[Canada]] on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], while [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. (Jacobovici and Cameron had previously created ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]''.)  The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book's claims are the subject of controversy within the [[archaeologists|archaeological]] and [[theologians|theological]] fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars.

==Content==
The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of [[Jesus]]. The film states that ten [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen.

The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it "never before reported information" and that he had published all the details in the journal ''Antiqot'' in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family.&lt;ref  name=cnsnews&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/jesus-tomb-filmmakers-should-be-ashamed-archeologist-says "'Jesus Tomb' Filmmakers Should Be Ashamed, Archeologist Says"]&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is very unserious [sic] work. I do scholarly work…," Kloner said. "[This film] is all nonsense."&lt;ref  name=cnsnews/&gt;

Religious Scholar Provides Insight On The Controversy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As translated in ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' and ''The Jesus Family Tomb'', they read as follows:

* ''Yeshua bar Yehosef' -- [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "Jesus son of Joseph"
* ''Maria''—written in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], but a [[Latin]] form of the Hebrew name "Miriam" ("Mary")&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/us/27jesus.html?em&amp;ex=1172725200&amp;en=cf806e5e644ad636&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=Crypt Held Bodies of Jesus and Family, Film Says |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yose''—a diminutive of "Joseph" mentioned (in its Greek form ιωσης "Joses") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}})
* ''Yehuda bar Yeshua''—possibly Aramaic for "Judah son of Jesus"
* ''Mariamene e Mara''—according to the filmmakers this is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "Mary known as the master." The similar name "[[Mariamne (name)|Mariamne]]" is found in the [[Acts of Philip]]. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at [[Harvard University]] has said, based on his study of that work, "I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=656 Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Matya''—Hebrew for 'Matthew'—''not'' claimed to be [[Matthew the Evangelist]] but "possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt;

The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the [[James Ossuary]] purported to contain the body of [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus: Explore the Evidence |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227110330/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', [[Simcha Jacobovici]] claims the [[James Ossuary]] would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately (citation needed). The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and [[Oded Golan]], one of its past owners, was charged with fraud in connection to the artifact, but exonerated on all counts of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antiquities collector acquitted of forgery charges in 'James ossuary' case|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/|website = The Globe and Mail|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington III]], who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds:
*"The James Ossuary, according to the report of the antiquities dealer that [[Oded Golan]] got the ossuary from, said that the ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not Talpiot, and had dirt in it that matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem."
*"Furthermore, [[Eusebius]] reports that the tomb marker for James's burial was close to where James was martyred near the temple mount, indeed near the famous tombs in the [[Kidron Valley]] such as the so-called [[Yad Avshalom|Tomb of Absalom]]. Talpiot is nowhere near this locale."&lt;ref name=witherington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/02/jesus-tomb-titanic-talpiot-tomb-theory.html |title= The Jesus Tomb? 'Titanic' Talpiot Tomb Theory Sunk from the Start |last=Witherington |first=Ben |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) long by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters (10 inches) on the other end (citation needed). The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) long by 26 centimeters (10.2 inches) by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) (citation needed). Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription.&lt;ref name=cnsnews/&gt; Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the [[Rockefeller Museum]] who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site (citation needed).

New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters (19.6 inches), rather than the length. The top length of the James Ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest re-measurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters (22.6 inches.) (citation needed). While compelling, this does not prove that the James Ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary.

==DNA tests==
Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] performed by [[Lakehead University]] on the remains found in the ossuary marked "Jesus son of Joseph" and the one marked "Mariamne" or "Mary" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/arts/television/03stan.html | work=New York Times | title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus | date=2007-03-03 | accessdate=2011-12-07 | first1=Alessandra | last1=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that "Jesus" and "Mariamne" were probably married "because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the remains were not dated using [[Carbon 14|radiocarbon]] to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=649 Society of Biblical Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the [[Bride of Christ (theology)|"Bride of Christ"]] (found in the writings of the New Testament). [[Jimmy Akin]], director of Apologetics and Evangelization at [[Catholic Answers]], wrote: "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [the wives of religion founders] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." As for a possible "son of Jesus," he noted: "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmyakin.typepad.com/defensor_fidei/2007/03/tomb_of_jesus_n.html |first=Jimmy |last=Akin |title=The Tomb of Jesus Nonsense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers denied that the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of [[Christianity]], such as the [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm?ls|title=Jesus tomb found, says film-maker|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-03-05 | date=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/theological_considerations/resurrection.html|title=Theological Considerations—The Resurrection|publisher=JesusFamilyTomb.com|accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's religious consultant [[James Tabor]] stated that the fact that Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he said could have been spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Islamic views===

Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic view of his disappearance]], as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: ''That they said (in boast), "We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/dispTargam.asp?l=arb&amp;t=eng&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=4&amp;nAya=157 Quran 4:157]&lt;/ref&gt; The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==

Following the March 4, 2007, airing of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' on the Discovery Channel, American journalist [[Ted Koppel]] aired a program entitled ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', whose guests included the director [[Simcha Jacobovici]], [[James Tabor]], Chair of the Department of [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, [[Jonathan Reed]], Professor of Religion at the [[University of LaVerne]] and co-author of ''Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text,'' and [[William G. Dever|William Dever]], an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.

Alan Cooperman, writer of ''The Washington Post'' article also states this: "Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, [[Amos Kloner]], who originally excavated the tomb, and [[Joe Zias]], former curator of archaeology at the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]]. Kloner told the [[Jerusalem Post]] that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," and "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film." he told the BBC News website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm ''Jesus tomb found, says film-maker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the documentary ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'', various professionals had claimed:

# concerning the ossuaries marked Yeshua` ("Jesus") and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because "the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife";
# that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Yeshua` ossuaries and referred to the James ossuary as the "missing link" from the tomb of Yeshua` (Jesus);
# and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Yeshua` had actually been the infamous James ossuary believed to contain the remains of the brother of Yeshua`.

During Ted Koppel's critique, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—a Critical Look'', Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.

# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had NOT concluded that the remains of Yeshua` and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife. In fact, he had logically stated, "you cannot genetically test for marriage."
# Koppel had a written denial from the [[Suffolk Crime Lab]] Director (Robert Genna) asserting that he had NOT stated the James ossuary patina matched that of the Yeshua` ossuary. He denied ever saying they were a match, and said he'd have to do much more comparison testing of other tombs before he could draw any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Yeshua`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it was not the same by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', that Jacobovici's and Cameron's "conclusions were already drawn in the beginning" of the inquiry and that their "argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Questions==

===The Three Skulls===

Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: "This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site quotation about the skulls.''|url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/new_discoveries/the_chevron.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Inside, they found 10 ossuaries and three skulls.''|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/185708 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Stuart | last=Laidlaw | date=2007-02-26 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the documentary==
Early Christianity scholar [[R. Joseph Hoffmann]], chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film "is all about bad assumptions," beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer."&lt;ref&gt;"Who is Entombed in the 'Jesus Tomb'?" ''U.S. News,'' March 12, 2007, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, [[Amos Kloner]], who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:
:"It makes a great story for a TV film, but it's completely impossible. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |last=Bozell |first=Brent |title=What Bones of Jesus? |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302074621/http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |archive-date=2007-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:
:"Simcha has no credibility whatsoever," says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy [[James Cameron|Cameron]], who made ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ Have Researchers Found Jesus Christ's Tomb? - Newsweek Beliefs - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227105907/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned Joe Zias has published in his own site a "viewers' guide" to the Talpiot Tomb documentary, in which he systematically rebuts the film's argumentation and gives much background information about the people involved in it.&lt;ref name=zias&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joezias.com/tomb.html | title=Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb 'documentary' | work=personal website | author = Joe Zias | date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfann also thinks the inscription read as "Jesus" has been misread and suggests that the name "Hanun" might be a more accurate rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/story/3894198p-4503665c.html |last=Matthews |first=Karen |title=Jesus tomb claim derided

''The Washington Post'' reports that [[William G. Dever]] (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:
:"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025143235/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-25 |title='Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt |last=Cooperman |first=Alan |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbury Theological Seminary]]'s [[Ben Witherington III]] points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family:&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;
* "So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus 'son of Joseph'. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that."
* "The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?"
* "One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married."
* "The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary—and that's about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names."
* "We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don't match up with the list of [Jesus's] brothers' names."

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]], self-described on their website as "North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology," has published online their own criticism of the "Jesus tomb" claim: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 AIA News - Has the Tomb of Jesus Been Discovered?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084558/http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===DNA and family evidence===

[[Darrell Bock]], a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] points out some of the inconsistencies, including: "If Jesus' family came from [[Galilee]], why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |title=No Need to Yell, Only a Challenge for Some who Need to Step Up and Could (expanded) |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304220146/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington]] points out an inconsistency related to the [[James Ossuary]]. He points out that the James Ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not [[Talpiot]]. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." In his opinion, this is problematic, because "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;

In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former [[FBI]] agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="laidlaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/185708 |title=Jesus tomb claim sparks furor |last=Laidlaw |first=Stuart |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: "[T]he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all."&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt; This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the "Jesus son of Joseph" and the "Mariamne" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.

''[[The New York Times]]'' article of February 27, 2007, ([http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/ZNYT02/702270730/-1/ZNYT reprinted in full on many websites)] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, said there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude that the bodies in the "Jesus" and "Mary Magdalene" ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. "We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," he said. "We took the story that far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one [http://jesus-crypt-fraud.blogspot.com/ blog], "the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related—hence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film."

[[William G. Dever]] said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. "I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem," Magness writes.

According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

There is no information on analyzing relation of "Mary" and "Jesus son of Joseph" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an [[ossuary]]. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of "Mariamne e Mara" and "Jesus son of Joseph."

===Interpretation of the inscriptions===

David Mavorah, a curator of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely."&lt;ref name=pilkington&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,2022252,00.html |title=Is this really the last resting place of Jesus, Mary Magdalene—and their son? |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |author2=McCarthy, Rory  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the [[The Lost Tomb of Jesus#Statistical report|statistics section above]].

Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526032109/http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 |title=Clergy, scholars assail tomb of Jesus film |publisher=The Courier-Journal |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-27}} &lt;/ref&gt; told the ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time.&lt;ref name=pilkington /&gt; Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. They just want to get money for it."&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[Richard Bauckham]], professor at the [[University of St Andrews]], catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, "Jesus" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and "Mary/Mariamne" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names "Jesus" and "Mary/Mariamne" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are "very small indeed."&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |title=Hollywood Hype: The Oscars and Jesus' Family Tomb, What Do They Share? (expanded version) |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073737/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is ''possible'' to read it as "Yeshua" that "overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Yeshua` bar Yehosef''.'"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The name "Mary" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyhabermas.com/articles/The_Lost_Tomb_of_Jesus/losttombofjesus_response.htm "The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Response to the Discovery-Channel Documentary Directed by James Cameron"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Lawrence Stager|Lawrence E. Stager]], the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at [[Harvard]], said the documentary was "exploiting the whole trend that caught on with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]].'' One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'"&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[William G. Dever]] said, "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers "have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt; He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site.&lt;ref name=zias /&gt;
[[François Bovon]] has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=656 |title=Society of Biblical Literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
As I was interviewed for the Discovery Channel's program The Lost Tomb of Jesus, I would like to express my opinion here.

First, I have now seen the program and am not convinced of its main thesis. When I was questioned by Simcha Jacobovici and his team the questions were directed toward the Acts of Philip and the role of Mariamne in this text. I was not informed of the whole program and the orientation of the script.

Second, having watched the film, in listening to it, I hear two voices, a kind of double discourse. On one hand there is the wish to open a scholarly discussion; on the other there is the wish to push a personal agenda. I must say that the reconstructions of Jesus' marriage with Mary Magdalene and the birth of a child belong for me to science fiction.

Third, to be more credible, the program should deal with the very ancient tradition of the Holy Sepulcher, since the emperor Constantine in the fourth century C.E. built this monument on the spot at which the emperor Hadrian in the second century C.E. erected the forum of Aelia Capitolina and built on it a temple to Aphrodite at the place where Jesus' tomb was venerated.

Fourth, I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.

Fifth, the Mariamne of the Acts of Philip is part of the apostolic team with Philip and Bartholomew; she teaches and baptizes. In the beginning, her faith is stronger than Philip's faith. This portrayal of Mariamne fits very well with the portrayal of Mary of Magdala in the Manichean Psalms, the Gospel of Mary, and Pistis Sophia. My interest is not historical, but on the level of literary traditions. I have suggested this identification in 1984 already in an article of New Testament Studies.

====Symposium and media coverage====

Following a symposium at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html | work=Time | title=Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn | work=CNN | title= Video | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened.

Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Old Straight Track: Its Mounds, Beacons, Moats, Sites and Mark Stones''''' is a book by [[Alfred Watkins]], first published in 1925, describing the existence of alleged [[ley lines]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=Belanger&gt;[http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2003/legends33_12132003.shtml Ley Lines, Old Straight Tracks, and Earth Energies by Jeff Belanger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Watkins presents a methodical and thorough exposition of his theories of ley lines, following an earlier much shorter publication, "Early British Trackways" (1922).  The book has a preface, thirty chapters, four appendices and an index. There are many figures, and photographs taken by the author.

The book is considered the first book written about leys, and the first book to document and map alleged ley lines in Britain, primarily southern England.

The book was disregarded by archaeologists but saw a resurgence of interest with the rise of [[New Age]] ideas in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Merlin|last=Coverley|title=Psychogeography|location=Harpenden|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2010|page=52|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins' ideas also influenced contemporary [[psychogeography]], including [[Iain Sinclair]]'s ''Lud Heat'' (1975), which in turn influenced [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s novel ''[[Hawksmoor (novel)|Hawksmoor]]'' (1985).{{sfn|Coverley|2010|p=53}}

==Criticism==
Watkins' work met with early scepticism from archaeologists, one of whom, [[O. G. S. Crawford]], refused to accept advertisements for ''The Old Straight Track'' in the journal ''Antiquity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoesmith, R. |date=1990|title=Alfred Watkins: a Herefordshire Man|page= 132|location= Woonton Almeley|publisher= Logaston Press|isbn= 0-9510242-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One criticism of Watkins' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that "connect" sites is trivial and ascribable to [[coincidence]]. A statistical analysis of lines concluded: "the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Matthew|title=Archaeological Theory: An Introduction|date=29 Dec 2009|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0015-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYHwXdNVxzMC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22ley+lines%22+density#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ley%20lines%22%20density&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 May 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
The book was reprinted as {{ISBN|0-349-13707-2}} on April 2, 1994 by "Abacus". Editions or reprints were published in 1925, 1933, 1945, 1948, 1970, 1974 and 1994. The Abacus edition of 1970 was reprinted up to 1999 at least, and carries a copyright dated 1970 "Allen Watkins and Marion Watkins".

The '''Thirty Tyrants''' ({{lang-grc|οἱ τριάκοντα τύραννοι}}, ''hoi triákonta týrannoi'') were a [[laconophilia|pro-Spartan]] [[oligarchy]] installed in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] after its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 404 BC. Upon [[Lysander]]'s request, the Thirty were elected as a government, not just as a legislative committee.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, Peter. ''The Thirty at Athens'' p. 50 (hardcover {{ISBN|0801414504}})&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirty Tyrants maintained power for eight months. Though brief, their reign resulted in the killing of 5% of the Athenian population, the confiscation of citizens' property, and the exile of other [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, Andrew. ''Remembering Defeat: Civil War and Civic Memory in Ancient Athens''. (hardcover {{ISBN|0-8018-6790-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; They became known as the "Thirty Tyrants" because of their cruel and oppressive tactics. The two leading members were [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15–16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rule of the Thirty==

With Spartan support, the Thirty established an interim government in Athens. The Thirty were concerned with the revision and/or erasure of democratic laws inscribed on the wall next to the [[Stoa Basileios]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Consequently, the Thirty reduced the rights of Athenian citizens in order to institute an [[oligarchic]]al regime. The Thirty appointed a council of 500 to serve the judicial functions formerly belonging to all the citizens.&lt;ref name=AC35.1&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BCE).]&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all Athenian men had their rights removed. In fact, the Thirty chose 3,000 Athenian men "to share in the government".&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; These hand-selected individuals had the right to carry weapons, to have a jury trial, and to reside within city limits.&lt;ref name=Xen3.4.1&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 3.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; The list of the selected 3,000 was consistently revised.&lt;ref name=Xen3.4.1/&gt; Although little is known about these 3,000 men ‒ for a complete record was never documented ‒ it is hypothesised{{by whom|date=September 2016}} that the Thirty appointed these select few as the only men the Thirty could find who were devotedly loyal to their regime.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Athenian citizens did not support the rule of the Thirty.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Led by [[Critias]], the Thirty Tyrants presided over a reign of terror in which they executed, murdered, and exiled hundreds of Athenians, seizing their possessions afterward. Both [[Isocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] (the latter in the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenian Constitution]]'') have reported that the Thirty executed 1500 people without trial.&lt;ref&gt;Nails, Debra. The People of Plato: A Prosopography of Plato and Other Socratics. Hackett Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0872205649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC35.1/&gt; Critias, a former pupil of [[Socrates]], has been described as "the first [[Robespierre]]"&lt;ref&gt;Stone, I.F. The Trial of Socrates. Anchor Books, reprinted edition 1989. {{ISBN|978-0385260329}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his cruelty and inhumanity; he evidently aimed to end democracy, regardless of the human cost.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, 2002, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirty removed criminals as well as many ordinary citizens whom they considered "unfriendly" to the new regime for expressing support for the democracy. One of their targets was [[Theramenes]], whom  Critias believed to be a threat to the rule of the oligarchy. Critias accused Theramenes of conspiracy and treason, and then forced him to drink [[Poison hemlock|hemlock]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 2.3.56&lt;/ref&gt;  Many wealthy citizens were executed simply so the oligarchs could confiscate their assets, which were then distributed among the Thirty and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon ''Hellenica'' 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; They also hired 300 "lash-bearers" or whip-bearing men to intimidate Athenian citizens.&lt;ref name=AC35.1/&gt;

The Thirty's regime did not meet with much overt opposition, although many Athenians disliked the new form of government. Those who did not approve of the new laws could either fight ‒ and risk exile or execution ‒ or accept the Thirty's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of [[democracy]] chose to fight and were exiled, among them [[Thrasybulus]], a [[trierarch]] in the Athenian navy and noted supporter of democratic government. The [[Phyle Campaign|uprising that overthrew]] the Thirty in 403 BC was orchestrated by a group of exiles led by Thrasybulus. Critias was killed in the initial revolt.&lt;ref&gt;
Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 3.4.19
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The Thirty Tyrants' brief reign was marred by violence and corruption. In fact, historians have argued that the violence and brutality the Thirty carried out in Athens was necessary to transition Athens from a democracy to an oligarchy.&lt;ref name=AncientTyranny&gt;Lewis, Sian. ''Ancient Tyranny'', p. 213. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Print. (Hardcover, {{ISBN|0748621253}})&lt;/ref&gt; However, the violence produced an unanticipated paradox. The more violent the Thirty's regime became, the more opposition they faced.&lt;ref name=AncientTyranny/&gt; The increased level of opposition ultimately resulted in the upheaval of the Thirty's regime by Thrasybulus' rebel forces. After the revolution, Athens needed to decide the best way to govern the liberated city-state and to reconcile the atrocities committed by the Thirty. It was decided to give amnesty to all of the members of the selected 3,000, except for the Thirty themselves, the Eleven{{clarify|reason=Eleven? Ten? who? or what?|date=November 2017}}, and the ten who ruled in [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 2.4.38&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution that overthrew the Thirty Tyrants, Athens and her citizens struggled to reconcile and rebuild.

== Mention of the Thirty ==

[[Plato]], in the opening portion of his ''[[Seventh Letter]]'', recounts the rule of the Thirty Tyrants during his youth. He explains that following the revolution, fifty-one men became rulers of a new government, with a specific group of thirty in charge of the public affairs of Athens. Ten of the fifty-one were to rule the city, and eleven were sent to rule [[Piraeus]]. Plato corroborates the general consensus found in other sources: the rule of the Thirty was "reviled as it was by many". The rule of the Thirty made the former democracy resemble a golden age in comparison. Plato also includes an account of the interaction between [[Socrates]] and the Thirty.&lt;ref name=SeventhLetter&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/seventh_letter.html ''Seventh Letter of Plato'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato mentions [[Lysias]], one of the men from Athens who escaped the Thirty's reign of terror. Lysias' brother [[Polemarchus]] "fell victim to the Thirty Tyrants".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socrates and the Thirty==
Due to their desire to remain in complete control over Athens, the Thirty sought to exile or kill anyone who outwardly opposed their regime. Socrates remained in the city through this period, which caused the public to associate him with the Thirty and may have contributed to his eventual death sentence, especially since Critias had been his student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/if-stone-breaks-the-socrates-story-an-old-muckraker-sheds-fresh.html|title=I.F. Stone Breaks the Socrates Story|last=Stone|first=I.F.|date=April 8, 1979|work=The New York Times Magazine|access-date=June 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates recounts an incident in which the Thirty once ordered him (and four other men) to bring before them [[Leon of Salamis]], a man known for his justice and upright character, for execution. While the other four men obeyed, Socrates refused, not wanting to partake in the guilt of the executioners. However, he did not attempt to warn or save Leon of Salamis. By disobeying, Socrates may have been placing his own life in jeopardy, and he claimed it was only the disbanding of the oligarchy soon afterward that saved his life:

"When the oligarchy came into power, the Thirty Commissioners in their turn summoned me and four others to the Round Chamber and instructed us to go and fetch Leon of Salamis from his home for execution. This was of course only one of many instances in which they issued such instructions, their object being to implicate as many people as possible in their crimes. On this occasion, however, I again made it clear, not by my words but by my actions, that the attention I paid to death was zero (if that is not too unrefined a claim); but that I gave all my attention to avoiding doing anything unjust or unholy. Powerful as it was, that government did not terrify me into doing a wrong action. When we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to Salamis and arrested Leon, but I simply went home."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 32c-d&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in his ''Seventh Letter'', Plato describes the interaction between the Thirty and Socrates from his own point of view: "They tried to send a friend of mine, the aged Socrates, whom I should scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day, with some other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution, in order that, whether he wished it, or not, he might share the guilt of their conduct; but he would not obey them, risking all consequences in preference to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deeds."&lt;ref name=SeventhLetter/&gt;

The Italian historian Luciano Canfora has inferred that another of Socrates' students, Xenophon, may have played an important part in the rule of the Thirty, as one of the two commanders of the cavalry, which were the Thirty's militia. Indeed, in his book ''Hipparchos'' (Commander of the cavalry), Xenophon only mentions one of the commanders (there were always two), only to revile him, but never mentions the other.&lt;ref&gt; Luciano Canfora ''Storie di Oligarchi''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xenophon's ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' (Bk 1, Ch 2), Xenophon also reports a contentious confrontation between Socrates and the Thirty, Critias included. Socrates is summoned before the group and ordered not to instruct or speak to anyone, whereupon Socrates mocks the order by asking whether he will be allowed to ask to buy food in the marketplace. Xenophon uses the episode to illustrate both Socrates' own critique of the slaughtering of Athenian citizens by the Thirty, as well as make the case that the relationship between Critias and Socrates had significantly deteriorated by the time Critias obtained power.

'''Triadization''' (or '''triadisation''') is a proposed alternative to the theory of [[globalization]]. It states that political, economic and [[Social integration|socio-cultural integration]] have been limited to three regions of the world: [[Japan]] and the [[newly industrialized countries]] of [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt; Milward, Bob. Globalisation?: Internationalisation and Monopoly Capitalism : Historical Processes and Capitalist Dynamism. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outside of these regions, according to the theory, the effects of so-called "globalization" have not been felt, and hence it cannot be truly called "global". Instead, the [[economic interdependence]] between the countries of the "triad" supposedly leads to the alienation of the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dadalos.org/globalisation/grundkurs_2/triadisierung.htm |title=D@dalos - Globalisation: Triadisation |publisher=Dadalos.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011821/http://www.dadalos.org/globalisation/grundkurs_2/triadisierung.htm |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This alienation is described by the theory as the result of the fact that "fragmentation of the world into regional blocks is taking place, featured in the tendency to strengthen economic interdependence and transactions within them but not among them". &lt;ref&gt;Tadic, Tadija. "The Globalization Debate: The Sceptics." PANOECONOMICUS (2006): 179-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This further entrenches the position of the triad, and prevents the growth of the rest of the world.

'''Yuga''' in [[Hinduism]] is an [[unit of time|epoch or era]] within a four-age cycle. A complete Yuga starts with the ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', via ''[[Treta Yuga]]'' and ''[[Dvapara Yuga]]'' into a ''[[Kali Yuga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&amp;q=four%20yugas&amp;f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our present time is a ''Kali Yuga'', which started at 3102 BCE with the end of the [[Kurukshetra War]] (or Mahabharata war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WgnfbxkFsFoC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=kali+yuga+started+with+Mahabharata#v=onepage&amp;q=kali%20yuga%20started%20with%20Mahabharata&amp;f=false|title=Age of Bhārata War|page=223|first=Giriwar Charan|last=Agarwala|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four yugas==
There are four Yugas in one cycle:
* ''[[Satya Yuga]]''
* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''
* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''
* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''

=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===
*Satya Yuga (also known as Krita Yuga "Golden Age"): The first and best Yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This Yuga has Zero Percent of Crime and Hundred Percent of Kindness. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were gigantic, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*Treta Yuga: Is considered to be the second Yuga in order, however Treta means the "Third". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. Oceans and deserts are formed.  People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*Dvapara Yuga: Is considered to be the third Yuga in order.  Dvapara means "two pair" or "after two". In this age, people become tainted with [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamasic]] qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.
*Kali Yuga: The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People become sinners and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished.  Families become non-existent. By the end of Kali Yuga the average lifespan of humans will be as low as 70 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Durations of the four Yugas==
[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|frame|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]

According to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:&lt;ref name=penprase182/&gt;
* Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&amp;f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 Human years&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Together, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga and equal 4.32 million human years.&lt;ref name=penprase182&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4.32 billion human years. A Mahakalpa consists of 100 years of Brahma.&lt;ref name=penprase182/&gt;

According to [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19, which most scholars agree was composed around 500 to 1000 CE, the Yugas are much longer, using a divine year in which one day is equal to one human year, thus:
{{quote|one year of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|demigod]]s is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 x 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 x 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 x 360, or 864,000 years.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://vedabase.com/sb/3/11/19/|title=SB 3.11.19|first=|last=|access-date=15 July 2011|website=vedabase.com|date=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Viṣṇu Purāṇa Time measurement section of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa Book I Chapter III adds:

* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.
* 12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mahā-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva (divine) Yuga).
* 2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.

While the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.

==Decline==
The ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.
* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' –  Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits. Average human lifespan was 100,000 years.
* ''[[Treta Yuga]]'' – There was 3 quarter virtue and 1 quarter sin. Normal human stature was 14 cubits. Average human lifespan was 10,000 years.
* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]'' – There was 1 half virtue &amp; 1 half sin. Normal human stature was 7 cubits. Average human lifespan was 1,000 years.
* ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' – There is 1 quarter virtue &amp; 3 quarter sin. Normal human stature is 3.5 cubits. Average human lifespan will be 100 years.
