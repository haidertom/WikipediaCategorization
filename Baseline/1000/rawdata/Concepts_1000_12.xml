'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}
{{Christian mysticism}}

==Christianity==
===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

[[Thomas Aquinas]] was born ten years later (1225-1274) and, although in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |author-link=Kallistos Ware |year=1963 |publication-date= |title=The Orthodox Church |page=73 |place=London |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=0-14-020592-6 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his reading in a [[Aristotelianism|neo-Aristotelian]] key{{sfn|Przywara|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Fc9RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Aquinas+stands+out+as+Aristotle's+most+important+medieval+commentator+—+both+for+having+clarified+received+notions+of+analogy+and+for+assessing+its+theological+uses%22 38 ("Thomas Aquinas stands out as Aristotle's most important medieval commentator — both for having clarified received notions of analogy and for assessing its theological uses")]}} of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the "analogical way" as ''[[wikt:tertium|tertium]]'' between ''via negativa'' and ''via positiva'': the ''via eminentiae'' (see also ''[[analogia entis]]''). According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

=== History ===
{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}
The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''Sa''.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''Sa'' ≠ ''Sb''.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers ("''[[Mathematical induction#Axiom of induction|Induction axiom]]''").

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

{{cosmology}}
In modern [[physical cosmology]], the '''cosmological principle''' is the notion that the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[Isotropy|isotropic]] when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large-scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the [[Big Bang]].

==Definition==
Astronomer William Keel explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.&lt;ref name=Keel&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Galaxy Formation (2nd ed.) |author=William C. Keel |isbn=978-3-540-72534-3 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cosmological principle depends on a definition of "observer," and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences.

"Observers" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, "the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are."&lt;ref name=Liddle&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.) |author=Andrew Liddle |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7 |year=2003 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a "foamy" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.

The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]]. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout" {{dubious|Homogeneity vs isotropy|date=September 2016}}). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.

== Origin ==
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) of Isaac Newton.{{dubious|it is debatable that Newton stated the cosmological principle in the form we intend at this day and age.|date=May 2018}} In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of "[[universal gravitation]]" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.

== Implications ==
Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium.&lt;ref name="CMB_Timeline300"&gt;[[:Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg]] - NASA (public domain image)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by [[nucleosynthesis]] in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae explosions and new star formation from the supernovae remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well.

A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in [[mechanical equilibrium]]. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see [[timeline of the formation of the Universe|timeline of the universe]]).

Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, [[Alexander Friedmann]] set out a variant of [[Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Welt als Raum und Zeit (The World as Space and Time) |publisher=Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften |author=[[Alexander Friedmann]] |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/248202523&amp;referer=brief_results  |isbn=3-8171-3287-5  |year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abramovitch&gt;{{cite book |page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DPC4a0CSq4C&amp;pg=PA219 |isbn=0-521-38470-2 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |title=Alexander A. Friedmann: The Man who Made the Universe Expand |author1=Ėduard Abramovich Tropp |author2=Viktor Ya. Frenkel |author3=Artur Davidovich Chernin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Georges Lemaître]] derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations.&lt;ref name=Lemaitre1927&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Un univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | year=1927 | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | issue=5 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L | pages=49–56 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }} ''translated by [[A. S. Eddington]]'': {{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Expansion of the universe, A homogeneous universe of constant mass and increasing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extra-galactic nebulæ | year=1931 | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=91 | bibcode=1931MNRAS..91..483L | pages=483–490 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | doi=10.1093/mnras/91.5.483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to [[general relativity]].

== Criticism ==
[[Karl Popper]] criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes "our ''lack'' of knowledge a principle of ''knowing something''". He summarized his position as:
:the “cosmological principles” were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh: [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9062/1/Popper_%26_cosmology_PhilSci.pdf “The most philosophically of all the sciences”: Karl Popper and physical cosmology] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations ==
Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, it ''is'' statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. The [[cosmic microwave background]] is isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/universe-homogeneous-300-million-light-years/24149/]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent findings have called this view into question. Data from the [[Planck Mission]] shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). Therefore, the [[European Space Agency]] (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.&lt;ref name="Planck"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sci.esa.int/planck/51551-simple-but-challenging-the-universe-according-to-planck/ | title=Simple but challenging: the Universe according to Planck | work=[[ESA Science &amp; Technology]] | origyear=March 21, 2013 |date= October 5, 2016 | accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconsistencies===
The ''cosmological principle'' implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is [[homogeneous]]. This means that different places will appear similar to one another, so sufficiently large structures cannot exist{{clarify|what is actually meant by existence of a structure here?|date=April 2017}}. Yadav and his colleagues have suggested a maximum scale of 260[[Parsec#Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs|/h Mpc]] for structures within the universe according to this{{which|date=April 2017}} [[heuristic]]. Other authors have suggested values as low as 60/h Mpc.&lt;ref name=Yadav&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Jaswant |author2=J. S. Bagla |author3=Nishikanta Khandai|title=Fractal dimension as a measure of the scale of homogeneity|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=25 February 2010|volume=405|issue=3|pages=2009–2015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16612.x |arxiv = 1001.0617 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2009Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadav's calculation suggests that the maximum size of a structure can be about 370&amp;nbsp;Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clowers |first=Roger G. |year=2013 |title=A structure in the early universe at z ~ 1.3 that exceeds the homogeneity scale of the R-W concordance cosmology |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=429 |issue=4 |pages=2910–2916|arxiv=1211.6256 |bibcode=2013MNRAS.429.2910C |doi= 10.1093/mnras/sts497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of observations conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes:

*The [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale.
*The [[Sloan Great Wall]], discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc,&lt;ref name=apj624_2_463&gt;{{Cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Gott | first1=J.

These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to the Lorentz group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994.

Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.

''Studies in Soviet Thought'', Vol.39 No. 3, 1990, pp.333-341.[http://staff.ulsu.ru/bazhanov/russian/fatevas1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]] notes that [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]] provided axiomatizations of many-valued logics in:  Jaśkowski, "On the rules of supposition in formal logic". ''Studia Logica'' No. 1, 1934.[http://www.logik.ch/daten/jaskowski.pdf] See Susan Haack, ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Priyanka Kaushal, Neeraj Mohan and Parvinder S. Sandhu, "Relevancy of Fuzzy Concept in Mathematics". ''International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology'', Vol. 1, No. 3, August 2010.[http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8. New York: Macmillan, first edition 1967, pp. 218–221; William P. Alston, ''A Realist Conception of Truth''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German mathematician Dieter Klaua [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Klaua] published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klaua. "Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre". ''Monatsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften'' (Berlin), Vol. 7, pp. 859–867, 1965. Siegfried Gottwald, "An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems''. Vol. 161 Issue 18, September 2010, pp. 2369–2379.&lt;/ref&gt; but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets").&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Gottwald, "Shaping the logic of fuzzy set theory". In: Cintula, Petr et al. (eds.), ''Witnessed years. Essays in honour of Petr Hájek''. London: College Publications, 2009, pp. 193–208. [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and [[Nicholas Rescher]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Ackermann, ''An introduction to many-valued logics''. London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967; Nicholas Rescher, ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher’s book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974.&lt;ref&gt; Robert G. Wolf, “A survey of many-valued logic (1966–1974)”, in: J. Michael Dunn and George Epstein (eds.), ''Modern Uses of Multiple-Valued Logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1977, 167–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Haack provides references to significant works after 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Merrie  Bergmann, ''An  Introduction  to  Many-Valued  and  Fuzzy  Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Zadeh who played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017. Lotfi A Zadeh with George J. Klir and Bo Yua, ''Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems: Selected Papers''. Singapore and River Edge (N.J.): World Scientific Publishing Company, 1996. This last title includes a bibliography of Zadeh's writings up to 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness, Zadeh's engineering approach had the advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "Cybernetics, system(s) theory, information theory and Fuzzy Sets and Systems in the 1950s and 1960s". ''Information Sciences'' No. 180, 2010, pp. 4459-4476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013 [http://isdlab.ie.ntnu.edu.tw/ntust/ifsa/files/newsletter/Vol10/IFSAnewsletterV10N1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Noorden, Brendan Maher &amp; Regina Nuzzo, "The top 100 papers". ''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1", ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 8, pp. 199–249, 1975. Jerry M. Mendel and Robert I. Bob John, "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Made Simple." ''IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems'', Vol. 10, No. 2, April 2002, pp. 117-127. Jerry M. Mendel, "Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems". In: ''Information Sciences'' 177, 2007, pp. 84–110.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.477&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, in the former case, each fuzzy number is linked to a non-fuzzy (natural) number, while in the latter case, each fuzzy number is linked to another fuzzy number.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

Humberto Bustince et al. (eds.), ''Fuzzy Sets and Their Extensions: Representation, Aggregation and Models. Intelligent Systems from Decision Making to Data Mining, Web Intelligence and Computer Vision.''  Berlin: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nowadays widely used in:

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under [[artificial intelligence]] or [[soft computing]].

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic". Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, at Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of Berkeley, California, circa 2014.[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/stimfl.html] For more details about the global fuzzy logic community, see [http://users.abo.fi/rfuller/fuzs.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Google Scholar]] found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96." ''New York Times'', 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''. Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic programming techniques for this kind of fuzzy [[concept mapping]] and [[deep learning]] are by now well-established&lt;ref&gt;E.g.

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C".

One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm."

''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump".

====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference, IPMU 2010, Dortmund, Germany, June 28–July 2, 2010 (Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 81), Part II. Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality. 
*The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] concluded that formalization "runs the risk of leaving behind the subjectmatter we are interested in" and "also runs the risk of increasing rather than decreasing the muddle."&lt;ref&gt;J.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and linguistics===
In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts." ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Vol. 2, 1973, pp. 458–508.[http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ragin]] and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Ragin]], ''Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Shaomin Li, "Measuring the fuzziness of human thoughts: An application of fuzzy sets to sociological research". ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', Volume 14, Issue 1, 1989, pp. 67–84; Mario Quaranta, "Fuzzy set theory and concepts: a proposal for concept formation and operationalization". ''Comparative Sociology'' Vol. 12, issue 6, 2013, pp. 785-820.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoiber, Frederik Caselitz, Marie Sophie Heinelt, “How to deal with socio-ethnic conflicts in Latin America? Analysing conditions on multiple levels with fsQCA.” Paper for the conference “QCA. Applications and Methodological Challenges”, November 22–23, 2013, Goethe University Frankfurt.[https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/conpar/download/stoibercaselitzheinelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], the [[European Union]] and [[Croatia]], economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Draeseke &amp; David E.A. Giles, "A fuzzy logic approach to modelling the New Zealand underground economy." ''Mathematics and Computers in Simulation'', Vol. 59, No. 1, 2002, pp. 115–123.

Mohammad Hossien Pourkazemi, Mohammad Naser Sherafat and Zahra Delfan Azari , "Modeling Iran`s Underground Economy: A Fuzzy Logic Approach". In: ''Iranian Economic Review'', Volume 19, Issue 1, Winter 2015, Page 91-106; Kristina Marsic &amp; Dijana Oreski, "Estimation and Comparison of Underground Economy in Croatia and European Union Countries: Fuzzy Logic Approach". In: ''Journal of Information and organizational Sciences'', Vol. 49, No. 1, 2016, pp.83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness, democracy, control and collective decision choice system: a theory on political economy of rent-seeking and profit-harvesting''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Gossen's laws''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810 – 1858), are three laws of economics:
* '''Gossen's First Law''' is the [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|"law" of diminishing marginal utility]]: that [[marginal utility|marginal utilities]] are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making.
* '''[[Gossen's second law|Gossen's Second Law]]''', which presumes that [[utility]] is at least weakly quantified, is that in equilibrium an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}\,\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is utility
:* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
:* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* '''Gossen's Third Law''' is that [[scarcity]] is a precondition for economic value.

The citation referenced is the translation by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in which the traslator names only two laws: 1) ”If an enjoyment is experienced uninterruptedly, the corresponding intensity of pleasure decreases continuously until satiety is ultimately reached, at which point the intensity becomes nil." and, 2) "A similar decrease of the intensity of pleasure takes place if a previous enjoyment of the same kind of pleasure is repeated. Not only does the initial intensity of pleasure become smaller but also the duration of the enjoyment becomes shorter, so that satiety is reached sooner. Moreover, the sooner the repetition, the smaller becomes the initial intensity as well as the duration of the enjoyment." (p.lxxx)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16265">There are a number of meanings for the term [[humanitarian]].  Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating [[suffering]].  It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict.  '''Humanitarian principles''' govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.

==Core humanitarian principles==

===Humanity===
The principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody3  Pictet (1979) Humanity]. [[Jean Pictet|Pictet's]] commentary is focused on the Red Cross use of the principle of humanity, but includes more general comments relevant to the whole humanitarian sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Imperative===
The [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance.  It states the obligation of the international community "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed."&lt;ref&gt;For a critical view see: Hugo Slim, "Relief agencies and moral standing in war: principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and solidarity, Development in Practice, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4/August 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality===
Provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] must be [[impartiality|impartial]] and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.  It must be based on need alone.

For most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO.  However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;(See:  [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping]] (Brahimi report)pp. ix &amp; 9){{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114055129/http://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Humanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.

Problems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors.  Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities.  The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments  through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.&lt;ref&gt;(see: [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1996_3/18-19.html Joanna Macrae: NGOs: Has the 'N' gone missing?] [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1998_2/2-7.html Randolph Kent: Footing the aid bill])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining principles===
The core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.

==Additional humanitarian principles==
In addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.

===Neutrality===
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality.  For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

The principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to "engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature."  The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.

[[neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]] can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state.  "Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing.  GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature.  According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of the concept of neutrality with respect to humanitarian response see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z Denise Plattner])&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone.  Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.

===Proselytism===
The provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds.  All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.

==Principles based on field experience in emergencies==
All of the above principles are important requirements for  effective field operations.  They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response.  In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.

If a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger.  If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.

==Sources==
The core principles, found in the [[Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct]] and in GA Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality—in the case of the UN), and IV (independence).&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of their background and a commentary on the principles see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5mje9n Jean Pictet 1979])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian accountability ==
Accountability has been defined as: "the processes through which an organisation makes a 
commitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, Robert M. |author2=Monica Blagescu |author3=Lucy de las Casas |title=Pathways to Accountability: The Gap Framework |publisher=One World Trust |location= |year=2005 |pages= 5|isbn=0-9504434-6-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=dtrust.org/documents/Pathways_to_Accountability,_A_Short_Guide_to_the_GAP_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] adds: "Accountability is about using power responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/other/faq.aspx#top|title=HAPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] states:
"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries.  However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly "upward accountability", i.e. to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anderson: {{cite web |url=http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180533/http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries.  Examples include the [[Sphere Project]], [[ALNAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/|title=ALNAP - Home|website=www.alnap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103064539/http://www.compasqualite.org/en/index/index.php|title=Quality COMPAS - Homepage|date=3 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[People In Aid]] Code of Good Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleinaid.org/code/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], which runs a "global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies."

==Additional principles==
The RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience  with development assistance.
*Agencies should operate with respect to culture and custom
*Humanitarian response should use local resources and capacities as much as possible
*The participation of the beneficiaries should be encouraged
*Emergency response should strive to reduce future vulnerabilities
*Agencies should be accountable to both donors and beneficiaries
*Humanitarian agencies should use information activities to portray victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects

==The right to life with dignity==
The Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Sphere Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the language of human rights to remind that the [[right to life]] which is proclaimed in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] is related to [[human dignity]].

==Vulnerability and behavioral issues==
Humanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations.  However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] of those affected by war and violence.  Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.

===Sexual exploitation and abuse===
One of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation and abuse]] of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers.  In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

A number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses.  In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment.  The plan explicitly prohibited the "Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour."  The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;(See:[http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex IASC, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120184234/http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex |date=2006-11-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Substantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The [[People In Aid#The People In Aid Code of Good Practice|People In Aid Code of Good Practice]], an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.

Structures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1256">The '''inherent bad faith model''' of [[information processing]] is a theory in [[political psychology]] that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;The “Inherent Bad Faith Model” Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;  A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored.  They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness.  An example is [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="IBFMR"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

Abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution. Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The '''marginal abatement cost''' ('''MAC'''), in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution.

Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option, MACs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced.

Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a '''marginal abatement cost curve''' (MACC) or '''MAC curve''', which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.

== Usage ==
Carbon traders use MAC curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ MAC curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used MAC curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/globalchange/www/MITJPSPGC_Rpt40.pdf |title=Ellerman, A.D. and Decaux, A., Analysis of post-Kyoto {{CO2}}&amp;#125; emissions trading using marginal abatement curves, 1998. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-makers use MAC curves as [[merit order]] curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions.

However, MAC curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or [[merit order]] curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogt-Schilb, A. and Hallegatte, S., 2014. Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures. |journal=Energy Policy |volume=66|pages= 645–653 |date= |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The way that MAC curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter-temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Marginal abatement cost curves: a call for caution|date=|doi=10.1080/14693062.2011.582347 | volume=12|journal=Climate Policy|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levihn|first=Fabian|date=2016-11-01|title=On the problem of optimizing through least cost per unit, when costs are negative: Implications for cost curves and the definition of economic efficiency|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216312026|journal=Energy|volume=114|pages=1155–1163|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Simon|date=2012-09-01|title=The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512004843|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section: Frontiers of Sustainability|volume=48|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.

In economics, '''marginal cost''' is the change in the [[opportunity cost]] that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the [[cost]] of producing one more unit of a good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = O'Sullivan| first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin| title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| page = 111| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, marginal cost at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered [[fixed cost|fixed]]. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the [[fixed cost]]s of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.

If the [[cost curve|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], the marginal cost &lt;math&gt;MC&lt;/math&gt; is the first derivative of the cost function with respect to the quantity &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Carl|last2=Blume|first2=Lawrence|title=Mathematics for Economists|date=1994|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0393957330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC(Q) = \frac{\ dC}{\ dQ}&lt;/math&gt;
The marginal cost can be a function of quantity if the cost function is non-linear.  If the cost function is not differentiable, the marginal cost can be expressed as follows.
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denotes an incremental change of one unit.

==Cost functions and relationship to average cost==
In the simplest case, the total cost function and its [[derivative]] are expressed as follows, where Q represents the production quantity, VC represents variable costs, FC represents [[fixed cost]]s and TC represents total costs.

Since (by definition) fixed costs do not vary with production quantity, it drops out of the equation when it is differentiated.  The important conclusion is that marginal cost ''is not related to'' fixed costs. This can be compared with [[average total cost]] or ATC, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced and ''does'' include fixed costs.

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=\frac{C_0 + \Delta C}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

For discrete calculation without calculus, marginal cost equals the change in total (or variable) cost that comes with each additional unit produced. In contrast, '''incremental cost''' is the composition of total cost from the surrogate of contributions, where any increment is determined by the contribution of the cost factors, not necessarily by single units.

For instance, suppose the total cost of making 1 shoe is $30 and the total cost of making 2 shoes is $40. The marginal cost of producing the second shoe is $40 – $30 = $10.

Marginal cost is not the cost of producing the "next" or "last" unit.&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg &amp; Suen, The Structure of Economics, A Mathematical Analysis 3rd ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 181.&lt;/ref&gt; As Silberberg and Suen note, the cost of the last unit is the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit. In the short run, increasing production requires using more of the variable input &amp;mdash; conventionally assumed to be labor. Adding more labor to a fixed capital stock reduces the marginal product of labor because of the [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]]. This reduction in productivity is not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit – the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced. Thus the costs of producing the marginal unit of output has two components:
the cost associated with producing the marginal unit
and the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the "damage" to the entire productive process (∂AC/∂q)q. 
The first component is the per unit or average cost. The second unit is the small increase in costs due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units of sold.

Marginal costs can also be expressed as the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labor.&lt;ref&gt;See http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2007/lecture-notes/14_01_lec13.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta VC = {w \Delta L}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w \Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of labor that affects a one unit change in output, this implies that this equals &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt;.

where MPL is the ratio of increase in the quantity produced per unit increase in labour i.e. ΔQ/ΔL.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; MC = \frac{w}{MPL}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chia-Hui Chen, course materials for 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics, Fall 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [12 Sept 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wage rate is assumed constant, marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship&amp;mdash;if marginal cost is increasing  (decreasing) the marginal product of labor is decreasing (increasing).&lt;ref&gt;Note also that AVC = VC/Q=wL/Q = w/(Q/L) OR w/AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economies of scale==
Economies of scale applies to the long run, a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs.  Production may be subject to [[economies of scale]] (or [[diseconomies of scale]]). Economies of scale are said to exist if an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units&amp;mdash; that is, if long-run marginal cost is below long-run average cost, so the latter is falling.  Conversely, there may be levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost, and the average cost is an increasing function of output.  For this generic case, minimum average cost occurs at the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal (when plotted, the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below); this point will ''not'' be at the minimum for marginal cost if fixed costs are greater than 0.

==Perfectly competitive supply curve==

The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]]. (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shutdown point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly "has" an MC curve it does not have a supply curve.  In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price – for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve.

==Decisions taken based on marginal costs==
In perfectly competitive markets, firms decide the quantity to be produced based on marginal costs and sale price. If the sale price is higher than the marginal cost, then they supply the unit and sell it. If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price. In other words, firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is greater than the market price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/glossary/refusaltosell.htm "Piana V. (2011), Refusal to sell - a key concept in Economics and Management, Economics Web Institute."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to fixed costs==

Marginal costs are not affected by changes in fixed cost. Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently, the profit-maximizing quantity and price would not change.  This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short-run variable cost curve. The shapes of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance of the origin of the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.

==Private versus social marginal cost==
{{main|Social cost}}
Of great importance in the theory of marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal ''private'' and ''social'' costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their [[profit maximization]] goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but ''also'' any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive [[externalities]], of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.

Externalities are costs (or benefits) that are not borne by the parties to the economic [[Financial transaction|transaction]]. A producer may, for example, [[pollution|pollute]] the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level.

===Negative externalities of production===
[[Image:NegativeExt.svg|thumb|right|Negative Externalities of Production]]

Much of the time, private and social costs do not diverge from one another, but at times social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When marginal social costs of production are greater than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[negative externality]] of production. Productive processes that result in [[pollution]] are a textbook example of production that creates negative externalities.

Such externalities are a result of firms externalizing their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalizing such costs, we see that members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, we see that an increased cost of production in society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.

In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed.

===Positive externalities of production===
[[Image:PositiveExt.svg|thumb|right|Positive Externalities of Production]]

When marginal social costs of production are less than that of the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a [[positive externality]] of production. Production of [[public good]]s are a textbook example of production that create positive externalities. An example of such a public good, which creates a divergence in social and private costs, includes the production of [[education]]. It is often seen that education is a positive for any whole society, as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market.

Examining the relevant diagram we see that such production creates a social cost curve that is less than that of the private curve. In an equilibrium state, we see that markets creating positive externalities of production will underproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed.

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G.

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

Occam's razor, sometimes referred to as "ontological parsimony", is roughly stated as: Given a choice between two theories, the simplest is the best.

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H. Heinemann 1944).&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Laurence R |year=2001 |title=A NATURAL HISTORY OF NEGATION |url=http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-natural-history-of-negation-Laurence-R.-Horn.pdf |location=Stanford University |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1 |publisher=CLSI Publications |isbn=1-57586-336-7  |accessdate=29 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="text-align:center" | Notation
! Plain Text
! Vocalization
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;
| ¬p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\mathord{\sim} p&lt;/math&gt;
| ~p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;-p&lt;/math&gt;
| -p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | N''p''
|
| En ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;
| p'
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' prime,
 | ''p'' complement
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\overline{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| ̅p
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' bar,
 | Bar ''p''
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;!p&lt;/math&gt;
| !p
| {{unbulleted list
 | Bang ''p''
 | Not ''p''
 }}
|-
|}

The notation N''p'' is [[Polish_notation#Polish_notation_for_logic|Łukasiewicz notation]].

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

[[Image:Ideal feedback model.svg|thumb | right | A simple negative feedback system descriptive, for example, of some electronic amplifiers. The feedback is negative if the [[loop gain]] AB is negative.]]

'''Negative feedback''' (or balancing feedback) occurs when some [[function (Mathematics)|function]] of the output of a system, process, or mechanism is [[feedback|fed back]] in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output, whether caused by changes in the input or by other disturbances.

Whereas [[positive feedback]] tends to lead to instability via [[exponential growth]], [[oscillation]] or [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]], negative feedback generally promotes stability. Negative feedback tends to promote a settling to [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], and reduces the effects of perturbations. Negative [[feedback loop]]s in which just the right amount of correction is applied with optimum timing can be very stable, accurate, and responsive.

Negative feedback is widely used in mechanical and electronic engineering, and also within living organisms,&lt;ref name=Ashby&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen in many other fields from chemistry and economics to physical systems such as the climate. General negative feedback systems are studied in [[Control engineering|control systems engineering]].

== Examples ==
* [[Thermostat#History|Mercury thermostats]] (circa 1600) using expansion and contraction of columns of mercury in response to temperature changes were used in negative feedback systems to control vents in furnaces, maintaining a steady internal temperature.
* In the [[Invisible hand|invisible hand of the market]] metaphor of economic theory (1776), reactions to price movements provide a feedback mechanism to match [[supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]].
* In [[centrifugal governor]]s (1788), negative feedback is used to maintain a near-constant speed of an engine, irrespective of the load or fuel-supply conditions.
* In a [[steering engine]] (1866), power assistance is applied to the rudder with a feedback loop, to maintain the direction set by the steersman.
* In [[servomechanisms]], the [[speed]] or position of an output, as determined by a [[sensor]], is compared to a set value, and any error is reduced by negative feedback to the input.
* In [[Sound|audio]] [[amplifiers]], negative feedback reduces [[distortion]], minimises the effect of manufacturing variations in component parameters, and compensates for changes in characteristics due to temperature change.
* In [[analog computing]] feedback around [[operational amplifiers]] is used to generate [[mathematical functions]] such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[Integral|integration]], [[Derivative|differentiation]], [[logarithm]], and [[antilog]] functions.
* In a [[phase locked loop]] (1932) feedback is used to maintain a generated alternating waveform in a constant phase to a reference signal. In many implementations the generated waveform is the output, but when used as a [[demodulator]] in an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio receiver, the error feedback voltage serves as the demodulated output signal. If there is a [[frequency divider]] between the generated waveform and the phase comparator, the device acts as a [[frequency multiplier]].
* In [[organisms]], feedback enables various measures (e.g. body temperature, or [[blood sugar]] level) to be maintained within a desired range by [[homeostatic]] processes.

== History ==
Negative feedback as a control technique may be seen in the refinements of the [[water clock]] introduced by [[Ctesibius|Ktesibios]] of Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and were used to maintain a constant level in the reservoirs of water clocks as early as 200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breedveld | first1 = Peter C | year = 2004 | title = Port-based modeling of mechatronic systems | url = | journal = Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 99–128 | doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2003.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centrifugal governor.png|thumb|The [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]] is an early example of negative feedback.]]
Negative feedback was implemented in the 17th Century. [[Cornelius Drebbel]] had built [[Thermostat#History|thermostatically-controlled]] incubators and ovens in the early 1600s,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=2013-05-03}}

and [[centrifugal governor]]s were used to regulate the distance and pressure between [[millstone]]s in [[windmill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|last=Hills|first=Richard L|title=Power From the Wind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Watt]] patented a form of governor in 1788 to control the speed of his [[steam engine]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 described "component motions" associated with these governors that lead to a decrease in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation.&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;

The term "[[feedback]]" was well established by the 1920s, in reference to a means of [[Regenerative circuit|boosting the gain]] of an electronic amplifier.&lt;ref name=mindell&gt;

Nyquist and Bode built on Black’s work to develop a theory of amplifier stability.&lt;ref name=BennettS/&gt;

Early researchers in the area of [[cybernetics]] subsequently generalized the idea of negative feedback to cover any goal-seeking or purposeful behavior.&lt;ref name=Rosenblueth&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=All purposeful behavior may be considered to require negative feed-back. If a goal is to be attained, some signals from the goal are necessary at some time to direct the behavior.}}
Cybernetics pioneer [[Norbert Wiener]] helped to formalize the concepts of feedback control, defining feedback in general as "the chain of the transmission and return of information",&lt;ref name=wiener&gt;
Norbert Wiener ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Technology Press; New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback as the case when:
{{quote|text=The information fed back to the control center tends to oppose the departure of the controlled from the controlling quantity...{{rp|page=97}}}}
While the view of feedback as any "circularity of action" helped to keep the theory simple and consistent, [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] pointed out that, while it may clash with definitions that require a "materially evident" connection, "the exact definition of feedback is nowhere important".&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt; Ashby pointed out the limitations of the concept of "feedback":
{{quote|text=The concept of 'feedback', so simple and natural in certain elementary cases, becomes artificial and of little use when the interconnections between the parts become more complex...Such complex systems cannot be treated as an interlaced set of more or less independent feedback circuits, but only as a whole. For understanding the general principles of dynamic systems, therefore, the concept of feedback is inadequate in itself. What is important is that complex systems, richly cross-connected internally, have complex behaviors, and that these behaviors can be goal-seeking in complex patterns. {{rp|page=54}} }}

== Overview ==
[[Image:105 Negative Feedback Loops.jpg|thumb|right|Feedback loops in the human body]]

In many physical and biological systems, qualitatively different influences can oppose each other. For example, in biochemistry, one set of chemicals drives the system in a given direction, whereas another set of chemicals drives it in an opposing direction. If one or both of these opposing influences are non-linear, equilibrium point(s) result.

In [[biology]], this process (in general, [[biochemistry|biochemical]]) is often referred to as [[homeostasis]]; whereas in [[mechanics]], the more common term is [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

In [[engineering]], [[mathematics]] and the physical, and biological sciences, common terms for the points around which the system gravitates include: attractors, [[stability theory|stable]] states, eigenstates/eigenfunctions, equilibrium points, and [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]s.

In [[control theory]], ''negative'' refers to the sign of the multiplier in mathematical models for feedback. In delta notation, −Δoutput is added to or mixed into the input. In multivariate systems, vectors help to illustrate how several influences can both partially complement and partially oppose each other.&lt;ref name=mindell/&gt;

Some authors, in particular with respect to modelling [[System dynamics|business systems]], use ''negative'' to refer to the reduction in difference between the desired and actual behavior of a system.&lt;ref name="Ramaprasad"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arkalgud Ramaprasad |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bs.3830280103/abstract |title=On The Definition of Feedback |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=4–13 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/bs.3830280103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sterman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a psychology context, on the other hand, ''negative'' refers to the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of the feedback – attractive versus aversive, or praise versus criticism.&lt;ref name=herold1977&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herold | first1 = David M. | last2 = Greller | first2 = Martin M. | year = 1977 | title = Research Notes.

In contrast, [[positive feedback]] is feedback in which the system responds so as to increase the magnitude of any particular perturbation, resulting in amplification of the original signal instead of stabilization. Any system in which there is positive feedback together with a gain greater than one will result in a runaway situation. Both positive and negative feedback require a feedback loop to operate.

However, negative feedback systems can still be subject to oscillations. This is caused by the slight delays around any loop. Due to these delays the feedback signal of some frequencies can arrive one half cycle later which will have a similar effect to positive feedback and these frequencies can reinforce themselves and grow over time. This problem is often dealt with by attenuating or changing the phase of the problematic frequencies. Unless the system naturally has sufficient damping, many negative feedback systems have [[low pass filter]]s or [[dashpot|dampers]] fitted.

== Some specific implementations ==
There are a large number of different examples of negative feedback and some are discussed below.

===Error-controlled regulation===
{{See also|Control engineering|Homeostasis|Allostasis}}
[[File:Regulator with feedback.png|thumb|200px|A regulator ''R'' adjusts the input to a system ''T'' so the monitored essential variables ''E'' are held to set-point values ''S'' that result in the desired system output despite disturbances ''D''.&lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhagade&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One use of feedback is to make a system (say ''T'') [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]] to minimize the effect of a disturbance (say ''D''). Using a negative feedback loop, a measurement of some variable (for example, a  [[process variable]], say ''E'') is [[Subtraction|subtracted]] from a required value (the [[Setpoint (control system)|'set point']]) to estimate an operational error in system status, which is then used by a [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulator]] (say ''R'') to reduce the gap between the measurement and the required value.&lt;ref name=Wilts&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The regulator modifies the input to the system ''T'' according to its interpretation of the error in the status of the system.  This error may be introduced by a variety of possible disturbances or 'upsets', some slow and some rapid.&lt;ref name= Svrcek&gt;
For example, input and load disturbances. See {{cite book |title=A Real-Time Approach to Process Control |author1=William Y. Svrcek |author2=Donald P. Mahoney |author3=Brent R. Young |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnFPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |page=57 |isbn=9781118684733 |year=2013 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Controller (control theory)|regulation]] in such systems can range from a simple 'on-off' control to a more complex processing of the error signal.&lt;ref name=Exeter&gt;
{{cite web |title= Types of feedback control |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/cdhw/Feedback/ControlTypes.html |publisher=University of Exeter: Physics and astronomy |work=Feedback and temperature control |author=Charles D H Williams|accessdate=2014-06-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be noted that the physical form of the signals in the system may change from point to point. So, for example, a change in weather may cause a disturbance to the ''heat'' input to a house (as an example of the system ''T'') that is monitored by a thermometer as a change in ''temperature'' (as an example of an 'essential variable' ''E''), converted by the thermostat (a 'comparator') into an ''electrical'' error in status compared to the 'set point' ''S'', and subsequently used by the regulator (containing a 'controller' that commands ''gas'' control valves and an ignitor) ultimately to change the ''heat'' provided by a furnace (an 'effector') to counter the initial weather-related disturbance in heat input to the house.

Error controlled regulation is typically carried out using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller ([[PID controller]]). The regulator signal is derived from a weighted sum of the error signal, integral of the error signal, and derivative of the error signal. The weights of the respective components depend on the application.&lt;ref name=Bechhoefer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783–835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783| citeseerx = 10.1.1.124.7043 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the regulator signal is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\left(\,{e(t)} + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_{0}^{t}{e(\tau)}\,{d\tau} + T_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where

The negative feedback amplifier was invented by [[Harold Stephen Black]] at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1927, and granted a patent in 1937 ([http://www.sos.siena.edu/~aweatherwax/electronics/black_patent.pdf US Patent 2,102,671] "a continuation of application Serial No. 298,155, filed August 8, 1928 ...").&lt;ref name=Brittain&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In design, the type of feedback and amount of feedback are carefully selected to weigh and optimize these various benefits.

Though negative feedback has many advantages, amplifiers with feedback can [[oscillate]]. See the article on [[Step response#Step response of feedback amplifiers|step response]]. They may even exhibit [[instability]]. [[Harry Nyquist]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] proposed the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] and the [[Nyquist plot]] that identify stable feedback systems, including amplifiers and control systems.

&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback is negative if &amp;beta;''A''&amp;thinsp;&gt;0.]]
The figure shows a simplified block diagram of a [[negative feedback amplifier]].

The feedback sets the overall (closed-loop) amplifier gain at a value:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{O}{I} =\frac {A}  { 1+\beta A }  \approx \frac {1}{\beta} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximate value assumes &amp;beta;''A '' &gt;&gt; 1. This expression shows that a gain greater than one requires &amp;beta; &lt; 1. Because the approximate gain 1/&amp;beta; is independent of the open-loop gain ''A'', the feedback is said to 'desensitize' the closed-loop gain to variations in ''A '' (for example, due to manufacturing variations between units, or temperature effects upon components), provided only that the gain ''A'' is sufficiently large.&lt;ref name=Kal3&gt;

If the disturbance ''D'' is included, the amplifier output becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;O =\frac {AI}  { 1+\beta A }  +\frac {D}{1+ \beta A} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the feedback reduces the effect of the disturbance by the 'improvement factor' (1+&amp;beta; ''A''). The disturbance ''D'' might arise from fluctuations in the amplifier output due to noise and nonlinearity (distortion) within this amplifier, or from other noise sources such as power supplies.&lt;ref name=Kal4&gt;

The difference signal ''I''–&amp;beta;''O'' at the amplifier input is sometimes called the "error signal".&lt;ref name=Rashid&gt;
{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22the+difference+between+the+input+and+the+feedback+signals,+called+the+error+signal%22&amp;num=10&amp;gws_rd=ssl |page=642 |author=Muhammad Rashid |title=Microelectronic Circuits: Analysis &amp; Design |isbn=9780495667728 |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=2nd  |year=2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to the diagram, the error signal is:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Error signal} = I - \beta O = I \left ( 1-\beta \frac{O}{I} \right ) =\frac {I} {1 + \beta A} - \frac { \beta D} {1+\beta A} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

From this expression, it can be seen that a large 'improvement factor' (or a large [[loop gain]] &amp;beta;''A'') tends to keep this error signal small.

Although the diagram illustrates the principles of the negative feedback amplifier, modeling a real amplifier as a [[Amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|unilateral forward amplification block]] and a unilateral feedback block has significant limitations.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;

[[File:Feedback op-amp voltage amplifier.png|thumb|200px|A feedback voltage amplifier using an op amp with finite gain but infinite input impedances and zero output impedance.&lt;ref name=Franco&gt;See, for example, Figure 1.4, p. 7 ''Ideal op amp model'' in {{cite book |title=Design with operational amplifiers and analog integrated circuits |edition=3rd |author=Sergio Franco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=em1BnAEACAAJ |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2002 |isbn=978-0078028168}} or {{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Circuits and Filters |editor=Wai-Kai Chen |author1=David G Nair |author2=Sergio B Franco |chapter=Figure 16.2: ''The four possible op-amp configurations'' |pages=16–2 |isbn=9781420058888 |year=2009 |publisher=CRC Press |edition=The Circuits and Filters Handbook, 3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UVb4cxL0c0C&amp;pg=SA16-PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The operational amplifier was originally developed as a building block for the construction of [[analog computers]], but is now used almost universally in all kinds of applications including [[audio signal|audio]] equipment and [[control systems]].

Operational amplifier circuits typically employ negative feedback to get a predictable transfer function. Since the open-loop gain of an op-amp is extremely large, a small differential input signal would drive the output of the amplifier to one rail or the other in the absence of negative feedback. A simple example of the use of feedback is the op-amp voltage amplifier shown in the figure.

The idealized model of an operational amplifier assumes that the gain is infinite, the input impedance is infinite, output resistance is zero, and input offset currents and voltages are zero. Such an ideal amplifier draws no current from the resistor divider.&lt;ref name=Schitter&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of High Performance Mechatronics |author1=G. Schitter |author2=A. Rankers |page=499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WvnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA499 |chapter=§6.3.4 Linear amplifiers with operational amplifiers |isbn=9781614993681 |year=2014 |publisher=IOS Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Ignoring dynamics (transient effects and [[propagation delay]]), the infinite gain of the ideal op-amp means this feedback circuit drives the voltage difference between the two op-amp inputs to zero.&lt;ref name=Schitter/&gt; Consequently, the voltage gain of the circuit in the diagram, assuming an ideal op amp, is the reciprocal of feedback [[Voltage divider|voltage division]] ratio &amp;beta;:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ R_{\text{1}} + R_{\text{2}} }{ R_{\text{1}} } V_{\text{in}}\!  = \frac{1}{\beta} V_{\text{in}} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

A real op-amp has a high but finite gain ''A'' at low frequencies, decreasing gradually at higher frequencies. In addition, it exhibits a finite input impedance and a non-zero output impedance. Although practical op-amps are not ideal, the model of an ideal op-amp often suffices to understand circuit operation at low enough frequencies. 
As discussed in the previous section, the feedback circuit stabilizes the closed-loop gain and desensitizes the output to fluctuations generated inside the amplifier itself.&lt;ref name= Jung&gt;

=== Mechanical engineering ===
{{See also|Control systems|Control engineering}}
[[File:Ballcock.svg|thumb|The [[ballcock]] or float valve uses negative feedback to control the water level in a cistern.]]
An example of the use of negative feedback control is the [[ballcock]] control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in [[fuel injection]] systems and [[carburettor]]s. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving [[air conditioners]], [[refrigerators]], or [[freezers]].

=== Biology and chemistry ===

[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|thumb|250pc|Control of endocrine hormones by negative feedback.]]

Some biological systems exhibit negative feedback such as the [[baroreflex]] in [[blood pressure]] regulation and [[erythropoiesis]]. Many biological process (e.g., in the [[human anatomy]]) use negative feedback. Examples of this are numerous, from the regulating of body temperature, to the regulating of blood [[glucose]] levels. The disruption of feedback loops can lead to undesirable results: in the case of blood glucose levels, if negative feedback fails, the glucose levels in the blood may begin to rise dramatically, thus resulting in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

For hormone secretion regulated by the negative feedback loop: when gland X releases hormone X, this stimulates target cells to release hormone Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y, gland X "senses" this and inhibits its release of hormone X. As shown in the figure, most [[endocrine]] [[hormone]]s are controlled by a [[physiology|physiologic]] negative feedback inhibition loop, such as the [[glucocorticoid]]s secreted by the [[adrenal cortex]].  The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)]], which directs the [[pituitary gland|anterior pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH|adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)]].  In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, such as [[cortisol]].  Glucocorticoids not only perform their respective functions throughout the body but also negatively affect the release of further stimulating secretions of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, effectively reducing the output of glucocorticoids once a sufficient amount has been released.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, PH; Johnson, GB. ''Biology'', Fifth Edition, Boston: Hill Companies, Inc. 1999. page 1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-organization===
{{main article|Self-organization|Emergence}}
Self-organization is the capability of certain systems "of organizing their own behavior or structure".&lt;ref name=Uttal&gt;
{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vil6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |author= William R. Uttal |title=Psychomythics: Sources of Artifacts and Misconceptions in Scientific Psychology |isbn=9781135623722 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2014 |pages=95 ''ff''}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There are many possible factors contributing to this capacity, and most often [[positive feedback]] is identified as a possible contributor. However, negative feedback also can play a role.&lt;ref name=Camazine&gt;
{{cite book |title=Self-organization in biological systems |author1=Scott Camazine |author2=Jean-Louis Deneubourg |author3=Nigel R Franks |author4=James Sneyd |author5=Guy Theraulaz |author6=Eric Bonabeau |chapter=Chapter 2: How self-organization works |pages=15 ''ff'' |isbn= 9780691116242 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMgyNN6Ufj0C&amp;pg=PA15}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===

In economics, [[automatic stabiliser]]s are government programs that are intended to work as negative feedback to dampen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

[[Mainstream economics]] asserts that the market pricing mechanism operates to match [[supply and demand]], because mismatches between them feed back into the decision-making of suppliers and demanders of goods, altering prices and thereby reducing any discrepancy. However [[Norbert Wiener]] wrote in 1948:
	
:''"There is a belief current in many countries and elevated to the rank of an official article of faith in the United States that free competition is itself a homeostatic process... Unfortunately the evidence, such as it is, is against this simple-minded theory."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]] p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of economic equilibrium being maintained in this fashion by market forces has also been questioned by numerous [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] economists such as [[financier]] [[George Soros]]&lt;ref&gt;Goeroge Soros, ''The Alchemy of Finance''&lt;/ref&gt; and leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]]  [[Herman Daly]], who was with the [[World Bank]] in 1988-1994.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Daly, ''Steady State Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative pledge''' is a provision in a [[contract]] which prohibits a party to the contract from creating any [[security interest]]s over certain property specified in the provision.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank ''[[pari passu]]'' with) the security of the first [[secured creditor]] under the security document in which the negative pledge appears.

In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by [[Hanson Australia|Pioneer Concrete]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor Sykes]], ''The Bold Riders'', second edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-86448-184-6}}, pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers.

Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an [[unsecured loan]], cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an [[event of default]].

A '''negative pregnant''' (sometimes called a '''pregnant denial''') refers to a denial which implies its affirmative opposite by seeming to deny only a qualification of the allegation and not the allegation itself.  For example, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars" might imply that the person making the statement owes some other sum of money, and was only denying that they owe that particular amount.  

A negative pregnant which appears in [[pleading]]s will often elicit a request for [[further and better particulars]], or an [[interrogatory]].  In order to avoid a negative pregnant in the above example, one might instead say, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars, or any other sum of money."

The issue can also arise in the context of [[statutory interpretation]]. For instance, Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] argues in his dissent to ''EEOC v. Aramco''&lt;ref&gt;''EEOC v. Aramco'' , 499 U.S. 244 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; that the presumption against [[extraterritoriality]] is rebutted by a negative inference from the alien-exemption provision of [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which states that Title VII "shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State." Marshall concludes that "Absent an intention that Title VII ''apply'' 'outside any State,' Congress would have had no reason to craft this extraterritorial exemption. And because only discrimination against aliens is exempted, employers remain accountable for discrimination against United States citizens abroad." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1838.ZD.html  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Co. (89-1838), at Cornell Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], '''negentropy''' is used as a measure of distance to normality.  The concept and phrase "negative entropy" was introduced by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his 1944 popular-science book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]''&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin, ''What is Life – the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell'', Cambridge University Press, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Léon Brillouin]] shortened the phrase to ''negentropy'',&lt;ref&gt;Brillouin, Leon: (1953) "Negentropy Principle of Information", ''J. of Applied Physics'', v. '''24(9)''', pp. 1152–1163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Léon Brillouin, ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', Masson, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; to express it in a more "positive" way: a living system imports negentropy and stores it.&lt;ref&gt;Mae-Wan Ho, [http://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php What is (Schrödinger's) Negentropy?], Bioelectrodynamics Laboratory, Open university Walton Hall, Milton Keynes&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] proposed replacing the term ''negentropy'' with ''syntropy''. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Fantappiè]], who tried to construct a unified theory of [[biology]] and [[physics]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] tried to popularize this usage, but ''negentropy'' remains common.

In a note to ''[[What is Life?]]'' Schrödinger explained his use of this phrase.
{{cquote|[...] if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

In 2009, Mahulikar &amp; Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-system as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to its surrounding chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Mahulikar, S.P. &amp; Herwig, H.: (2009) "Exact thermodynamic principles for dynamic order existence and evolution in chaos", ''Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals'', v. '''41(4)''', pp. 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negentropy has SI units of (J kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and (K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This definition enabled: ''i'') scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic order existence, ''ii'') formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic order existence and evolution, and ''iii'') mathematical interpretation of Schrödinger's negentropy debt.

==Information theory==
In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality.&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/NCS99web/node32.html Survey on Independent Component Analysis, node32: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen and Erkki Oja, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/IJCNN99_tutorialweb/node14.html Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial, node14: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruye Wang, [http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/ica/node4.html Independent Component Analysis, node4: Measures of Non-Gaussianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] with a given mean and variance, the normal or [[Gaussian distribution]] is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes [[if and only if]] the signal is Gaussian.

Negentropy is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;J(p_x) = S(\varphi_x) - S(p_x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(\varphi_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[differential entropy]] of the Gaussian density with the same [[mean]] and [[variance]] as &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(p_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the differential entropy of &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;S(p_x) = - \int p_x(u) \log p_x(u) \, du&lt;/math&gt;

Negentropy is used in [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]]. It is related to network [[Information entropy|entropy]], which is used in [[independent component analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Comon, Independent Component Analysis – a new concept?, ''Signal Processing'', '''36''' 287–314, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didier G. Leibovici and Christian Beckmann, [http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep/tr01dl1/tr01dl1/tr01dl1.html An introduction to Multiway Methods for Multi-Subject fMRI experiment], FMRIB Technical Report 2001, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Department of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way, Headington, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs' free energy==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|275px|thumb|right|[[Willard Gibbs]]’ 1873 '''available energy''' ([[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body. MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. Qε and Qη are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ε ([[internal energy]]) and η ([[entropy]]) respectively. AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' ([[Gibbs energy]]) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
There is a physical quantity closely linked to [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] ([[free enthalpy]]), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]] created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to [[free enthalpy]]. On the diagram one can see the quantity called [[capacity for entropy]]. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume.&lt;ref&gt;Willard Gibbs, [http://www.ufn.ru/ufn39/ufn39_4/Russian/r394b.pdf A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces], ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy'', 382–404 (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by [[François Jacques Dominique Massieu|Massieu]] for the [[isothermal process]]&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869a).

Applied Physics'' '''24''', 1152–1163 1953&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least kT ln(2) energy. This is the same energy as the work [[Leó Szilárd]]'s engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, ''Science and Information theory'', Dover, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">The '''principle of plenitude''' asserts that the universe contains all possible forms of existence.  The [[Intellectual history|historian of ideas]] [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|Arthur Lovejoy]] was the first to trace the history of this [[philosophy|philosophically]] important principle explicitly.  Lovejoy distinguishes two versions of the principle: a static version, in which the universe displays a constant fullness and diversity, and a temporalized version, in which fullness and diversity gradually increase over time.

Lovejoy traces the principle of plenitude to the writings of [[Plato]], finding in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' an insistence on "the necessarily complete translation of all the ideal possibilities into actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, he takes [[Aristotle]] to reject the principle in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', when he writes that "it is not necessary that everything that is possible should exist in actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, the principle of plenitude has had the following adherents:

*[[Epicurus]] reiterated the principle in fr.266 [[Hermann Usener|Us.]] His follower [[Lucretius]] (''DRN'' V 526-33 ) famously applied the principle to the sets of multiple explanations by which the Epicureans account for astronomical and meteorological phenomena: every possible explanation is also true, if not in our world, then elsewhere in the infinite universe.
*[[Augustine of Hippo]] brought the principle from [[Neo-Platonic]] thought into early Christian [[Theology]].
*[[St Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]]s for God's existence used the principle's implication that nature will become as complete as it possibly can be, to argue that existence is a "perfection" in the sense of a completeness or fullness.
*[[Thomas Aquinas]] accepted a modified form of the principle, but qualified it by making several distinctions that safeguard the freedom of God.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Giordano Bruno]]'s insistence on an infinity of worlds was not based on the theories of [[Copernicus]], or on observation, but on the principle applied to God. His death may then be attributed to his conviction of its truth.
*[[Spinoza]], according to Lovejoy, "expressed the principle of plenitude in its most uncompromising form" and "represented it as necessary in the strict logical sense".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] believed in the principle but not in the possibility of its empirical verification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19261">The '''principle of sufficient reason''' states that everything must have a [[Reason (argument)|reason]] or a [[cause]]. The modern&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:67" 
In modern times, the attention of philosophers was called to this law of Leibnitz, who, on the two principles of Reason and of Contradiction, founded the whole edifice of his philosophy.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See Théodicée, § 44. [[Monadology|Monadologie]], §§ 81, 82. —ED."&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of the principle is usually attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in [[Anselm of Canterbury]]: his phrase [http://12koerbe.de/pan/curdeus5.htm ''quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit''] and the formulation of the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. A clearer connection is with the [[cosmological argument for the existence of God]]. The principle can be seen in both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]]. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in [[A. O. Lovejoy]], ''The Great Chain of Being''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including [[Anaximander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|page= 152|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parmenides]], [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"&gt;{{cite web |title= Principle of Sufficient Reason |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"/&gt; [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kara|title=Avicenna and the Principle of Sufficient Reason|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=4|pages=743–768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spinoza |last=Della Rocca |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0415283302 |pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with "''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss (2007) "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason" in ''Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy'' Ch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton attributes this expression to [[Cicero]]; Hamilton 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] identified the laws of inference [[modus ponens]] with the "law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent" and [[modus tollens]] with its [[contrapositive]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:241–242: “2°, "If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, – that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, – If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent." &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: ''Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio''. Or, otherwise, ''a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia''. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of ''modus ponens'', the other of the ''modus tollens''. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. —ED. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; See Kant, Logik §§ 75–76 . Krug, Logik, § 82. —ED." See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity ''X'', if ''X'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''X'' exists.
*For every event ''E'', if ''E'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''E'' occurs.
*For every proposition ''P'', if ''P'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''P'' is true.

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of ''reasons'' or ''causes,'' for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration|date=March 2016}}, however, depending on which interpretation is given.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to [[axiom]]s within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system
&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;. 
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be [[deductive reasoning|deducible]] from the set axioms at the base of the construction (with some theoretical exceptions: see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]]).

==Leibniz's view==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the [[law of identity]] (and the [[principle of contradiction]]): "Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhit|first=Abdul|title=Leibniz on Necessary and Contingent Truths|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/AFJ/article/download/12936/9300|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction.&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"/&gt;

Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of [[infinitary]] reasons, to which [[God]] had access but humans did not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=G. W. Leibniz:  Philosophical Essays|year=1989|publisher=Hackett |location=Indianapolis|editors=Ariew, Roger and Daniel Garber, eds and trans}}, p. 94, ''On Freedom'' (1689?).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of [[closed system]], in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of [[Buridan's ass]].  Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17147 ''Theodicy'', pg. 150])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of [[absolute space and time|absolute space]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space.  Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=H.G. |title=The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence |date=1956 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised [[laws of thought]], that held a place in European [[pedagogy]] of [[logic]] and [[reasoning]] (and, to some extent, [[philosophy]] in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of [[Leo Tolstoy]], amongst others, in the elevated form that [[history]] could not be accepted as [[random]].

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called ''necessary conditions'').&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T. Hobbes, ''Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum'', 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, [[On the Freedom of the Will]], c. 4. See also: [[John Bramhall]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions.

===Hamilton's fourth law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here is how [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]], circa 1837–1838,&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface: "The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837–8)." The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by "—ED." by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his "fourth law" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:"'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, – ED.&lt;ref&gt;From the index: "SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T." These are philosophers [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] (23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug]] (22 June 1770 – 12 January 1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:"'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science."

==Schopenhauer's Four Forms==
{{main|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason}}
According to [[Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; "I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings "must be produced by an act of will which has a motive." As his proposition in 43 states, "Motivation is causality seen from within."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed proofs of universal validity==
{{See also|Free will#Free will and views of causality|label 1=Views of causality (from the article on free will)}}
Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least ''in general'', in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. The two famous arguments or proofs were proposed by Immanuel Kant (from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and "directionality" of time) and by Arthur Schopenhauer (by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect).

Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an "arrow of time") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), ''backwards'' causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the [[paradox of free will]] (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The figure shows the four stages of the PCM - awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. On each stage, there is a horizontal decision making process. Inputs (green arrows) influence the internal processing (blue boxes) that creates outputs (yellow arrows). The outcomes are shown in the four different stages of the PCM (grey boxes). The unique decision making process is based upon the level of involvement of the consumer towards a sport/team/event. The following sequence is shown in each stage:

Inputs --&gt; Internal Processing &lt;--&gt; Output

The PCM framework states that, through the processing of internal and external inputs, individuals progress upward along the four psychological connection stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lock, D., Darcy, S., &amp; Taylor, T.| year=2009| title= ''Starting with a clean slate: An analysis of member identification with a new sports team''| publisher = Sport Management Review, 12, 15-25..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall evaluation of an object at a specific stage is the product of the processing of personal, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C.

==Stages==

===Awareness===

|image        = '''John's Awareness'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John’s introduction to road cycling occurred at the age of 15 through a key socialising agent, his uncle Jack. Jack bought John his first bike, which he rode to school every day. When John was 15 and saw the Tour the France on television, he was amazed by the event. When Jack gave John one of his old road bikes and took him cycling on the weekend, John's progression to the Attraction stage began.
}}
[[Awareness]] stands for the notion when an individual first learns that a certain sport, event or team exists. In this stage the individual has not formed a preference or favourite. The PCM suggests that awareness of sport, teams and events stems from formal and informal channels, for examples parents, friends, school and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Funk, D. C.| year=2002| title= Consumer-based marketing: The use of micro-segmentation strategies for understanding sport consumption| journal = [[International Journal of Sports Marketing &amp; Sponsorship]] |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=231–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases awareness begins during [[childhood]], but can also derive from other socializing agents. The value placed on the specific sport and event from a societal perspective is important in the awareness stage. The examples of ''I know about football'' and ''I know about Liverpool FC'' illustrate the awareness stage box.

===Attraction===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attraction'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John began to realize that cycling provided him a number of positive outcomes. He was able to meet other cyclists, make new friends and spend time with his uncle. He received pleasure from riding outside and the thrill of riding down hills at fast speed. His self-esteem rose by getting into shape and being one of the fastest riders among his friends. He also enjoyed the break from his daily routine when riding the bike. }}

In the attraction stage, the individual has a favourite sport, event, team or leisure hobby.   Attraction is based upon a number of extrinsic and intrinsic motives.  In other words,  the sport, event, or leisure hobby provides the opportunity to satisfy needs and receive benefits. The motives stem from a combination of personal, psychological and environmental factors. The Attraction processing creates outcomes of positive affect and intentions, as well as engaging in consumption behaviour related to the sport and event. The examples of ''I like football'' and ''I like Liverpool FC'' illustrate the attraction stage box.

===Attachment===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attachment'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progresses into the attachment stage relatively quickly and within a year begins riding every Saturday and Sunday morning. Cycling now is an important part in his life. He often wears cycling clothes to class, spent time visiting bike shops and uses the Internet to follow international cycling events. He even joins a cycling club and travels to regional cycling competitions with his friends who are predominantly cyclists.
}}

In the attachment stage the benefits and the sport object are internalised taking on a collective emotional, functional, and symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Filo, K., Funk, D.C., &amp; O’Brien, D.| year=2009| title= ''The Meaning Behind Attachment: Exploring Camaraderie, Cause, and Competency at a Charity Sport Event''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 23, 361-387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological connection towards a sport, event, team or leisure hobby strengthens. Internal processes become more important and the influence of socializing agents decreases. Examples for the attachment stage are ''I am a football player'' or ''I am a Liverpool Fan''.

===Allegiance===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Allegiance'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progressed into the allegiance stage during his last year of college as the strength of his connection to cycling became durable. He thought of cycling and related activities daily. He always found time to ride and follow the sport regardless of university and work requirements or other sport opportunities. John’s psychological connection to cycling has strengthened and is now guiding his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Funk, D.C., &amp; James, J.| year=2006| title= ''Consumer Loyalty: The Meaning of Attachment in the Development of Sport Team Allegiance''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 20, 189-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the attachment processing continues, the internal collective meaning becomes more durable in terms of persistence and resistance and has greater impact on activities and behaviour. This is noted by the examples of ''I live for football'' and ''I live for Liverpool FC'' within the allegiance stage.

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447–8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268–285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333–359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15–17 Sept 1997 |pages=18–36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond – a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115–39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985–1986 |volume=21 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K. J. |last2=Mnjama |first2=N. M. |last3=Sebina |first3=P. M. I. M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110–130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136–149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253–300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mediated Recordkeeping: culture-as-evidence (Leisa Gibbons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbons |first=L.

The '''revelation principle''' is a fundamental principle in [[mechanism design]]. It states that if a [[social choice function]] can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism (i.e. if that mechanism has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to the outcome of the social choice function), then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism (i.e. in which players [[Incentive compatibility|truthfully report]] type) with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs).&lt;ref name="AGT"&gt;{{Cite Algorithmic Game Theory 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

In [[mechanism design]], the revelation principle is of utmost importance in finding solutions. The researcher need only look at the set of equilibrium characterized by [[incentive compatibility]]. That is, if the mechanism designer wants to implement some outcome or property, he can restrict his search to mechanisms in which agents are willing to reveal their private information to the mechanism designer that has that outcome or property. If no such direct and truthful mechanism exists, no mechanism can implement this outcome/property. By narrowing the area needed to be searched, the problem of finding a mechanism becomes much easier.

The principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatibility]]:
*The ''dominant-strategy revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in [[Strategic dominance|dominant-strategies]] can be implemented by a  [[Strategyproofness|dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC)]] mechanism (introduced by [[Allan Gibbard]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard, A. 1973. Manipulation of voting schemes: a general result. Econometrica 41, 587–601.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*The ''Bayesian-Nash revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium ([[Bayesian game]], i.e. game of incomplete information) can be implemented by a [[Incentive compatibility|Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatibility (BNIC)]] mechanism. This broader solution concept was introduced by Dasgupta, Hammond and [[Eric Maskin|Maskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, P., Hammond, P. and Maskin, E. 1979. The implementation of social choice rules: some results on incentive compatibility. Review of Economic Studies 46, 185–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmstrom,&lt;ref&gt;Holmstrom, B. 1977. On incentives and control in organizations. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, R. 1979. Incentive-compatibility and the bargaining problem. Econometrica 47, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider the following example. There is a certain item that Alice values as &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob values as &lt;math&gt;v_B&lt;/math&gt;. The government needs to decide who will receive that item and in what terms. 
* A ''social-choice-function'' is a function that maps a set of individual ''preferences'' to a social outcome. An example function is the [[utilitarian]] function, which says "give the item to a person that values it the most". We denote a social choice function by '''Soc''' and its recommended outcome given a set of preferences by '''Soc(Prefs)'''.
* A ''mechanism'' is a rule that maps a set of individual ''actions'' to a social outcome. A mechanism '''Mech''' induces a [[game theory|game]] which we denote by '''Game(Mech)'''.
* A mechanism '''Mech''' is said to ''implement'' a social-choice-function '''Soc''' if, for every combination of individual preferences, there is a [[Nash equilibrium]] in '''Game(Mech)''' in which the outcome is '''Soc(Prefs)'''. Two example mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says a number between 1 and 10. The item is given to the individual who says the lowest number; if both say the same number, then the item is given to Alice". This mechanism does NOT implement the utilitarian function, since for every individual who wants the item, it is a dominant strategy to say "1" regardless of his/her true value. This means that in equilibrium the item is always given to Alice, even if Bob values it more.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is a mechanism which implements the utilitarian function. For example, if &lt;math&gt;v_B&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt;, then any action profile in which Bob bids more than Alice and both bids are in the range &lt;math&gt;(v_A,v_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash-equilibrium in which the item goes to Bob. Additionally, if the valuations of Alice and Bob are random variables drawn independently from the same distribution, then there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] in which the item goes to the bidder with the highest value.
* A ''direct-mechanism'' is a mechanism in which the set of actions available to each player is just the set of possible preferences of the player. 
* A direct-mechanism '''Mech''' is said to be ''Bayesian-Nash-[[Incentive-compatible]] (BNIC)'' if there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] of '''Game(Mech)''' in which all players reveal their true preferences. Some example direct-mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says how much he values the item. The item is given to the individual that said the highest value. In case of a tie, the item is given to Alice". This mechanism is NOT BNIC, since a player who wants the item is better-off by saying the highest possible value, regardless of his true value.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is also NOT BNIC, since the winner is always better-off by bidding the lowest value that is slightly above the loser's bid.
** However, if the distribution of the players' valuations is known, then there is [[First-price sealed-bid auction#Incentive-compatible_variant|a variant]] which is BNIC and implements the utilitarian function.
** Moreover, it is known that [[Second price auction]] is BNIC (it is even IC in a stronger sense - dominant-strategy IC). Additionally, it implements the utilitarian function.

== Proof ==
Suppose we have an arbitrary mechanism '''Mech''' that implements '''Soc'''.

We construct a direct mechanism '''Mech'''' that is truthful and implements '''Soc'''.

'''Mech'''' simply simulates the equilibrium strategies of the players in Game('''Mech'''). I.e:
* '''Mech'''' asks the players to report their valuations.
* Based on the reported valuations, '''Mech'''' calculates, for each player, his equilibrium strategy in '''Mech'''.
* '''Mech'''' returns the outcome returned by '''Mech'''.

Reporting the true valuations in '''Mech'''' is like playing the equilibrium strategies in '''Mech'''. Hence, reporting the true valuations is a Nash equilibrium in '''Mech'''', as desired. Moreover, the equilibrium payoffs are the same, as desired.

==In correlated equilibrium==
The revelation principle says that for every arbitrary ''coordinating device'' a.k.a. correlating there exists another direct device for which the state space equals the action space of each player.  Then the coordination is done by directly informing each player of his action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19944">{{Network neutrality}}

'''Search neutrality''' is a [[principle]] that [[search engine]]s should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain [[bias]]. 
 
Search neutrality is related to [[network neutrality]] in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the [[organic search]] results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

==Background==
The term "search neutrality" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, "Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets"&lt;ref name="odlyzko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odlyzko|first1=Andrew|title=Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets|journal=Review of Network Economics|date=March 2009|pages=40-60|url=https://www.bsi.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/rne81.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be "the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices &lt;ref name=raff1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as "search neutrality" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality&lt;ref name="raff1" /&gt;.

In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as "what is search neutrality?" or "what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality &lt;ref name=grimmelmann&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742444|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|work=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435-461|accessdate=5 July 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). "Relevance" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.

Search neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of search bias by other companies.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title="Neutral" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1–12|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines. Sites like [[Amazon.com]] and [[Facebook]] are also accused of skewing results.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shavin|first1=Naomi|title=Are Google and Amazon the next threat to net neutrality?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomishavin/2014/07/02/are-google-and-amazon-the-next-threat-to-net-neutrality/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon’s search results are influenced by companies that pay to rank higher in their search results while Facebook filters their newsfeed lists to conduct social experiments.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

== "Vertical search" spam penalties ==
In order to find information on the Web, most users make use of [[search engines]], which [[web crawler|crawl the web]], index it and show a list of results ordered by relevance. The use of search engines to access information through the web has become a key factor for [[online business]]es companies, which depend on the flow of users visiting their pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingtoday.com/emarketing/0305/b2b_importance_sem.htm| title=Search Engine Marketing | publisher=Marketing Today | year=2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies is Foundem. Foundem provides a "[[vertical search]]" service to compare products available on online markets for the U.K. Many people see these "vertical search" sites as spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antitrust nemesis accuses Google of 'WMD program'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/01/foundem_accuses_google_of_wmd_program_against_vertical_search_rivals/|work=The Register|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Cade Metz|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006 and for three and a half years following, Foundem’s traffic and business dropped significantly due to what they assert to be a penalty deliberately applied by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story| title=Foundem’s Google Story| publisher=www.searchneutrality.org| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127070002/http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story |archivedate=27 January 2010 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether their claim of a penalty was self-imposed via their use of iframe HTML tags to embed the content from other websites.  At the time at which Foundem claims the penalties were imposed, it was unclear whether web crawlers crawled beyond the main page of a website using iframe tags without some extra modifications. The former SEO director OMD UK, Jaamit Durrani, among others, offered this alternative explanation, stating that “Two of the major issues that Foundem had in summer was content in iFrames and content requiring javascript to load – both of which I looked at in August, and they were definitely in place. Both are huge barriers to search visibility in my book. They have been fixed somewhere between then and the lifting of the supposed ‘penalty’. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title = Foundem vs Google redux: it was a penalty! And search neutrality is at stake, dammit!|url=https://econsultancy.com/blog/5183-foundem-vs-google-redux-it-was-a-penalty-and-search-neutrality-is-at-stake-dammit/|author=Chris Lake|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of Foundem’s accusations claim that Google deliberately applies penalties to other vertical search engines because they represent competition.&lt;ref name="policyBlog"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/02/committed-to-competing-fairly.html | title=Committed to competing fairly| publisher=[[Google]] | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundem is backed by a Microsoft proxy group, the 'Initiative for Competitive Online Marketplace'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Conducting Antitrust Review of Google|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/204857/texas_conducting_antitrust_review_of_google.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG Consumer and SMB|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Nancy Gohring|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other cases====
[[Google]]'s large market share (85%) has made them a target for search neutrality litigation via [[antitrust laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/ | title=Background to EU Formal Investigation | publisher=foundem | date=November 30, 2010 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, Google released an article on the Google Public Policy blog expressing their concern for fair competition, when other companies at the UK joined Foundem's cause (eJustice.fr, and Microsoft's Ciao! from Bing) also claiming being unfairly penalized by Google.&lt;ref name="policyBlog" /&gt;

===The FTC’s Investigation into Allegations of Search Bias===

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Agrees to Change Its Business Practices to Resolve FTC Competition Concerns In the Markets for Devices Like Smart Phones, Games and Tablets, and in Online Search|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/01/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC concluded that Google’s “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt; The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

== Arguments ==
There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.

=== Pros ===
* Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2011/02/search-neutrality-as-disclosure-and-auditing.html | title=Search Neutrality as Disclosure and Auditing | publisher=Concurring Opinions | date=February 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.
* Restrains search engines from only supporting their best advertisers.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"/&gt;
* Search engines would allow traffic to sites that depend on visitors, keeping their results comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html?_r=1 | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=Bucknell.edu | date=December 27, 2009 | accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"&gt;{{cite book | last=Grimmelmann | first=James | chapterurl=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=james_grimmelmann | title=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet | chapter=Some Skepticism About Search Neutrality | publisher=TechFreedom | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows for organized, logical manipulation of search results by an objective, automatic algorithm.  At the same time, disallowing underhanded ranking of results on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"/&gt;
* Personalized search results might suppress information that disagrees with users' [[worldview]]s, isolating them in their own cultural or ideological "[[filter bubble]]s".&lt;ref name=twsT43&gt;{{cite news|first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore|title= The Filter Bubble|work= The Atlantic|quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone. So when I had two friends this spring Google "BP," one of them got a set of links that was about investment opportunities in BP. The other one got information about the oil spill....|date=  October 10, 2010|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/10/the-filter-bubble/181427/|accessdate= April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cons ===
*Forcing search engines to treat all websites equally would lead to the removal of their biased look at the Internet. A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the "best" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the "biased" or "subjective" results to fit their needs.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry "foul play," but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;

[[Google]]’s "[[Google Search|Universal Search]]" system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google 2.0: Google Universal Search|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-20-google-universal-search-11232|work=Search Engine Land|publisher=Third Door Media, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Danny Sullivan|date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been identified as one of the least neutral search engine practices,{{according to whom|date=November 2011}} and following the implementation of Universal Search websites, such as [[MapQuest]], the company experienced a massive decline in web traffic. This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/universalsearch_20070516.html | title=Google Begins Move to Universal Search | publisher=[[Google]] | date=May 17, 2007| accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://searchengineland.com/google-maps-gaining-on-market-leader-mapquest-13103 | title=Google Maps Gaining On Market Leader Mapquest | publisher=Search Engine Land | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not. Bing displays Microsoft content in first place more than twice as often as Google shows Google content in first place. This indicates that as far as there is any 'bias', Google is less biased than its principal competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|url=http://www.laweconcenter.org/images/articles/definingmeasuring.pdf|work=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|publisher=International Center for Law and Economics|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Joshua D.

In the system of [[Aristotelian logic]], the '''triangle of opposition''' is a diagram representing the different ways in which each of the three propositions of the system is logically related ('opposed') to each of the others. The system is also useful in the analysis of syllogistic logic, serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31232">A '''truth table''' is a [[mathematical table]] used in [[logic]]—specifically in connection with [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[boolean function]]s, and [[propositional calculus]]—which sets out the functional values of logical [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables ([[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]], 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]].

A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, P and Q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, P XOR Q). Each row of the truth table contains one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, P=true Q=false), and the result of the operation for those values. See the examples below for further clarification. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is often credited with inventing the truth table in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] | title = Ludwig Wittgenstein, A Biographical Sketch | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | year = 1955 | pages = 527–545 (p. 532, note 9) | jstor = 2182631 | doi=10.2307/2182631}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it appeared at least a year earlier in a paper on propositional logic by [[Emil Leon Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Emil Post]]|title=Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|date=July 1921|volume=43|issue=3|pages=163–185|jstor= 2370324|doi=10.2307/2370324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unary operations==

There are 4 unary operations:
*Always true
*Never true, unary ''[[falsum]]''
*Unary ''Identity'' 
*Unary ''negation'' 

===Logical true===
The output value is always true, regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical True'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''T''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T ||  T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}
===Logical false===
The output value is never true: that is, always false,  regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical False'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical identity===
[[Identity function|Logical identity]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]] p, for which the output value remains p.

The truth table for the logical identity operator is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Identity'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical negation===
[[Logical negation]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' if its operand is false and a value of ''false'' if its operand is true.

The truth table for '''NOT p''' (also written as '''¬p''', '''Np''', '''Fpq''', or '''~p''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Negation'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''¬p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}


==Binary operations==

There are 16  possible [[truth function]]s of two [[binary variable]]s:

===Truth table for all binary logical operators===
Here is an extended truth table giving definitions of all possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Information about notation may be found in [[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] (1959), [[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] (2001), and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:T = true.
:F = false.
:The '''Com''' row indicates whether an operator, '''op''', is [[Commutative property|commutative]] - '''P op Q = Q op P'''.
:The '''L id''' row shows the operator's [[left identity|left identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''I op Q = Q'''.
:The '''R id''' row shows the operator's [[right identity|right identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''P op I = P'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The operators here with equal left and right identities (XOR, AND, XNOR, and OR) are also [[monoid#Commutative_monoid|commutative monoids]] because they are also [[Associative_property|associative]]. While this distinction may be irrelevant in a simple discussion of logic, it can be quite important in more advanced mathematics. For example, in [[category theory]] an [[enriched category]] is described as a base [[category (mathematics)|category]] enriched over a monoid, and any of these operators can be used for enrichment.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four combinations of input values for p, q, are read by row from the table above.
The output function for each  p, q combination, can be read, by row, from the table.

'''Key:'''

The following table is oriented by column, rather than by row. There are four columns rather than four rows, to display the four combinations of p, q, as input. 

'''p''': T T F F&lt;br&gt;
'''q''': T F T F

There are 16 rows in this key, one row for each binary function of the two binary variables, p, q. For example, in row 2 of this Key, the value of [[Converse nonimplication]] ('&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;') is solely T, for the column denoted by the unique combination p=F, q=T; while  in row 2, the value of that '&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;' operation is F for the three remaining columns of p, q. The output row for &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; is thus

2: F F T F

and the 16-row&lt;ref name=tlp5.101/&gt; key is

Logical operators can also be visualized using [[Venn diagram#Overview|Venn diagram]]s.

===Logical conjunction (AND)===
[[Logical conjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are true.

The truth table for '''p AND q''' (also written as '''p ∧ q''', '''Kpq''', '''p &amp; q''', or '''p''' &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; '''q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Conjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∧ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

In ordinary language terms, if both ''p'' and ''q'' are true, then the conjunction ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is true.  For all other assignments of logical values to ''p'' and to ''q'' the conjunction ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'' is false.

It can also be said that if ''p'', then ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''q'', otherwise ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''p''.

===Logical disjunction (OR)===
[[Logical disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p OR q''' (also written as '''p ∨ q''', '''Apq''', '''p || q''', or '''p + q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∨ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

Stated in English, if ''p'', then ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''p'', otherwise ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''q''.

===Logical implication===
Logical implication and the [[material conditional]] are both associated with an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, which produces a value of ''false'' if the first operand is true and the second operand is false, and  a value of ''true'' otherwise.

The truth table associated with the logical implication '''p implies q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''', or more rarely '''Cpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Implication'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⇒ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The truth table associated with the material conditional '''if p then q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Material Conditional '''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' → ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It may also be useful to note that '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''' and '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''' are equivalent to '''¬p&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;q'''.

===Logical equality===
[[Logical equality]] (also known as biconditional) is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both operands are false or both operands are true.

The truth table for '''p XNOR q''' (also written as '''p ↔ q''', '''Epq''', '''p = q''', or '''p ≡ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equality'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↔ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

So p EQ q is true if p and q have the same [[truth value]] (both true or both false), and false if they have different truth values.

===Exclusive disjunction===
[[Exclusive disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if one but not both of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p XOR q''' (also written as '''p ⊕ q''', '''Jpq''', '''p ≠ q''', or '''p ↮ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Exclusive Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⊕ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

For two propositions, '''XOR''' can also be written as (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q).

===Logical NAND===
The [[logical NAND]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''false'' if both of its operands are true.  In other words, it produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is false.

The truth table for '''p NAND q''' (also written as '''p ↑ q''', '''Dpq''', or '''p | q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NAND'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↑ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It is frequently useful to express a logical operation as a compound operation, that is, as an operation that is built up or composed from other operations.  Many such compositions are possible, depending on the operations that are taken as basic or "primitive" and the operations that are taken as composite or "derivative".

In the case of logical NAND, it is clearly expressible as a compound of NOT and AND.

The negation of a conjunction: ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the disjunction of negations: (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:15%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:15%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:15%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:15%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

===Logical NOR===
The [[logical NOR]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of ''false'' if at least one of its operands is true. ↓ is also known as the [[Peirce arrow]] after its inventor, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and is a [[Sole sufficient operator]].

The truth table for '''p NOR q''' (also written as '''p ↓ q''', or '''Xpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NOR'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↓ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The negation of a disjunction ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the conjunction of negations (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:10%" | ''p''
! style="width:10%" | ''q''
! style="width:10%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:10%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:10%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:10%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:10%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

Inspection of the tabular derivations for NAND and NOR, under each assignment of logical values to the functional arguments ''p'' and ''q'', produces the identical patterns of functional values for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q''), and for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'').  Thus the first and second expressions in each pair are logically equivalent, and may be substituted for each other in all contexts that pertain solely to their logical values.

This equivalence is one of [[De Morgan's laws]].

==Applications==
Truth tables can be used to prove many other [[logical equivalence]]s.  For example, consider the following truth table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equivalence : &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow q) \equiv (\lnot p \lor q)&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T

This demonstrates the fact that &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Truth table for most commonly used logical operators===
Here is a truth table that gives definitions of the 6 most commonly used out of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Propositions 4.*-5.*|the 16 possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\lor} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\land} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;  ||  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F 
|-

|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F  || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|}

where

:T = true
:F = false
:&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conjunction|AND]] (logical conjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical disjunction|OR]] (logical disjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\lor}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive or|XOR]] (exclusive or) &lt;!-- this could be "+" instead according to other articles --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\land}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive nor|XNOR]] (exclusive nor)
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conditional|conditional "if-then"]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; = conditional "then-if"
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[if and only if|biconditional "if-and-only-if"]].

===Condensed truth tables for binary operators===
For binary operators, a condensed form of truth table is also used, where the row headings and the column headings specify the operands and the table cells specify the result. For example, [[Boolean logic]] uses this condensed truth table notation:

{|
|-
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∧ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || F
|-
! T
| F || T
|}
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∨ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || T
|-
! T
| T || T
|}
|}

This notation is useful especially if the operations are commutative, although one can additionally specify that the rows are the first operand and the columns are the second operand. This condensed notation is particularly useful in discussing multi-valued extensions of logic, as it significantly cuts down on combinatoric explosion of the number of rows otherwise needed. It also provides for quickly recognizable characteristic "shape" of the distribution of the values in the table which can assist the reader in grasping the rules more quickly.

===Truth tables in digital logic===
Truth tables are also used to specify the function of [[Lookup table#Hardware LUTs|hardware look-up tables (LUTs)]] in [[Digital circuit|digital logic circuitry]]. For an n-input LUT, the truth table will have 2^''n'' values (or rows in the above tabular format), completely specifying a boolean function for the LUT. By representing each boolean value as a [[bit]] in a [[Binary numeral system|binary number]], truth table values can be efficiently encoded as [[integer]] values in [[Electronic design automation|electronic design automation (EDA)]] [[software]]. For example, a 32-bit integer can encode the truth table for a LUT with up to 5 inputs.

When using an integer representation of a truth table, the output value of the LUT can be obtained by calculating a bit index ''k'' based on the input values of the LUT, in which case the LUT's output value is the ''k''th bit of the integer. For example, to evaluate the output value of a LUT given an [[Array data structure|array]] of ''n'' boolean input values, the bit index of the truth table's output value can be computed as follows: if the ''i''th input is true, let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, else let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''k''th bit of the binary representation of the truth table is the LUT's output value, where &lt;math&gt;k = V_0 \times 2^0 + V_1 \times 2^1 + V_2 \times 2^2 + \dots + V_n \times 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Truth tables are a simple and straightforward way to encode boolean functions, however given the [[exponential growth]] in size as the number of inputs increase, they are not suitable for functions with a large number of inputs. Other representations which are more memory efficient are text equations and [[binary decision diagram]]s.

===Applications of truth tables in digital electronics===
In digital electronics and computer science (fields of applied logic engineering and mathematics), truth tables can be used to reduce basic boolean operations to simple correlations of inputs to outputs, without the use of [[logic gate]]s or code. For example, a binary addition can be represented with the truth table:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B | C R
1 1 | 1 0
1 0 | 0 1
0 1 | 0 1
0 0 | 0 0

where

A = First Operand
B = Second Operand
C = Carry
R = Result
&lt;/pre&gt;

This truth table is read left to right:
* Value pair (A,B) equals value pair (C,R).
* Or for this example, A plus B equal result R, with the Carry C.

Note that this table does not describe the logic operations necessary to implement this operation, rather it simply specifies the function of inputs to output values.

With respect to the result, this example may be arithmetically viewed as modulo 2 binary addition, and as logically equivalent to the exclusive-or (exclusive disjunction) binary logic operation.

In this case it can be used for only very simple inputs and outputs, such as 1s and 0s. However, if the number of types of values one can have on the inputs increases, the size of the truth table will  increase.

For instance, in an addition operation, one needs two operands, A and B. Each can have one of two values, zero or one. The number of combinations of these two values is 2×2, or four. So the result is four possible outputs of C and R.  If one were to use base 3, the size would increase to 3×3, or nine possible outputs.

The first "addition" example above is called a half-adder. A full-adder is when the carry from the previous operation is provided as input to the next adder. Thus, a truth table of eight rows would be needed to describe a [[full adder]]'s logic:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B C* | C R
0 0 0  | 0 0
0 1 0  | 0 1
1 0 0  | 0 1
1 1 0  | 1 0
0 0 1  | 0 1
0 1 1  | 1 0
1 0 1  | 1 0
1 1 1  | 1 1

Same as previous, but..
C* = Carry from previous adder
&lt;/pre&gt;

==History==
Irving Anellis has done the research to show that [[C.S. Peirce]] appears to be the earliest logician (in 1893) to devise a truth table matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anellis|first1=Irving H.|title=Peirce's Truth-functional Analysis and the Origin of the Truth Table|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|date=2012|volume=33|pages=87–97|doi=10.1080/01445340.2011.621702}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the summary of his paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In 1997, John Shosky discovered, on the verso of a page of the typed transcript of Bertrand Russell's 1912 lecture on "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" truth table matrices. The matrix for negation is Russell's, alongside of which is the matrix for material implication in the hand of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is shown that an unpublished manuscript identified as composed by Peirce in 1893 includes a truth table matrix that is equivalent to the matrix for material implication discovered by John Shosky. An unpublished manuscript by Peirce identified as having been composed in 1883–84 in connection with the composition of Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation" that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' in 1885 includes an example of an indirect truth table for the conditional. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Selfref|Regarding the use–mention distinction when writing Wikipedia articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Text formatting|Words as words}} and {{section link|Wikipedia:Writing better articles|Use of "refers to"}}.}}

The '''use–mention distinction''' is a [[foundational]] concept of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (2005) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; according to which it is necessary to make a [[Dichotomy|distinction]] between {{em|using}} a word (or phrase) and {{em|mentioning}} it,&lt;ref name="Devitt99"&gt;Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"&gt;[[W.V. Quine]] (1940) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention".&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt; The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"/&gt;

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word ''cheese'':&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"/&gt;
* ''Use'': Cheese is derived from milk.
* ''Mention'': 'Cheese' is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''ċēse''.

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called "cheese"; it &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; it &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt; the word without &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to refer to anything other than itself.

== Grammar ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

In written language, '''mentioned''' words or phrases often appear between [[quotation mark]]s (as in {{" '}}Chicago' contains three vowels") or in [[italics]] (as in "When I say ''honey'', I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as ''[[Strunk and White]]'' insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. '''Used''' words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Shomir|title=A Computational Theory of the Use-Mention Distinction in Natural Language|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11694|publisher=Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:
* When Larry said, "That has three letters," he was referring to the word 'bee'.
* With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that "The term refers to an umbrella."

A few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders.'' 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that "philosophers" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
The general phenomenon of a term's having different [[references]] in different contexts was called ''[[Supposition Theory|suppositio]]'' (substitution)  by medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;See Read, Stephen (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms]. In [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:
* Properly with a ''[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and real referent'': "That is my ''pig''" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''concrete but unreal referent'': "Santa Claus's pig is very big." (also personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''generic referent'': "Any ''pig'' breathes air." (simple supposition)
* Improperly by way of ''metaphor'': "Your grandfather is a ''pig''". (improper supposition)
* As a ''pure term'': "''Pig'' has only three letters". (material supposition)

The last sentence contains a mention example.

The use–mention distinction is especially important in [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotation|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/#2.2|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or [[meaningless statement]]s or [[category error]]s. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:
* "Copper" contains six letters, and is not a metal.
* Copper is a metal, and contains no letters.

The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word "copper" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing.  The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the [[fallacy]] that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Peter|title=[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2nd edition|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-02-866072-2|edition=e-book|authorlink=Peter Simons (academic)|editor=Borchert, Donald M|page=292|chapter=Leśniewski, Stanisław}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{anchor|both use and mention}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] told that in his student years, "quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions". He presented a class of sentences like
{{quote|Quine said that "quotation has a certain anomalous feature."}}
which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to [[W. V. Quine]], to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of [[proper name|naming]] it or [[definite description|describing]] its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00126690| issn = 0040-5833| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| last = Davidson| first = Donald| title = Quotation| journal = Theory and Decision| accessdate = 8 December 2010| date = March 1979| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v234l47038554624/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]] statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical [[paradox]]es, such as [[Quine's paradox]]. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] ([[diagonal lemma]]). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who makes the distinction thus:

{{quote|When a word is used to ''refer'' to something, it is said to be being ''used''. When a word is ''quoted'', though, so that someone is examining it for its surface aspects (typographical, phonetic, etc.), it is said to be being ''mentioned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metamagical Themas |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |year=1985 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic, Logic, and Logic |last=Boolos |first=George |authorlink=George Boolos |year=1999 |page=398 |quote=In this 1995 paper, Boolos discussed ambiguities in using quotation marks as part of a [[formal language]], and proposed a way of distinguishing levels of mentioning using a finite number of marks, using "′" to modify the succeeding "°", as in:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. Quine]],&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;Whose views on quotation are fine,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;°Boston° names Boston,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;and ′°°Boston°′° names °Boston°, &lt;!-- sic; for more explanation, you must read the paper --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;But 9 doesn't designate 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction "may seem rather pedantic".&lt;ref name="Devitt99" /&gt;

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher [[John Searle]], [[Jacques Derrida]] mentioned the distinction as "rather laborious and problematical".&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Derrida |year=1977 |p=79 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
