'''Aerial survey''' is a method of collecting [[geomatics]] or other [[image]]ry by using [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s, [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s or other aerial methods. Typical types of data collected include [[aerial photography]], [[Lidar]], [[remote sensing]]  (using various visible and invisible bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[infrared]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[ultraviolet]]) and also geophysical data (such as [[aeromagnetic survey]]s and [[gravity]]. It can also refer to the chart or map made by analysing a region from the air. Aerial survey should be distinguished from [[satellite imagery]] technologies because of its better resolution, quality and [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] conditions (which can negatively impact and obscure [[Earth observation satellite|satellite observation]]). Today, aerial survey is sometimes recognized as a synonym for aerophotogrammetry, part of [[photogrammetry]] where the [[camera]] is placed in the air. Measurements on aerial images are provided by [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] technologies and methods.&lt;ref&gt;A. Sechin. Digital Photogrammetric Systems: Trends and Developments. GeoInformatics. #4, 2014, pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerial surveys can provide information on many things not visible from the ground.

==Terms used in aerial survey==

;exposure station or air station: the position of the [[Cardinal point (optics)#Principal planes and points|optical centre]] of the camera at the moment of exposure.
;flying height:  the elevation of the exposure station above the datum (usually mean [[sea level]]).
;[[altitude]]: the vertical distance of the aircraft above the [[Earth]]'s surface.
;tilt: the angle between the aerial camera and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the [[Steady flight|line of flight]].
;tip: the angle between the aerial camera and the line of flight.
;principal point:  the point of intersection of the optical axis of the aerial camera with the [[Picture plane|photographical plane]].
;isocentre:  the point on the aerial photograph in which the bisector of the angle of tilt meets the photograph.
;[[nadir]] point: the image of the nadir, i.e. the point on the aerial photograph where a [[Plumb bob|plumbline]] dropped from the front nodal point pierces the photograph.
;scale: ratio of the [[focal length]] of the camera objective and the distance of the exposure station from the ground.
;[[azimuth]]: the clockwise horizontal angle measured about the ground [[nadir]] point from the ground survey [[North]] meridian in the plane of photograph.

==Uses==
Aerial surveys are used for:

Aerial surveys use a measuring camera where the elements of its interior orientation are known, but with much larger [[focal length]] and [[Photographic film|film]] and specialized [[Camera lens|lens]]es.

==Aerial survey sensors==
In order to carry out an aerial survey, a sensor needs to be fixed to the interior or the exterior of the airborne platform with line-of-sight to the target it is [[Remote sensing|remotely sensing]]. With manned [[aircraft]], this is accomplished either through an aperture in the [[Skin (aeronautics)|skin]] of the aircraft or mounted externally on a wing [[strut]]. With [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs), the sensor is typically mounted under or inside.

Aerial survey systems are typically operated with the following:
* Flight navigation software, which directs the pilot to fly in the desired pattern for the survey.
* [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], a combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) to provide position and orientation information for the data recorded.
* [[Gyro-stabilized camera systems|Gyro-stabilized]] mount to counter the effects of aircraft roll, pitch and yaw.
* Data storage unit to save the data that is recorded.

==Examples of aerial survey sensors==
* Vexcel UltraCam Eagle
* [[Leica Camera|Leica]] ADS100
* WaldoAir XCAM
* RIEGL LMS-Q780
* [[Trimble (company)Trimble]] AX80

'''Antichthones''', in [[geography]], are those peoples who inhabit the [[antipodes]], regions on opposite sides of the [[Earth]]. The word is compounded of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ὰντὶ'' ("opposed") and ''χθών'' ("earth").

[[Image:Climatic zones and antipodes.png|180px|right]]
[[Classical Europe|Classical]] and [[Medieval Europe]] considered the Earth to be divided by the [[equator]] into two [[Sphere|hemispheres]], the northern and southern; those who inhabited one of these hemispheres were said to be antichthones to those of the other. This idea was expounded by [[Pomponius Mela|Mela]] and other Classical authors, though Christian writers, who believed that all people on earth must be descended from Adam, denied the possibility that any southern land, if it existed, could be inhabited by humans. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], arguing from a position of scriptural [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], wrote in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' "it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man."&lt;ref name="CITYO'GOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dods |first1=Marcus (translator) |authorlink1=Philip Schaff |last2=St. Augustine |authorlink2=Augustine of Hippo |title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine |chapter=Book XVI, Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes. |volume=2 |editor1=Philip Schaff |work=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |year=1890 |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702022213/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archivedate=July 2, 2003 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Borden Base Line Plaque, South Deerfield MA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque at the Tilton Library in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts|South Deerfield]]]]

The '''Borden Base Line''' is a historic  survey line (7.42 miles, {{convert|39009.73|ft|m}} long) running north/south through [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]] and [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. It was completed in 1831, and is now on the [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks]].

The base line measurement was the first project of its kind undertaken in America, and essential for Massachusetts' pioneering Trigonometrical Survey, performed under chief engineer Robert Treat Paine. Its careful measurement was critical, since the accuracy of the whole triangulation network depended on it.

The base line was measured with greater accuracy than previously possible by using a new measuring device invented by [[Simeon Borden]], which employed a bi-metallic measuring instrument to provide constant readings despite temperature variations. His apparatus was {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, enclosed in a tube, and employed with four compound microscopes.

Borden was a highly competent engineer whose ability was widely recognized. Indeed, the entire project became generally known as the Borden Survey. He measured the base line with a nominal accuracy of better than one part in 5 million. As Professor A. D. Butterfield has written, "The work performed and results obtained far surpassed in magnitude and attainment of any previous work of this kind in America."

It appears that the north end of the baseline lies just south of the intersection of today's Route 116 and Route 5 in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts]]. According to the Valley Historians, the south end is still marked by a copper plug set into a boulder, located in the back yard of the house at 30 Bridge Street, [[Hatfield, Massachusetts]].

'''Brunton, Inc.''' ® is a manufacturer of technical outdoor gear located in [[Riverton, Wyoming]].  Brunton is well known for innovation in the categories of recreational [[compass]]es, navigational equipment, and survey instruments.

==History==
David W. Brunton, a Canadian-born geologist and mining engineer, and William Aimsworth, a skilled watch repairman, founded Brunton in 1895. The firm is most famous for its earliest product, the [[Brunton compass|Brunton Pocket Transit]]®. [[Geologist]]s, foresters, surveyors, and [[archaeologist]]s&lt;ref name="WIL"&gt;Willoughby, Tim, ''[http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20100808/ASPENWEEKLY/100809925 David W. Brunton and his compass]'', Aspen Times, retrieved 25 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  use this handheld compass and clinometer. Often simply called a "Brunton", the ''Pocket Transit'' was first patented in 1894 by David Brunton, who commissioned William Ainsworth &amp; Sons to manufacture his invention in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kooters.com/sezbrntn.html |title= Tips for selecting a Brunton pocket transit |accessdate= 2010-10-03 |work=  |publisher= Kooter's Geology Tools |date= 2009-10-06 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427034455/http://www.kooters.com/sezbrntn.html |archivedate= 2010-04-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The company later incorporated as William Ainsworth Inc. and for many years produced the ''Pocket Transit'' along with surveying transits, theodolites, and other instruments.

By 1965, William Ainsworth Inc. was owned by a series of corporate conglomerates, and product quality varied as the company changed hands repeatedly.  In 1972, a group of businessmen from Riverton, Wyoming bought the company and formed Brunton, Inc.  In Riverton, Brunton began producing a new series of recreational outdoor compasses, hunting knives, and binoculars in addition to the ''Brunton Pocket Transit''.

In 1996, the company was acquired by [[Silva compass|Silva of Sweden AB]], the original Swedish-based manufacturer of the ''Silva'' brand compass.  Initially, Brunton sold Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices imported from Sweden under the ''Elite'' ''Pro Elite'', ''Nexus'', and ''MNS'' labels (Johnson Outdoors retained the exclusive rights to the ''Silva'' ® brand name in North America).  Brunton began sourcing some of its compass models from Asia.&lt;ref name="SCH"&gt;Scheer, Joshua, ''[http://dailyranger.com/story.php?story_id=706&amp;headline=Expansion-at-Brunton-promises-50-new-jobs Expansion at Brunton Promises 50 New Jobs]'', The Ranger, 15 March 2012, retrieved 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"&gt;Over, Ernie, ''[http://county10.com/2012/03/14/a-360-turnaround-bruntons-compass-manufacturing-relocated-to-riverton-from-china/ A 180° turnaround: Brunton’s Compass manufacturing relocated to Riverton from China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615084413/http://county10.com/2012/03/14/a-360-turnaround-bruntons-compass-manufacturing-relocated-to-riverton-from-china/# |date=2012-06-15 }}'', County 10 News Desk, County10.com, 14 March 2012, retrieved 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Silva Group was acquired by the Finnish [[Fiskars Corporation]],&lt;ref name="ALL"&gt;Allonen, Heikki, ''Fiskars Acquires Swedish Silva Group'', Stock Exchange Press Release, Fiskars Corporation, 30 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.  Along with the rest of  the Silva Group, Brunton became part of the Outdoor division of Fiskars. As of 2009, Brunton, Inc. employed about 40 people.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://flashlightnews.org/story2763.shtml Fiskars to Sell Brunton to Fenix Outdoor]'', FlashlighNews.org, retrieved 25 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Fiskars announced the sale of Brunton Inc. to Fenix Outdoor AB, a Swedish company.&lt;ref&gt;''Fiskars Sells US Camping Equipment Business to Fenix Outdoor'', Nordic Business Report, 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of Fiskars divestment of Brunton Inc., Silva of Sweden AB ceased all exports of its Swedish-made compasses and GPS devices to North America, including the ''Nexus'', ''Elite'', and ''Pro Elite'' lines. In turn, Brunton ceased export of its model 8020, 8040, and 9020 compasses to Silva of Sweden AB. 

As of March 2012, the company employed around 68 people at its Riverton, Wyoming manufacturing facility.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;

==Product Range==
===Compasses===
As William Ainsworth Inc., production of the ''Pocket Transit™'' continued''.'' The ''Pocket Transit'' remains in production today, and is offered in numerous versions and configurations. In 1970, the company introduced the ''Brunton Cadet'', a simplified evolution of the Pocket Transit incorporating a compass and clinometer, intended for use in training students in the fields of geology, forestry, mining, and surveying.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;''Boys' Life: Gifts &amp; Gimmicks'', Vol. 60 No. 6 (June 1970), ''[[Boys' Life]]'', Boy Scouts of America, ISSN 0006-8608, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The company soon began marketing the ''Cadet'' to instruct Boy Scouts in the principles of surveying.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;  
[[Image:Kompass Silva.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A Brunton 9020G/Silva ''Voyager'' compass]]
In 1972, the newly formed Brunton, Inc. began compass and transit production in Riverton, Wyoming.  Compasses included the ''Pocket Transit'', ''Cadet'', and an emergency compass called the ''Life Card'', designed to float in a bowl of water. This was followed in 1981 by the Model 8040 ''Sportsman's Compass''™, a map (baseplate) compass with folding cover and mirror sight&lt;ref&gt;''Equip &amp; Go'', Backpacker Magazine, Vol. 9 No. 2 (April–May 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year, Brunton introduced the Model 9020. This small baseplate compass was designed for hikers, outdoorsmen, and hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Darga, Bert, ''The Survival Bible'', New York, NY:  Bobbs-Merrill (Stonesong Press), {{ISBN|0672527073}}, 9780672527074 (1982), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next ten years, Brunton would introduce a full range of map or baseplate compasses based on a liquid-filled vial with ''no-tools adjustment'' for magnetic declination.  This new line included Models ''8010'', ''8020'', ''8040'', ''9020'', and the compact 9030 ''Trailbuster''.  Brunton baseplate compasses with a '''G'''  suffix (i.e. ''9020G)'' featured bright yellow-green acrylic baseplates. Brunton often included UTM and map scales for U.S. standard 1:24,000 and 1:62,500 USGS topographic maps. The ''Model 9030 Trailbuster''™, intended to replicate the popular 1960s-era Taylor ''Model 2912'' field compass, omitted the baseplate in order to minimize space and weight.

In 1991, the U.S. military purchased a number of Brunton Model ''8010'' ''Smoke Chaser''™  compasses originally produced for [[U.S. Forest Service]] fire-fighting crews.  These were stocked in survival kits for U.S. Navy and Marine flight crews. These Model 8010 compasses used clear baseplates and were equipped with lanyards.  The compasses were shipped in plain cardboard boxes with military stock number NSN 6605-00-553-8795.  Brunton discontinued all 8000- and 9000- series compasses in 2011.

After being aquired by Silva, Brunton began selling Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices. The Nexus line included the Silva Model 15T and Model 25 ''Ranger'' compasses, rebranded as the Nexus 15TDC and 25TDC Pro Elite. Brunton also began importing some compass models from Taiwan and mainland China, including the ''Model 9030'' and ''Models 9075'' and ''9077'' lensatic compasses. Silva of Sweden also sold some Brunton models under the Silva ''Voyager''™ name.

In 1998, Brunton introduced its ''Eclipse™'' range of liquid-filled baseplate compasses featuring low-profile vials, a magnified readout in 1-degree increments, and a patented ''circle-over-circle'' magnetized disk in place of a traditional pointed needle.&lt;ref&gt;''HAND-HELD NEEDLELESS COMPASS'', U.S. Patent No. 6282802 Filed 14 August 1998, Issued 4 September 2001, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Patent Office&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Eclipse'' compasses included the ''Model 8096 GPS'', the ''Model 8097'', and the ''Model 8099 Pro''.  Like older Brunton outdoor compasses, the ''Eclipse'' series used ''no-tools'' adjustable declination.  Designed by Brunton, but imported from China,&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt; some owners of ''Eclipse'' compasses reported issues with air bubbles forming in the compass vials.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/Archive/Eclipse_769.html Eclipse: Rock Climbing Gear]'', retrieved 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Brunton introduced an electronic fluxgate compass called the ''Brunton Outback''™. Imported from Taiwan, the ''Outback'' featured gimbal-mounted magnetic sensors which allowed the unit to be tilted up to 15 degrees while producing accurate readings.  The ''Outback'' stored up to 10 bearings in its memory. A night navigation mode warned if the user was moving off-track with illuminated arrows. The ''Outback'' was eventually replaced by the Brunton ''Nomad''™ electronic compass.  After complaints about calibration and inaccurate bearings, the ''Nomad'' was  discontinued in 2011. 
     
In 2009, Brunton stopped selling most Silva of Sweden products.  The ''Nexus'' and ''Elite'' lines were discontinued, as well as the ''Brunton 54LU'' (''Silva Model 54).'' The ''Brunton 54LU'' was marketed to foresters, surveyors, geologists, and SAR teams before being discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;''Brunton Discontinuing The Best Compass Ever (Brunton 54LU)'', Extreme Tolerance.Com, 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sierratradingpost.com/brunton-54lu-baseplate-map-compass-mirrored-sighting~p~2535h/reviews/15780082~outstanding-compass/ Outstanding Compass!]'', SierraTradingPost.com, 15 December 2010, retrieved 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Silva models, including the ''Brunton 15TDCL'' and ''Brunton 16DLU'', were later sourced from a production facility in China. In 2011, Brunton discontinued the Models 8010G, 8020, 8040G, 9020G, and 9030 compasses.

In 2012, Brunton introduced a new series of outdoor compasses called ''O.S.S.''™ (''Orbital Sighting System)''.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;  Like the ''Eclipse'' series, the O.S.S.™ compasses featured a large liquid-filled capsule and ''circle-over-circle'' north indicator. In addition, several design improvements set the ''O.S.S.''™ apart. These included a deep-well 'global' vial, a serrated outer bezel, a needle with an orienting circle instead of a magnetized disc, and map meridian lines imprinted in the base of the housing.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;  Unlike older ''Eclipse'' compasses, ''O.S.S.'' compasses were assembled in Riverton, Wyoming from components made in the United States.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;  As of 2012, Brunton is the only major compass manufacturer with U.S.-based production facilities.&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;

In 2014, Brunton dropped the circle-over-circle magnetized disk/needle design used in the ''Eclipse'' and ''O.S.S.'' series. Their current line of baseplate compasses, the TruArc™ series uses rare-earth magnets to stabilize the north indicator (needle), These compasses are designed to work in all magnetic zones. 

===GPS===
In 2000, Silva of Sweden AB introduced its Silva ''Multi-Navigator'' GPS device. Brunton marketed the product in North America as the Brunton ''MNS''™. The ''MNS'' featured an electronic compass, barometer, and barometric altimeter in addition to GPS functionality. With a relatively high energy consumption of 210 mA (or 270 mA with illumination on), the ''MNS'' had a battery life of around 10 hours. At $399, the ''Brunton MNS'' faced intense competition competitors such as ''Garmin'' and ''Magellan.'' Products with better battery life and improved scrolling menu displays kep the ''MNS'' from gaining significant market share. Furthermore, the ''MNS'' was not [[WAAS]] capable and did not offer internal storage of waypoints, routes or tracks. In 2004, Silva and Brunton introduced a slightly lower-priced, WAAS-capable GPS receiver called the ''Atlas''™.  This product also failed to gain a significant share of the handheld GPS market, and the Brunton ''MNS'' and ''Atlas'' were both discontinued by Brunton in 2009.

===Optics===
In 1992, Brunton introduced a line of binoculars and other optical equipment aimed at the hunting and outdoor recreation market. The optics line was discontinued in 2014.

A '''cave survey''' is a [[map]] of all or part of a [[cave]] system, which may be produced to meet differing standards of accuracy depending on the cave conditions and equipment available underground. Cave surveying and [[cartography]], i.e. the creation of an accurate, detailed map, is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave and is a fundamental part of [[speleology]]. Surveys can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on [[speleogenesis]], provide a spatial reference for other areas of scientific study and assist visitors with route-finding.

Traditionally, cave surveys are produced in two-dimensional form due to the confines of print, but given the three-dimensional environment inside a cave, modern techniques using [[computer aided design]] are increasingly used to allow a more realistic representation of a cave system.

==History==
[[File:Marble Arch Survey (Brodrick, H., 1908).png|thumb|right|1908 survey of [[Marble Arch Caves]] by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club|alt=Hand-drawn map of a cave, showing meandering underground river passage as well as surface topography including large shakeholes.]]
The first known plan of a cave dates from 1546, and was of a man-made cavern in tufa called the Stufe di Nerone (Nero's Oven) in [[Pozzuoli]] near [[Naples]] in Italy. The first natural cave to be mapped was the [[Baumann's Cave|Baumannshöhle]] in [[Germany]], of which a sketch from 1656 survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science |last= Gunn |first=J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn= 978-1-57958-399-6|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early survey dates from before 1680, and was made by [[John Aubrey]] of Long Hole in the [[Cheddar Gorge]]. It consists of an elevational section of the cave. Numerous other surveys of caves were made in the following years, though most are sketches and are limited in accuracy. The first cave that is likely to have been accurately surveyed with instruments is the [[Grotte de Miremont]] in [[France]]. This was surveyed by a civil engineer in 1765 and includes numerous cross-sections. [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] was the first person to describe surveying techniques. His surveys were made by having an assistant walk down the passage until they were almost out of sight. Martel would then take a compass bearing to the assistant's light, and measure the distance by pacing up to the assistant. This would equate to a modern-day BCRA Grade 2 survey.

The first cave to have its centreline calculated by a computer is the Fergus River Cave in [[Ireland]], which was plotted by members of the [[UBSS]] in 1964. The software was programmed onto a large university mainframe computer and a paper plot was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nicholson |first1= F.H.|last2=Patmore |first2=D.J. |year= 1965 |title= The Fergus RIver Cave, Co. Clare, Ireland |journal= UBSS Proceedings |volume= 10|issue= 3|page= 285|publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
There are many variations to [[surveying]] methodology, but most are based on a similar set of steps which haven't changed fundamentally in 250 years, although the instruments (compass and tape) have got smaller and more accurate. Since the late 1990s digital instruments such as [[distometers]] have started to change the process, leading to the advent of fully paperless surveying around 2007. The main variation on the normal methodology detailed below have been devices such as LIDAR and SONAR surveyors that produce a point cloud rather than a series of linked stations. Video-based surveying also exists in prototype form.

=== Surveying ===
A survey team begins at a fixed point (such as the cave entrance) and measures a series of consecutive [[sightline|line-of-sight]] measurements between stations. The stations are temporary fixed locations chosen chiefly for their ease of access and clear sight along the cave passage. In some cases, survey stations may be permanently marked to create a fixed reference point to which to return at a later date.

The measurements taken between the stations include:
* direction ([[azimuth]] or [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]) taken with a [[compass]]
* inclination from horizontal (dip) taken with a [[clinometer]]
* distance measured with a low-stretch tape or [[laser rangefinder]]
* optionally, distance to surrounding walls&amp;nbsp;– left, right, up, down (''LRUD'')

Coincident with recording straight-line data, details of passage dimensions, shape, gradual or sudden changes in elevation, the presence or absence of still or flowing water, the location of notable features and the material on the floor are recorded, often by means of a sketch map.

=== Drawing a line-plot ===
Later, the [[cartographer]] analyses the recorded data, converting them into two-dimensional measurements by way of [[geometry|geometrical]] calculations. From them he/she creates a ''line-plot''; a scaled geometrical representation of the path through the cave.

=== Finalising ===
The cartographer then draws details around the line-plot, using the additional data of passage dimensions, water flow and floor/wall [[topography]] recorded at the time, to produce a completed cave survey. Cave surveys drawn on paper are often presented in two-dimensional ''plan'' and/or ''profile'' views, while computer surveys may simulate three dimensions. Although primarily designed to be functional, some [[caver]]s consider cave surveys as an art form.{{Who|date=December 2011}}

== Hydrolevelling ==
Hydrolevelling is an alternative to measuring depth with clinometer and tape that has a long history of use in Russia.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Degtjarev |first1=Alexander  |last2=Snetkov |first2=Eugene |last3=Gurjanov |first3=Alexey |title=Obtaining accurate cave depths by hydrolevelling |journal=Compass Points |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association|BCRA]] Cave Survey Group |issue=38 |date=July 2007 |pages=8–12 |url=http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP38/CP38.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1361-8962 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is regularly used in building construction for finding two points with the same height, as in levelling a floor. In the simplest case, a tube with both ends open is used, attached to a strip of wood, and the tube is filled with water and the depth at each end marked. In Russia, measuring the depth of caves by hydrolevelling began in the 1970s, and was considered to be the most accurate means of measuring depth despite the difficulties in using the cumbersome equipment of the time. Interest in the method has been revived following the discovery of [[Voronya Cave|Voronja]] on the [[Arabica Massif]] in the [[Caucasus]]&amp;nbsp;– currently the world's deepest cave.

The hydrolevel device used in recent Voronja expeditions comprises a {{convert|50|m|ft|sing=on}} transparent tube filled with water, which is coiled or placed on a reel. A rubber glove which acts as a reservoir is placed on one end of the tube, and a metal box with a transparent window is placed on the other. A diver's digital wristwatch with a depth gauge function is submerged in the box. If the rubber glove is placed on one station and the box with the depth gauge is placed on a lower one, then the hydrostatic pressure between the two points depends only on the difference in heights and the density of the water, i.e. the route of the tube does not affect the pressure in the box. Reading the depth gauge gives the apparent depth change between the higher and lower station. Depth changes are 'apparent' because depth gauges are calibrated for sea water, and the hydrolevel is filled with fresh water. Therefore, a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes. Adding the readings for consecutive pairs of stations gives the total depth of the cave.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro /&gt;

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy, or ''grade'', of a cave survey is dependent on the methodology of measurement. A common survey grading system is that created by the [[British Cave Research Association]] in the 1960s, which uses a scale of six grades.&lt;ref name=BCRA-grades&gt;{{cite web |title=BCRA Surveying Grades |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association]] |url=http://www.bcra.org.uk/surveying/ |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BCRA grading system ===

==== BCRA gradings for a cave line survey ====
; Grade 1
: Sketch of low accuracy where no measurements have been made
; Grade 2 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
: May be used, if necessary, to describe a sketch that is intermediate in accuracy between Grade 1 &amp; 3
; Grade 3
:A rough magnetic survey. Horizontal &amp; vertical angles measured to ±2.5&amp;nbsp;°; distances measured to ±50&amp;nbsp;cm; station position error less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 4 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
:May be used, if necessary, to describe a survey that fails to attain all the requirements of Grade 5 but is more accurate than a Grade 3 survey.
;Grade 5
:A Magnetic survey. Horizontal and vertical angles measured to ±1&amp;nbsp;°; distances should be observed and recorded to the nearest centimetre and station positions identified to less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 6
:A magnetic survey that is more accurate than grade 5, (see note 5).
;Grade X
:A survey that is based primarily on the use of a theodolite or total station instead of a compass, (see notes 6 and 10 below).

===== Notes =====
# The above table is a summary, omitting some technical details and definitions; the definitions of the survey grades given above must be read in conjunction with these notes.
# In all cases it is necessary to follow the spirit of the definition and not just the letter.
# To attain Grade 3 it is necessary to use a clinometer in passages having appreciable slope.
# To attain Grade 5 it is essential for instruments to be properly calibrated, and all measurements must be taken from a point within a 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter sphere centred on the survey station.
# A Grade 6 survey requires the compass to be used at the limit of possible accuracy, i.e. accurate to ±0.5&amp;nbsp;°; clinometer readings must be to the same accuracy. Station position error must be less than ±2.5&amp;nbsp;cm, which will require the use of tripods at all stations or other fixed station markers ('roofhooks').
# A Grade X survey must include on the drawing notes descriptions of the instruments and techniques used, together with an estimate of the probable accuracy of the survey compared with Grade 3, 5 or 6 surveys.
# Grades 2 and 4 are for use only when, at some stage of the survey, physical conditions have prevented the survey from attaining all the requirements for the next higher grade and it is not practical to re-survey.
# Caving organisations, etc., are encouraged to reproduce Table 1 and Table 2 in their own publications; permission is not required from BCRA to do so, but the tables must not be reprinted without these notes.
# Grade X is only potentially more accurate than Grade 6. It should never be forgotten that the theodolite/Total Station is a complex precision instrument that requires considerable training and regular practice if serious errors are not to be made through its use!
# In drawing up, the survey co-ordinates must be calculated and not hand-drawn with scale rule and protractor to obtain Grade 5.

==== BCRA gradings for recording cave passage detail ====
;Class A
:All passage details based on memory.
;Class B
:Passage details estimated and recorded in the cave.
;Class C
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations only.
;Class D
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations and wherever else needed to show significant changes in passage dimensions.

===== Notes =====
# The accuracy of the detail should be similar to the accuracy of the line.
# Normally only one of the following combinations of survey grades should be used: 
#* 1A
#* 3B or 3C
#* 5C or 5D
#* 6D 
#* XA, XB, XC or XD

=== Survey error detection ===
The equipment used to undertake a cave survey continues to improve. The use of computers, inertia systems, and electronic distance finders has been proposed, but few practical underground applications have evolved at present.

Despite these advances, faulty instruments, imprecise measurements, recording errors or other factors may still result in an inaccurate survey, and these errors are often difficult to detect. Some cave surveyors measure each station twice, recording a ''back-sight'' to the previous station in the opposite direction. A back-sight compass reading that is different by 180&amp;nbsp;degrees and a clinometer reading that is the same value but with the reverse direction (positive rather than negative, for example) indicates that the original measurement was accurate.

When a loop within a cave is surveyed back to its starting point, the resulting line-plot should also form a closed loop. Any gap between the first and last stations is called a ''loop-closure error''. If no single error is apparent, one may assume the loop-closure error is due to cumulative inaccuracies, and cave survey software can 'close the loop' by averaging possible errors throughout the loop stations. Loops to test survey accuracy may also be made by surveying across the surface between multiple entrances to the same cave.

The use of a low-frequency cave radio can also verify survey accuracy. A receiving unit on the surface can pinpoint the depth and location of a transmitter in a cave passage by measurement of the geometry of its radio waves. A survey over the surface from the receiver back to the cave entrance forms an artificial loop with the underground survey, whose loop-closure error can then be determined.

In the past, cavers were reluctant to redraw complex cave maps after detecting survey errors. Today, computer cartography can automatically redraw cave maps after data has been corrected.

== Surveying software ==
There are a large number of surveying packages available on various computer platforms, most of which have been developed by cavers with a basis in computer programming. Many of the packages perform particularly well for specific tasks, and as such many cave surveyors will not solely choose one product over another for all cartographic tasks.

A popular program for producing a centerline survey is [[Survex]], which was originally developed by members of the Cambridge University Caving Club for processing survey data from club expeditions to Austria. It was released to the public in 1992. The centerline data can then be exported in various formats and the cave detail drawn in with various other programmes such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Inkscape]]. Other programmes such as 'Tunnel' and [[Therion (software)|Therion]] have full centerline and map editing capabilities. Therion notably, when it closes survey loops, warps the passages to fit over their length, meaning that entire passages  do not have to be redrawn.

Terrestrial LiDAR units are increasing significantly in accuracy and decreasing in price.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Several Caves have been "scanned" using both "time of flight" and "phase shift" LiDAR units.  The differences are in the relative accuracies available to each.  The Oregon Caves National Park, was LiDAR scanned in August 2011, as were the Paisley Caves Archaeological dig sigte in SE Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Both were scanned with a FARO Focus Phase shift scanner with +/-2mm accuracy.  The Oregon Caves were scanned from the main public entrance to the 110 exit and were loop surveyed to the point of beginning.  The data is not yet available for public use, but copies are retained by both the US Park Service and i-TEN Associates in Portland, Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Automated methods==
In recent years an underground geographic positioning technology called [[HORTA (mining)|HORTA]] has been utilized in the [[mining]] industry.  The technology utilizes a [[gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]] to aid in [[three-dimensional|3D]]-position determination.&lt;ref name=cmj2000&gt;
[http://www.canadianminingjournal.com/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000110318&amp;type=Print%20Archives Inco's Innovations], ''Canadian Mining Journal'', April 2000, accessed 2010-12-02. ''"HORTA unit for determining the geographic position underground. HORTA-Honeywell Ore Retrieval and Tunneling Aid-is a box containing a gyro and an accelerometer, originally developed for the U.S. military, that solves the problem of positioning and location underground."&lt;/ref&gt;

Such automated methods have provided a more than fifty-fold increase in underground surveying productivity with more accurate and finer detail maps as well.&lt;ref name=cmj2000/&gt;

[[File:CURAwordmark.jpeg|thumb|Center for Urban and Regional Analysis logo.]]
'''Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA)''' 
The Center for Urban &amp; Regional Analysis (CURA) is an interdisciplinary research organization of [[The Ohio State University]]. CURA's mission is to serve as a bridge across academia, industry, and the policy sector by providing spatial analysis of economic, social, environmental, and health issues in urban and regional settings in Ohio and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization explores various social, political, economic, geographic, economic, and public health issues using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other spatial analysis techniques.  CURA also offers a speaker series which brings a wide range of speakers to campus each semester. 
== History ==
[[File:View of Derby Hall, on the Oval at Ohio State..png|thumb|222x222px|CURA is located in Derby Hall, on the Oval at Ohio State.]]
The movement for an urban center began in 1995 with a recommendation from the Committee on Applied Social and Public Policy.  Funding followed three years later in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1345/osu-one-step-closer-to-cura-1.100131#.Ud7RYvmcex0 The Lantern: "OSU One Step Closer to CURA" by Miranda Zink]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CURA then was formed at The Ohio State University in 1999 as the Urban and Regional Analysis Initiative (URAI).  Two years later, in April 2001, the organization officially renamed itself the Center for Urban &amp; Regional Analysis and was given final approval by the Board of Trustees.  The change was announced in the University's newspaper, The Lantern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cura.osu.edu/about-cura/history{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "The Formation of CURA" http://cura.osu.edu/about-cura/history{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization was projected to receive $240,000 per year in funding from the state of Ohio along with an additional $150,000 from the Office of Academic Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1345/osu-one-step-closer-to-cura-1.100131#.Ud7RYvmcex0 The Lantern: "OSU One Step Closer to CURA" by Miranda Zink]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

CURA has conducted extensive research and analysis on various topics such as air traffic, urban growth, land use, food accessibility, crime, housing, and data mapping through [[GIS]] technology.  It is one of just eight Ohio Urban University Program (UUP) research institutes.  The center provides a place for researchers from many fields to collaborate on critical urban issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Ohio State University College of Arts and Sciences: "Center for Urban and Regional Analysis Snapshot"[http://artsandsciences.osu.edu/cura_snapshot]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partners ===
The Center for Urban and Regional Analysis is closely associated with Ohio State's Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture and the Geography Department but collaborates with a wide range of departments and centers at Ohio State including:&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Kirwan Institute
*The Food Innovation Center
*The Center for Aviation Studies
*[[Chadwick Arboretum]] and Learning Gardens
*Ohio State Facilities Operations and Development

== Projects ==

=== Data Hosting ===

In June 2013, CURA, in collaboration with the [[Chadwick Arboretum]] and Learning Gardens, completed a web-based Tree Tour of Ohio State's historic Oval.  The Story Map, hosted on [[ArcGIS]].com, provides the user with a guided walking tour of 32 significant and historic trees along with information about each tree's environmental and financial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Energy and Environment: "CURA Creates Oval Digital Tree Tour" [http://oee.osu.edu/cura-creates-oval-digital-tree-tour.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartography ===
In partnership with the Kirwan Institute of Ohio State, CURA is working to digitize Ohio's redlining maps from the 1930s.

=== Spatial Analysis ===
Ohio State's Food Innovation Center and the Mid-Ohio Foodbank are working with CURA and using GIS to find ways to increase the equity of fresh food distribution.

=== Data Visualization ===
CURA partnered with Center for Aviation Studies at OSU to create maps displaying the accessibility of domestic air service in the United States.  The maps show data for over 400 airports with an index describing the level of air service of a given region.  The project requires the continued input of data to show how the accessibility of given airports changes over time.  Graduate Affiliate Kejing Peng created a detailed web application displaying the results of the air traffic analysis.  The T100 Airport Traffic Analysis is both interactive and informative to users, providing a great deal of information on individual airports across the country.

With Ohio State's Facilities Operations and Development, CURA Graduate Associate Shaun Fontanella is planning to develop digital signs for central buildings on campus.  The signs will display and track energy consumption of each building in order to encourage decreased consumption.&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This work was subsequently pursued by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], who relaxed the initial assumption that surfaces of equal density were spheroids.&lt;ref name=Todhunter&gt;{{cite book |author=Isaac Todhunter |title=A History of the Mathematical Theories of Attraction and the Figure of the Earth from the Time of Newton to that of Laplace |volume=Vol. 2 |publisher=Elibron Classics |isbn=1-4021-1717-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blZ_Tar9IRMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA500&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U0BK0IMg4DPZTFon_yf_DyT4wOlcQ#PPA62,M1 }} Reprint of the original edition of 1873 published by Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan (1968)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somigliana equation===
The above expression for ''g'' has been supplanted by the Somigliana equation (after [[Carlo Somigliana]]):

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi) = G_e \left[ \frac{1+k\sin^2 \varphi}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \sin^2 \varphi }} \right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A '''dodman''' (plural "'''dodmen'''") or a  '''hoddyman dod''' is a local English [[vernacular]] word for a [[land snail]]. The word is used in some of the [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] of [[England]]. This word is found in the [[Norfolk dialect]], according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Fairfax, in his ''Bulk and Selvedge'' (1674), speaks of “a snayl or dodman.”

'''Hodimadod''' is a similar word for snail that is more commonly used in the [[Buckinghamshire]] [[dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://met.open.ac.uk/genuki/big/eng/BKM/Vocabulary/vocabulary-H.html|title=H - Buckinghamshire Vocabulary|last=Cocks|first=Alfred Heneage|date=1897–1909|publisher=Genuki|accessdate=2010-09-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707131830/http://met.open.ac.uk/genuki/big/eng/BKM/Vocabulary/vocabulary-H.html|archivedate=2010-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively (and apparently now more commonly used in the Norfolk dialect) are the closely related words '''Dodderman '''or '''Doddiman'''. In everyday [[folklore]], these words are popularly said to be derived from the surname of a travelling cloth seller called Dudman, who supposedly had a bent back and carried a large roll of cloth on his back. The words to dodder, doddery, doddering, meaning to progress in an unsteady manner, are popularly said to have the same derivation.

A traditional Norfolk rhyme goes as follows:
::"Doddiman, doddiman, put out your horn,
::Here comes a thief to steal your corn."
Source: Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1894

The 'inventor' of [[ley lines]], [[Alfred Watkins]], thought that in the words "dodman" and the builder's "[[brick hod|hod]]" there was a survival of an ancient British term for a [[surveying|surveyor]].  Watkins felt that the name came about because the snail's two horns resembled a surveyor's two surveying rods.  Watkins also supported this idea with an etymology from 'doddering along' and 'dodge' (akin, in his mind, to the series of actions a surveyor would carry out in moving his rod back and forth until it accurately lined up with another one as a backsight or foresight) and the Welsh verb 'dodi' meaning to lay or place.  He thus decided that [[The Long Man of Wilmington]] was an image of an ancient surveyor.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070809012401/http://www.gothicimage.co.uk/books/leyhunter1.html]

The project has established 15 Indian reference stations, 3 Indian navigation land uplink stations, 3 Indian mission control centers, and installation of all associated software and communication links.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gagan-system-ready-for-operations/article5565700.ece&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to help pilots to navigate in the Indian airspace by an accuracy of 3 m. This will be helpful for landing aircraft in marginal weather and difficult approaches like [[Mangalore Airport (India)|Mangalore]] and [[Kushok Bakula Rimpochhe Airport|Leh]] airports.

==Implementation==
The {{INRConvert|7.74|b|0}} project was created in three phases through 2008 by the [[Airports Authority of India|Airport Authority of India]] with the help of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]'s (ISRO) technology and space support.&lt;ref name=Isro&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite Navigation – GAGAN|url=http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx#Satellite|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=ISRO website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to provide navigation system for all phases of flight over the Indian airspace and in the adjoining area. It is applicable to safety-to-life operations, and meets the performance requirements of international civil aviation regulatory bodies.

The space component  became  available after the launch of the GAGAN payload on the GSAT-8 communication satellite, which was successfully launched. This payload was also part of the GSAT-4 satellite that was lost when the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) failed during launch in April 2010. A final system acceptance test was conducted during June 2012 followed by system certification during July 2013.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

== Technology ==

To begin implementing a satellite-based augmentation system over the Indian airspace, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] ([[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]]) codes for L1 frequency and L5 frequency were obtained from the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States|U.S]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on November 2001 and March 2005.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org" /&gt; The system will use eight reference stations located in [[Delhi]], [[Guwahati]], [[Kolkata]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Bangalore]], [[Jammu]] and [[Port Blair]], and a master control center at [[Bangalore]]. US defense contractor [[Raytheon]] has stated they will bid to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3966 Raytheon to bid for geosynchronous augmented navigation system (GAGAN) Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology demonstration ==

A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of technology demonstration system (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept had been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Center (MCC) located near Bangalore. Preliminary system acceptance testing has been successfully completed in December 2010.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt; The [[ground segment]] for GAGAN, which has been put up by the Raytheon, has 15 reference stations scattered across the country. Two mission control centres, along with associated uplink stations, have been set up at Kundalahalli in Bangalore. One more control centre and uplink station are to come up at Delhi. As a part of the programme, a network of 18 total electron content (TEC) monitoring stations were installed at various locations in India to study and analyse the behaviour of the ionosphere over the Indian region.

GAGAN's TDS signal in space provides a three-metre accuracy as against the requirement of 7.6 metres. Flight inspection of GAGAN signal is being carried out at [[Kozhikode]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Nagpur]] and [[Bangalore]] airports and the results have been satisfactory so far.

=== Study of Ionosphere ===
One essential component of the GAGAN project is the study of the ionospheric behaviour over the Indian region. This has been specially taken up in view of the uncertain nature of the behaviour of the ionosphere in the region. The study will lead to the optimisation of the algorithms for the ionospheric corrections in the region.

To study the ionospheric behaviour more effectively over entire Indian airspace, Indian universities and R&amp;D labs, which are involved in the development of regional based ionotropic model for GAGAN, have suggested nine more TEC stations.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"/&gt;

== Technology Integration ==

GAGAN after its final operational phase completion, will be compatible with other SBAS systems such as the [[wide-area augmentation system]] (WAAS), the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) and the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) and will provide seamless air navigation service across regional boundaries. While the ground segment consists of eight reference stations and a master control center, which will have sub systems such as data communication network, [[SBAS]] correction and verification system, operations and maintenance system, performance monitoring display and payload simulator, Indian land uplinking stations will have dish antenna assembly. The space segment will consist of one geo-navigation transponder.

== Effective flight-management system ==

A flight-management system based on GAGAN will then be poised to save operators time and money by managing climb, descent and engine performance profiles. The FMS will improve the efficiency and flexibility by increasing the use of operator-preferred trajectories.
It will improve airport and airspace access in all weather conditions, and the ability to meet the environmental and obstacle clearance constraints. It will also enhance reliability and reduce delays by defining more precise terminal area procedures that feature parallel routes and environmentally optimised airspace corridors.

* GAGAN will increase safety by using a three-dimensional approach operation with course guidance to the runway, which will reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain i.e., an accident whereby an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, inadvertently flies into terrain, an obstacle, or water.
* GAGAN will also offer high position accuracies over a wide geographical area like the Indian airspace. These positions accuracies will be simultaneously available to 80 civilian and more than 200 non-civilian airports and airfields and will facilitate an increase in the number of airports to 500 as planned. These position accuracies can be further enhanced with ground-based, augmentation system.

== Developments ==

The first GAGAN transmitter was integrated into the [[GSAT-4]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite, and had a goal of being operational in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 ISRO, Raytheon complete tests for GAGAN satellite navigational system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205075702/http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 |date=5 December 2006 }} India Defense Website. 20 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.N.

In 2009, Raytheon had won an 82 million dollar contract. It was mainly dedicated to modernise Indian air navigation system.&lt;ref name="GovCon"/&gt; The vice president of Command &amp; Control Systems, Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Andy Zogg commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GAGAN will be the world's most advanced air navigation system and further reinforces India's leadership in the forefront of air navigation. GAGAN will greatly improve safety, reduce congestion and enhance communications to meet India's growing air traffic management needs&lt;ref name="GovCon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raytheon Wins $82M Air Navigation Contract From India|url=http://www.govconwire.com/2009/07/raytheon-wins-82m-air-navigation-contract-from-india/|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=GovCon Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[DRDO|Defence Research and Development Organisation]] received a "miniaturised version" of the device with all the features from [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) and [[global navigation satellite systems]] (GNSS). The module weighing just 17 gm, can be used in multiple platforms ranging from aircraft (e.g. winged or rotor-craft) to small boats, ships. Reportedly, it can also assist "survey applications". It is a cost-efficient device and can be of "tremendous" civilian use. The navigation output is composed of GPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS position, speed and time data. According to a statement released by the DRDO, G3oM is a state-of-the-art technology receiver, integrating Indian GAGAN as well as both global positioning system and GLONASS systems.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

According to Deccan chronicle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[G. Satheesh Reddy]], associate director of the city-based Research Centre Imarat, said the product is bringing about a quantum leap in the area of GNSS technology and has paved the way for highly miniaturised GNSS systems for the future.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 17-gm device to guide missiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905014057/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 |date=5 September 2012 }} Deccan Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30 December 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India provisionally certified the GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation (GAGAN) system to RNP0.1 (Required Navigation Performance, 0.1 Nautical Mile) service level. The certification enabled aircraft fitted with SBAS equipment to use GAGAN signal in space for navigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Jan03_2014 | title=GAGAN System Certified for RNP0.1 Operations | date=3 January 2014 | accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===

'''GSAT-8''' is an Indian geostationary satellites, which was successfully launched using [[Ariane 5]] on 21 May 2011 and is positioned in geosynchronous orbit at 55 degrees E longitude.

'''GSAT-10''' is envisaged to augment the growing need of Ku and C-band transponders and carries 12 Ku Band, 12 C Band and 12 Extended C Band transponders and a GAGAN payload. The spacecraft employs the standard I-3K structure with power handling capability of around 6&amp;nbsp;kW with a lift off mass of 3400&amp;nbsp;kg. GSAT-10 was successfully launched by [[Ariane 5]] on 29 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

'''GSAT-15''' carries 24 Ku band transponders with India coverage beam and a GAGAN payload. was successfully launched on 10 November 2015, 21:34:07 UTC, completing the constellation.

===Indian regional navigation satellite system===
{{main|Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System}}
The Indian government has stated that it intends to use the experience of creating the GAGAN system to enable the creation of an autonomous regional navigation system called the '''I'''ndian '''R'''egional '''N'''avigation '''S'''atellite '''S'''ystem [[IRNSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm SATNAV Industry Meet 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331145825/http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm |date=31 March 2007 }}. ISRO Space India Newsletter. April – September 2006 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRNSS-1
Indian regional navigational satellite system (IRNSS)-1, the first of the seven satellites of the [[IRNSS]] constellation, carries a navigation payload and a C-band ranging transponder. The spacecraft employs an optimised I-1K structure with a power handling capability of around 1660W and a lift off mass of 1425&amp;nbsp;kg, and is designed for a nominal mission life of 10 years. The first satellite of IRNSS constellation was launched onboard PSLV (C22) on 1 July 2012. While the full constellation was planned to be realised during 2014 time frame, launch of subsequent satellites got delayed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Currently all 7 satellites are in orbit but in 2017 it was announced that all three&amp;nbsp;[[rubidium]]&amp;nbsp;[[atomic clock]]s&amp;nbsp;on board&amp;nbsp;[[IRNSS-1A]]&amp;nbsp;had failed, mirroring similar failures in the&amp;nbsp;[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] constellation. The first failure occurred in July 2016, following which two other clocks also failed. This rendered the satellite somewhat redundant and required replacement. Although the satellite still performs other functions, the data is coarse, and thus cannot be used for accurate measurements.&amp;nbsp;ISRO plans to replace it with IRNSS-1H in July or August 2017.

Two more clocks in the navigational system had started showing signs of abnormality, thereby taking the total number of failed clocks to five.

As a precaution to extend the operational life of navigation satellite, ISRO is running only one rubidium atomic clock instead of two in the remaining six satellites.&amp;nbsp;Each satellite has three clocks, therefore a total of 27 clocks for all satellites in the system (including standby satellites). The clocks of both IRNSS and GALILEO were supplied by SpectraTime. ISRO replaced the atomic clocks in two standby NavIC satellites.&amp;nbsp;The setback comes at a time when IRNSS is yet to start commercial operations.

== Applications ==

Karnataka Forest Department has used GAGAN to build a new, accurate and publicly available satellite based database of its forestlands. This is a followup to the Supreme Court directive to states to update and put up their respective forest maps. The geospatial database of forestlands pilot has used data from the Cartosat-2 satellite. The maps are meant to rid authorities of ambiguities related to forest boundaries and give clarity to forest administrators, revenue officials as also the public, according to R.K. Srivastava, chief conservator of forests (headquarters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gagan-kicks-off-new-forest-database/article7118060.ece?w=city GAGAN kicks off new forest database]. The Hindu. Retrieved on 2015-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Indian manufactured missiles including the [[BrahMos]] will use GAGAN for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Desi-G3OM-Makes-BrahMos-Smarter/2014/07/09/article2320976.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garden design''' is the art and process of [[design]]ing and creating plans for layout and planting of [[garden]]s and [[landscape]]s. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional [[garden designer]]s have some training in [[horticulture]] and the principles of design. Garden designer, [[Rev David Coles]], further elaborated this definition at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] (2018, BBC1, Chelsea) by stating that good garden design, while being on the one hand a “serious discipline” should embody a “playful creative mindfulness”. He postulates that successful garden designs enable transcendence from a physical sensory experience to a mindful awareness of being interconnected with nature. 
Some are also [[landscape architect|landscape architects]], a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Amateur gardeners may also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study, serious study in [[Master gardener program|Master Gardener Programs]], or by joining [[Garden club|gardening clubs]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{-}}

==Elements==
Whether gardens are designed by a professional or an amateur, certain principles form the basis of effective garden design, resulting in the creation of gardens to meet the needs, goals, and desires of the users or owners of the gardens.

Elements of garden design include the layout of [[hardscape|hard landscape]], such as paths, walls, [[Water garden|water features]], sitting areas and decking; as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their [[horticultural]] requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, [[Habit (biology)|growth habit]], size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choice of plants in terms of speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether [[Annual plant|annual]] or [[Perennial plant|perennial]], and bloom-time, and many other characteristics.

Important considerations in the garden design include how the garden will be used, the desired stylistic genre (formal or informal, modern or traditional etc.), and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the prescribed budget.

===Location===
A garden's location can have a substantial influence on its design. Topographical landscape features such as steep slopes, vistas, hills, and outcrops may suggest or determine aspects of design such as layout and can be used and augmented in order to create a particular impression.&lt;ref name="6 Most Beautiful Garden Designs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dronezon.com/best-drone-videos/six-most-beautiful-gardens-by-drone-calms-the-heart-and-mind/|title=6 Most Beautiful Gardens Designed To Calm The Mind|accessdate=September 20, 2015|work=Dronezon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soils of the site will affect what types of plant may be grown, as will the garden's [[climate zone]] and various [[microclimate]]s. The locational context of the garden can also influence its design. For example, an urban setting may require a different design style In contrast to a rural one. Similarly, a windy coastal location may necessitate a different treatment compared to a sheltered inland site.

===Soil===
The quality of a garden's [[soil]] can have a significant influence on a garden's design and its subsequent success. Soil influences the availability of water and nutrients, the activity of soil micro-organisms, and temperature within the root zone, and thus may have a determining effect on the types of plants which will grow successfully in the garden. However, soils may be replaced or improved in order to make them more suitable.

Traditionally, garden soil is improved by amendment, the process of adding beneficial materials to the native subsoil and particularly the [[topsoil]]. The added materials, which may consist of compost, [[peat]], sand, mineral dust, or manure, among others, are mixed with the soil to the preferred depth. The amount and type of amendment may depend on many factors, including the amount of existing soil humus, the soil structure (clay, silt, sand, loam etc.), the soil acidity/alkalinity, and the choice of plants to be grown. One source states that, "conditioning the soil thoroughly before planting enables the plants to establish themselves quickly and so play their part in the design."&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York: A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.213. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all gardens are, or should be, amended in this manner, since many plants prefer an impoverished soil. In this case, poor soil is better than a rich soil that has been artificially enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1998). ''Natural Landscapes.'' New York : Dorling Kindersly Limited, pp.54. {{ISBN|0-7894-1995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablehorticulture.com/myth-soil_amendments.pdf|title=Welcome sustainablehorticulture.com - BlueHost.com|website=www.sustainablehorticulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===
The design of a garden can be affected by the nature of its boundaries, both external and internal, and in turn the design can influence the boundaries, including via creation of new ones. Planting can be used to modify an existing boundary line by softening or widening it. Introducing internal boundaries can help divide or break up a garden into smaller areas.

The main types of boundary within a garden are hedges, walls and fences. A hedge may be evergreen or deciduous, formal or informal, short or tall, depending on the style of the garden and purpose of the boundary. A wall has a strong foundation beneath it at all points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Garden DIY Expert|publisher=pbi publications|year=1992|ISBN=0 903505 37 1|author=Dr D. G. Hessayon|authorlink = D. G. Hessayon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually - but not always - built from brick, stone or concrete blocks. A fence differs from a wall in that it is anchored only at intervals, and is usually constructed using wood or metal (such as iron or wire mesh).

Boundaries may be constructed for several reasons: to keep out livestock or intruders, to provide privacy, to create shelter from strong winds and provide microclimates, to screen unattractive structures or views, and to create an element of surprise.

===Surfaces===
[[Image:Planting-design.jpg|thumb|right|Naturalistic planting design]]
In temperate western gardens, a smooth expanse of lawn is often considered essential to a garden. However garden designers may use other surfaces, for example those "made up of loose gravel, small pebbles, or wood chips" in order to create a different appearance and feel.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York : A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.226. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers may also utilise the contrast in texture and color between different surfaces in order to create an overall pattern in the design.

Surfaces for paths and access points are chosen for practical as well as aesthetic reasons. Issues such as safety, maintenance and durability may need to be considered by the designer. Gardens designed for public access need to cope with heavier foot traffic and hence may utilise surfaces – such as resin-bonded gravel – that are rarely used in private gardens.

===Planting design===
Planting design requires [[design]] talent and aesthetic judgement combined with a good level of horticultural, ecological and cultural knowledge. It includes two major traditions: formal rectilinear planting design (Persia and Europe); and formal asymmetrical (Asia) and [[naturalistic planting design]].

====History====
[[Persian gardens]] are credited with originating aesthetic and diverse planting design. A correct Persian garden will be divided into four sectors with water being very important for both irrigation and aesthetics. The four sectors symbolize the Zoroastrian elements of sky, earth, water and plants.&lt;ref name="The Persian Garden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372/|title=The Persian Garden|accessdate=January 25, 2011|work=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting in ancient and Medieval European gardens was often a mix of herbs for medicinal use, vegetables for consumption, and flowers for decoration. Purely aesthetic planting layouts developed after the Medieval period in [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|Renaissance gardens]], as are shown in late-renaissance paintings and plans. The designs of the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] were geometrical and plants were used to form spaces and patterns. The [[gardens of the French Renaissance]] and Baroque [[Garden à la française]] era continued the '[[formal garden]]' planting aesthetic.

In Asia the asymmetrical traditions of planting design in [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese gardens]] originated in the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] of China. The gardens' plantings have a controlled but naturalistic aesthetic. In Europe the arrangement of plants in informal groups developed as part of the [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style, and subsequently the [[French landscape garden]], and was strongly influenced by the [[picturesque]] art movement.

====Application====
[[File:Garden chairs and table, Birkenhead - DSC09774.JPG|thumb|Garden chairs and table]]
A planting plan gives specific instructions, often for a [[general contractor|contractor]] about how the soil is to be prepared, what species are to be planted, what size and spacing is to be used and what maintenance operations are to be carried out under the contract. Owners of private gardens may also use planting plans, not for contractual purposes, as an aid to thinking about a design and as a record of what has been planted. A [[planting strategy]] is a long term strategy for the design, establishment and management of different types of vegetation in a landscape or garden.

Planting can be established by directly employed gardeners and horticulturalists or it can be established by a landscape contractor (also known as a landscape gardener). Landscape contractors work to drawings and specifications prepared by garden designers or landscape architects.

===Garden furniture===
{{Main|Garden furniture}}

Garden furniture may range from a ''patio set'' consisting of a [[Table (furniture)|table]], four or six [[chair]]s and a [[Umbrella|parasol]], through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Garden Furniture'', Charles Thonger, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, {{ISBN|0-554-70114-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patio heater]]s, that run on bottled [[butane]] or [[propane]], are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A [[picnic table]], is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden.

The materials used to manufacture modern patio furniture include [[Rock (geology)|stones]], [[metal]]s, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]]s, [[resins]], [[glass]], and [[Wood preservation|treated]] [[wood]]s.

===Sunlight===
{{See also|Shade garden}}
While sunlight is not always easily controlled by the gardener, it is an important element of garden design. The amount of available light is a critical factor in determining what plants may be grown. Sunlight will, therefore, have a substantial influence on the character of the garden. For example, a rose garden is generally not successful in full shade, while a garden of hostas may not thrive in hot sun. As another example, a vegetable garden may need to be placed in a sunny location, and if that location is not ideal for the overall garden design goals, the designer may need to change other aspects of the garden.

In some cases, the amount of available sunlight can be influenced by the gardener. The location of trees, other shade plants, garden structures, or, when designing an entire property, even buildings, might be selected or changed based on their influence in increasing or reducing the amount of sunlight provided to various areas of the property.

In other cases, the amount of sunlight is not under the gardener's control. Nearby buildings, plants on other properties, or simply the climate of the local area, may limit the available sunlight. Or, substantial changes in the light conditions of the garden may not be within the gardener's means. In this case, it is important to plan a garden that is compatible with the existing light conditions.

===Lighting===
Garden lighting can be an important aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, it is more important to determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.

Photosynthesis provides the energy required to produce the energy source of plants.

Phototropism is the effect of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light.&lt;ref&gt;American Horticultural Society (1980). ''Houseplants.'' Ortho Books and the Franklin Library,&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodism is a plant’s response or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.&lt;ref&gt;"Phoroperiodism." ''The Merriam-Webster Dicrionary Online.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Formal Garden|formal garden]] in the [[Persian garden]] and European [[history of gardening|garden design traditions]] is rectilinear and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese garden]]s. The [[Zen garden]] of rocks, moss and raked gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. [[Tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[subshrub]]s and other [[leaf|foliage]] are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. A French garden or [[Garden à la française]], is a specific kind of formal garden, laid out in the manner of [[André Le Nôtre]]; it is centered on the façade of a building, with radiating [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and paths of gravel, lawns, [[parterre]]s and pools (''bassins'') of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with [[fountain]]s and sculpture.

The [[Garden à la française]] style has origins in fifteenth-century [[Italian Renaissance garden]]s, such as the [[Villa d'Este]], [[Boboli Gardens]], and [[Villa Lante]] in Italy. The style was brought to France and expressed in the [[gardens of the French Renaissance]]. Some of the earliest formal [[parterre]]s of clipped evergreens were those laid out at [[Anet]] by [[Claude Mollet]], the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted deep into the 18th century. The [[Gardens of Versailles]] are an ultimate example of Garden à la française, composed of many different distinct gardens, and designed by [[André Le Nôtre]].

[[English Renaissance]] gardens in a rectilinear formal design were a feature of the [[stately homes]]. The introduction of the parterre was at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s. In the early eighteenth century, the publication of [[Dezallier d'Argenville]], '' La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (1709) was translated into English and German, and was the central document for the later formal gardens of Continental Europe.

Traditional formal [[Spanish garden]] design evolved with [[Persian garden]] and [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|European Renaissance garden]] influences. The internationally renowned [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]], built in the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus]] era, have influenced design for centuries. The [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] was located in the celebrated [[Maria Luisa Park]] (''Parque de Maria Luisa'') designed by [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevilla5.com/monuments/plespana.html Sevilla-Parque de Maria Luisa. accessed 8 April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal gardening in the Italian and French manners was reintroduced at the turn of the twentieth century. [[Beatrix Farrand]]'s formal Italian garden areas at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Achille Duchêne]]'s restored French water parterre at [[Blenheim Palace]] in England are examples of the modern formal garden. The Conservatory Garden in [[Central Park]] of [[New York City]] features a formal garden, as do many other parks and estates such as [[Filoli]] in California.

The simplest formal garden would be a box-trimmed hedge lining or enclosing a carefully laid out [[flowerbed]] or garden bed of simple geometric shape, such as a [[knot garden]]. The more developed and elaborate formal gardens contain statuary and fountains.

===English Landscape and Naturalistic gardens===
{{Main|English garden|Landscape garden}} {{See also|List of landscape gardens}}
The [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style practically swept away the geometries of earlier English and European Renaissance formal gardens. [[William Kent]] and [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] were leading proponents, among many other designers. The naturalistic [[English garden|English Garden]] style (French:'' Jardin anglais'', Italian: ''Giardino all'inglese'', German: ''Englischer Landschaftsgarten'') of the 1730s and on transformed private and civic garden design across Europe. The [[French landscape garden|French Landscape Garden]] subsequently continued the style's development on the Continent.

===Cottage gardens===
{{Main|Cottage garden}}
A cottage garden uses an informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. Cottage gardens go back many centuries, but their popularity grew in 1870s England in response to the more structured Victorian [[English garden|English estate gardens]] that used restrained designs with massed beds of brilliantly colored greenhouse annuals. They are more casual by design, depending on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The influential British garden authors and designers, [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] at [[Gravetye Manor]] in [[Sussex]], and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] at [[Munstead Wood]] in [[Surrey]], both wrote and gardened in [[England]]. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings were an influence in Europe and the United States. Also influential half a century later was [[Margery Fish]], whose surviving garden at [[East Lambrook Manor]] emphasizes, among other things, native plant life and the natural patterns produced by self-spreading and self-seeding.

The earliest cottage gardens were far more practical than modern versions—with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with fruit trees, beehives, and even livestock if land allowed. Flowers were used to fill any spaces in between. Over time, flowers became more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-James, ''The Pleasure Garden'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations of the more traditional English cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitchen garden or potager===
{{Main|Kitchen garden}}
[[Image:VillandryPotager.jpg|thumb|right|Formal potager at Villandry, France]]
[[Image:Shakespeare garden.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from [[Walter Crane]]'s 1906 book,''Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden: a Posy from the Plays'']]
The traditional kitchen garden, also known as a potager, is a seasonally used space separate from the rest of the residential garden – the ornamental plants and lawn areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots with square or rectangular beds, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its history, but also its design.

The kitchen garden may be a [[landscape]] feature that can be the central feature of an ornamental, all-season landscape, but can be little more than a humble vegetable plot. It is a source of [[herb]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[flower]]s, but it is also a structured garden space, a design based on repetitive geometric patterns.

The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent [[perennials]] or woody plantings around (or among) the [[annual plants]].

===Shakespeare garden===
{{Main|Shakespeare garden}}

A Shakespeare garden is a themed garden that cultivates plants mentioned in the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, particularly the [[United States]], these are often public gardens associated with parks, universities, and Shakespeare festivals. Shakespeare gardens are sites of cultural, educational, and romantic interest and can be locations for outdoor weddings.

Signs near the plants usually provide relevant quotations. A Shakespeare garden usually includes several dozen species, either in herbaceous profusion or in a geometric layout with [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]] dividers. Typical amenities are walkways and benches and a weather-resistant bust of Shakespeare. Shakespeare gardens may accompany [[Tudorbethan architecture|reproductions of Elizabethan architecture]]. Some Shakespeare gardens also grow species typical of the Elizabethan period but not mentioned in Shakespeare's plays or poetry.

===Rock garden===
{{main|Rock garden}}
[[Image:RockGarden-NaturalStyle-19990622a.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A naturalistic rockery in England]]
[[File:Waterfall at Rock Garden, Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|[[Rock Garden, Chandigarh|Rock garden]] in [[Chandigarh]], [[India]]]]

A rock garden, also known as a rockery or an [[alpine garden]], is a type of garden that features extensive use of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[Rock (geology)|stones]], along with plants native to rocky or [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments.

Rock garden plants tend to be small, both because many of the species are naturally small, and so as not to cover up the rocks. They may be grown in troughs (containers), or in the ground. The plants will usually be types that prefer well-drained [[soil]] and less water.

The usual form of a rock garden is a pile of rocks, large and small, aesthetically arranged, and with small gaps between, where the plants will be rooted. Some rock gardens incorporate [[bonsai]].

Some rock gardens are designed and built to look like natural [[outcrop]]s of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane and plants are often used to conceal the joints between the stones. This type of rock garden was popular in Victorian times, often designed and built by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in modern campus or commercial [[landscape architecture|landscaping]], but can also be applied in smaller private gardens.

The [[Japanese rock garden]], in the west often referred to as ''Zen garden'', is a special kind of rock garden which contains few plants.
Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as [[landscape]] features in tropical countries such as [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=Thai Garden Style|year=1996|publisher=Asia Books Co., Ltd.|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy plastic liners to stop unwanted plant growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Rock Gardens|url=http://www.thaigardendesign.com/landscaping/2009/11/thai-rock-gardens.html|publisher=Thai Garden Design|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Maintenance a Pain? Stone Gardens Are the Way To Go!|url=http://www.thaigardendesign.com/landscaping/2013/01/plant-maintenance-a-pain-stone-gardens-are-the-way-to-go.html|publisher=Thai Garden Design|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native garden===
{{main|Natural landscaping}}
Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of [[native plants]], including trees, shrubs, [[groundcover]], and grasses which are [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the [[geographic area]] of the garden.
[[Image:Banksia spinulosa claret styles Georges River NP email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'', a Sydney local plant which attracts wildlife]]
Natural landscaping is adapted to the [[climate]], [[geography]] and [[hydrology]] and should require no [[pesticides]], [[fertilizers]] and watering to maintain, given that [[native plants]] have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years. However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or [[Landscape|weedy landscapes]].

Native plants suit today's interest in "[[low-maintenance]]" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without [[irrigation]] or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases.

Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time.

Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, [[pollinator]]s, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted [[introduced species]], [[cultivar]]s, and [[invasive species]]. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, or natural communities.&lt;ref name=Tallamy&gt;{{citation|title=Bringing Nature Home: How You Can Sustain Wildlife with Native Plants|author=Douglas Tallamy|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=9781604691467|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szK9uNKvTkQC|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no [[soil amendments]], irrigation, pesticides, and [[herbicide]]s for a lower maintenance, more [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] landscape.

===East Asian gardens===
{{Main|Chinese garden|Japanese garden|Japanese rock garden|Korean garden}}

Japanese and Korean gardens, originally influenced by [[Chinese garden]]s, can be found at [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples and historic sites, private homes, in neighborhood or city parks, and at historical [[landmark]]s such as [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples. Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the [[Western world]] and Japan are [[Japanese garden|gardens]] in the [[Japanese rock garden|''karesansui'' (rock garden)]] tradition. The [[Ryōan-ji]] temple garden is a well-known example. There are Japanese gardens of various styles, with plantings and often evoking ''wabi sabi'' simplicity. In [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], garden-making is a high art, intimately linked to the arts of [[calligraphy]] and [[ink painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26262/garden-and-landscape-design|title=Garden and landscape design: Japanese|accessdate=7 March 2008|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary garden===
[[File:Contemporarygarden2.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary garden]]
[[File:Contemporarygarden1.jpg|thumb|Contemporary water feature]]The contemporary style garden has gained popularity in the UK in the last 10 years. This is partly due to the increase of modern housing with small gardens as well as the cultural shift towards contemporary design {{who|date=April 2015}}. This style of garden can be defined by the use 'clean' design lines, with focus on hard landscaping materials like stone, hardwood, rendered walls. Planting style is bold but simple with the use of drifts of one or two plants that repeat throughout the design. Grasses are a very popular choice for this style of design. Lighting effects also play an integral role in the modern garden. Subtle lighting effects can be achieved with the use of carefully placed low voltage LED lights incorporated into paving and walls.

===Residential gardens===
{{See also|front garden|back garden}}
{{distinguish|forest garden}}
A residential or private domestic garden, is the most common form of garden and is in proximity to a [[house|residence]], such as the '[[front garden]]' or '[[back garden]]'. The front garden may be a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and local laws. While typically found in the [[yard (land)|yard]] of the residence, a garden may also be established on a [[Roof garden|roof]], in an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] or [[courtyard]], on a [[balcony]], in [[windowbox]]es, or on a [[Patio garden|patio]]. Residential gardens are typically designed at [[human scale]], as they are most often intended for private use. However, the garden of a [[great house]] or a large [[estate (house)|estate]] may be larger than a public park.

Residential gardens may feature specialized gardens, such as those for exhibiting one particular type of plant, or special features, such as [[rockery]] or [[water garden|water features]]. They are also used for growing [[herbs]] and [[vegetables]] and are thus an important element of [[sustainability]].

'''Geo-Enable''' is a [[neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Geospatial]] or [[Geographic]] and [[Enablement (disambiguation)|Enablement]]. Associated words include Geo-Enablment and Geo-Enabling.

As a verb it is increasingly used in the fields of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS), Web Development, Mobility, [[Information Management]] (IM) and [[Information technology|IT]]. Similar to the terms 'Web-Enabled' or 'GPS-Enabled' - 'Geo-Enable' suggests the application of location or geospatial information as part of business processes or using 'location intelligence' to augment non-spatial [[information systems]] and/or [[Business Intelligence]] (BI).

Geospatial Enablement can be thought of as the integrated use of Geographic Information, as opposed to using Geographic Information within a geographic and technology-centric environment of something such as a [[GPS]] or GIS.

A definition given by GeoEnable Ltd is:

'Geo-Enablement n.:
1. Embedding and leveraging the power of location and geography within workflows and business processes.
2. The act of deriving and utilising geography within non-spatial information.
3. The state of being enabled using location information.' &lt;ref name="Geo-Enablement"&gt;GeoEnable. ''What is Geo-Enablement?'' GeoEnable Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by the US Government is:

'To geo-enable is to apply geospatial capabilities to a business process in order to establish the authoritative spatial location of business data, and enable contextual spatial analysis.' &lt;ref name="GeospatialPlatform2010"&gt;US Government. ''Modernization Roadmap for the Geospatial Platform (Version 4.0)''. US Department of the Interior &amp; Federal Geographic Data Committee, March 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GeoGreatBarr.png|thumb|A Geo [[microformat]], detected on the Wikipedia page for [[Great Barr]], by [[Firefox]]'s Operator extension. Users may add alternative mapping sources to those shown, which are included by default.]]

'''Geo''' is a [[microformats|microformat]] used for marking up [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] geographical coordinates ([[latitude]];[[longitude]]) in [[(X)HTML]].&lt;ref name="geo-spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microformats.org/wiki/geo|title=Geo Spec|publisher=microformats community|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although termed a "draft" specification, this is a formality, and the format is stable and in widespread use;&lt;ref name="HTML5-doc-ext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5doctor.com/microformats/|title=Extending HTML5 — Microformats|work=HTML5 Doctor|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; not least as a sub-set of the published [[hCalendar]]&lt;ref name="hCal-spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar|title=hCalendar 1.0 Spec|publisher=Microformats community|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hCard]]&lt;ref name="hCard-spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard|title=hCard 1.0 Spec|publisher=Microformats Community|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; microformat specifications, neither of which is still a draft.&lt;ref name="hCal-spec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hCard-spec" /&gt;

Use of Geo allows parsing tools (for example other websites, or [[Firefox]]'s [[Operator (extension)|Operator extension]]) to extract the locations, and display them using some other website or [[map]]ping tool, or to load them into a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device, index or aggregate them, or convert them into an alternative format.

==Usage==
*If latitude is present, so must be longitude, and vice versa.
*The same number of decimal places should be used in each value, including trailing zeroes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Must'' and ''should'' are used per the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] document {{IETF RFC|2119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geo microformat is applied using three [[HTML#Attributes|HTML classes]]. For example, the marked-up text:

&lt;source lang="html"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Belvide: 52.686; -2.193&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

becomes:

&lt;source lang="html"&gt;
&lt;div class="geo"&gt;Belvide: &lt;span class="latitude"&gt;52.686&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="longitude"&gt;-2.193&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

by adding the class-attribute values "geo", "latitude" and "longitude".

This will display &lt;!-- this section includes a live Geo microformat - please edit with care --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="geo"&gt;
Belvide: &lt;span class="latitude"&gt;52.686&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="longitude"&gt;-2.193&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and a geo microformat for that location, [[Belvide Reservoir]], which will be detected, on this page,  by microformat parsing tools.

==hCard==
Each Geo microformat may be wrapped in an [[hCard]] microformat, allowing for the inclusion of personal, organisational or venue names, postal addresses, telephone contacts, [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, pictures, etc.

==Extensions==
There are three active proposals, none mutually-exclusive, to extend the geo microformat:
* [http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-extension-strawman geo-extension] - for representing coordinates on other planets, moons etc., and with non-WGS84 schema
* [http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-elevation-examples geo-elevation] - for representing altitude
* [http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-waypoint-examples geo-waypoint] - for representing routes and boundaries, using waypoints

A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

=== Defining and derived parameters ===
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoid parameters}}

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of annual average temperatures as a function of location.]]

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

{{legend|#ef8888|Tropical}} ]]

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

'''Geotagging''' or '''GeoTagging''', is the process of adding geographical identification [[metadata]] to various media such as a [[geotagged photograph]] or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qrd.by |title=Geo Tagged QR Codes |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds and is a form of [[geospatial metadata]]. This data usually consists of [[geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude coordinates]], though they can also include [[altitude]], [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]], distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a [[time stamp]].

Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image [[search engine]]. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AP/2008/01/18/5437214?extID=10051 |title= GPS adds dimension to online photos |author=Anick Jesdanun, AP |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;!-- this has a dead URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the [[Perspective (visual)|point of view]], and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location.

The related term [[geocoding]] refers to the process of taking non-coordinate based geographical identifiers, such as a street address, and finding associated [[geographic coordinates]] (or vice versa for [[reverse geocoding]]).  Such techniques can be used together with geotagging to provide alternative search techniques.

==Popular examples==
Geotagging has become a popular feature on several social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.

[[Facebook]] users can geotag photos that can be added to the  page of the location they are tagging. Users may also use a feature that allows them to find nearby Facebook friends, by generating a list of people according to the location tracker in their mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/24/friendshake-facebooks-new-mobile-feature-for-finding-people-nearby-and-a-highlight-killer/ |title= Facebook’s New Mobile Feature For Finding People Around You |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instagram]] uses a map feature that allows users to geotag photos. The map layout pin points specific photos that the user has taken on a world map.

==Geotagging techniques==
The geographical location data used in geotagging will, in almost every case, be derived from the [[global positioning system]], and based on a [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]-coordinate system that presents each location on the earth from 180° west through 180° east along the [[Equator]] and 90° north through 90° south along the [[prime meridian]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Geotagging photos===
{{main|Geotagged photograph}}
There are two main options for geotagging photos; capturing GPS information at the time the photo is taken or "attaching" the photograph to a map after the picture is taken.

In order to capture GPS data at the time the photograph is captured, the user must have a camera with built in GPS or a standalone GPS along with a digital camera. Because of the requirement for wireless service providers in United States to supply more precise location information for 911 calls by September 11, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/wireless911srvc.html |title=Wireless 911 Services |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; more and more cell phones have built-in GPS chips.  Most smart phones already use a GPS chip along with built-in cameras to allow users to automatically geotag photos. Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fireflyarticles.com/photography/photographers-have-several-camera-options-for-geotagging-pictures-with-gps-points-22.html|title=Photographers Have Several Camera Options for Geotagging Pictures with GPS Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings. Traditional GPS does not need cell phone towers and uses standard GPS signals outside of urban areas. Traditional GPS tends to use more battery power. Almost any digital camera can be coupled with a stand-alone GPS and post processed with photo mapping software, to write the location information to the image's [[exif]] header.

===GPS formats===
GPS coordinates may be represented in text in a number of ways, with more or fewer [[decimal]]s:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Template

|-
| [-]d.d, [-]d.d

|}

==Geotagging standards in electronic file formats==

===Photographs===
With photos stored in [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]] and many other file formats, the geotag information, storing camera location and sometimes heading, is typically embedded in the [[metadata]], stored in [[Exchangeable image file format]] (Exif) or [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) format. These data are not visible in the picture itself but are read and written by special programs and most [[digital camera]]s and modern [[Image scanner|scanners]].  Latitude and longitude are stored in units of degrees with decimals.&lt;ref&gt;In this format, a positively signed coordinate indicates Northern or Eastern hemisphere, while negative sign indicates Southern or Western hemisphere.&lt;/ref&gt;  This geotag information can be read by many programs, such as the [[cross-platform]] [[open source]] [[ExifTool]]. An example readout for a photo might look like:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS Latitude                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57 deg 38' 56.83" N, 10 deg 24' 26.79" E&lt;/code&gt;

or the same coordinates could also be presented as decimal degrees:

 &lt;code&gt;GPS&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Longitude                   : 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;GPS Position                    : 57.64911 10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

When stored in Exif, the coordinates are represented as a series of rational numbers in the GPS sub-IFD.  Here is a hexadecimal dump of the relevant section of the Exif metadata (with [[Endianness|big-endian]] byte order):

=== Remote sensing data ===
In the field of [[remote sensing]] the geotagging goal is to store coordinates of every pixel in the image. One approach is used with the [[orthophoto]]s where we store coordinates of four corners and all the other pixels can be georeferenced by [[interpolation]]. The four corners are stored using [[GeoTIFF]] or [[World file]] standards. [[Hyperspectral imaging|Hyperspectral images]] take a different approach defining a separate file of the same spatial dimensions as the image where [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of each pixel are stored as two 2D layers in so called ''Input geometry data'' (IGM) files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENVI Classic Tutorial: Georeferencing Images Using Input Geometry|url=http://www.exelisvis.com/portals/0/pdfs/envi/Georef_Input_Geometry.pdf|publisher=[[Exelis]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as GEO files.

===Audio/video files===
Audio/video files can be geotagged via: metadata, audio encoding, overlay, or with companion files.  Metadata records the geospatial data in the encoded video file to be decoded for later analysis. One of the standards used with [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] is '''[[:File:MISB_Standard_0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]''' which allows geocoding of corner points and horizon lines in individual video frames.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:MISB Standard 0601.pdf|MISB Standard 0601]]&lt;/ref&gt; Audio encoding involves a process of converting gps data into audio data such as modem squawk. Overlay involves overlaying GPS data as text on the recorded video.  Companion files are separate data files which correspond to respective audio/video files.  Companion files are typically found in the .KML and .GPX data formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruggedvid.com/geospatial/|title=Airborne Geospatial Video Recorders, Cameras, and Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For audio and video files which use the [[Vorbis comment|vorbiscomment]] metadata format (including [[Opus (audio codec)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[FLAC]], [[Speex]], and [[Ogg Theora]]), there is a proposed GEO LOCATION&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.xiph.org/VorbisComment#Geo_Location_fields|title=VorbisComment – XiphWiki|website=wiki.xiph.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; field which can be used. Like all vorbiscomments, it is plain text, and it takes the form:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=(decimal latitude);(decimal longitude);([optional]elevation in meters)&lt;/code&gt;

for example:

&lt;code&gt;GEO_LOCATION=35.1592;-98.4422;410&lt;/code&gt;

===SMS messages===
The [[GeoSMS]] standard works by embedding one or more [[Geo URI|'geo' URI]]s in the body of an SMS, for example:

:&lt;code&gt;I'm at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=16&lt;/code&gt;

===DNS entries===
{{main|LOC record}}
RFC 1876 defines a means for expressing location information in the [[Domain Name System]]. LOC resources records can specify the latitude, longitude, altitude, precision of the location, and the physical size of on entity attached to an IP address. However, in practice not all IP addresses have such a record, so it is more common to use [[geolocation]] services to find the physical location of an IP address.

===HTML pages===

====ICBM method====
{{main|ICBM address}}
The GeoURL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geourl.org/add.html |title=Adding yourself to GeoURL |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515145826/http://geourl.org/add.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; method requires the [[ICBM address|ICBM]] tag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-daviel-html-geo-tag-08.txt| title=Geographic registration of HTML documents |author=The Internet Engineering Task Force |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plus optional [[Dublin Core]] metadata), which is used to geotag standard web pages in [[HTML]] format:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="ICBM" content="50.167958, -97.133185"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The similar Geo Tag format allows the addition of placename and region tags:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.position" content="50.167958;-97.133185"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.placename" content="Rockwood Rural Municipality, Manitoba, Canada"&gt;
 &lt;meta name="geo.region" content="ca-mb"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====RDF feeds====
The [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] method is defined by W3 Group and presents the information in RDF tags:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/ |title=Basic Geo (WGS84 lat/long) Vocabulary |author=W3C Semantic Web Interest Group |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"&gt;
  &lt;geo:Point&gt;
  &lt;geo:lat&gt;55.701&lt;/geo:lat&gt;
  &lt;geo:long&gt;12.552&lt;/geo:long&gt;
  &lt;/geo:Point&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Microformat====
The [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] allows coordinates within HyperText Markup Language pages to be marked up in such a way that they can be "discovered" by software tools. Example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
 &lt;span class="geo"&gt;
    &lt;span class="latitude"&gt;50.167958&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class="longitude"&gt;-97.133185&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A proposal has been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Geo Extension Straw-Man Proposal | url=http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-extension-strawman | accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend Geo to cover other bodies, such as [[Mars]] and the [[Moon]].

An example is the [[Flickr]] photo-sharing Web site, which provides geographic data for any [[geotagged photo]] in all of the above-mentioned formats.

===Geotagging in tag-based systems===
No industry standards exist, however there are a variety of techniques for adding geographical identification metadata to an information resource. One convention, established by the website [[Geobloggers]] and used by more and more sites, e.g. photo sharing sites [[Panoramio]] and [[Flickr]], and the social bookmarking site [[del.icio.us]], enables content to be found via a location search. Such sites allow users to add metadata to an information resource via a set of so-called ''machine tags'' (see [[folksonomy]]).

 &lt;code&gt;geotagged&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lat=57.64911&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;geo:lon=10.40744&lt;/code&gt;

This describes the geographic coordinates of a particular location in terms of [[latitude]] (geo:lat) and [[longitude]] (geo:lon). These are expressed in decimal degrees in the [[WGS84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]], which has become something of a default geodetic datum with the advent of [[GPS]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Using three tags works within the constraint of having tags that can only be single 'words'. Identifying geotagged information resources on sites like [[Flickr]] and [[del.icio.us]] is done by searching for the 'geotagged' tag, since the tags beginning 'geo:lat=' and 'geo:lon=' are necessarily very variable.

Another option is to tag with a [[Geohash]]:

 &lt;code&gt;geo:hash=u4pruydqqvj&lt;/code&gt;

A further convention proposed by [[FlickrFly]] adds tags to specify the suggested viewing angle and range when the geotagged location is viewed in [[Google Earth]]:

 &lt;code&gt;ge:head=225.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:tilt=45.00&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;ge:range=560.00&lt;/code&gt;

These three tags would indicate that the camera is pointed heading 225° (south west), has a 45° tilt and is 560 metres from the subject.

Where the above methods are in use, their coordinates may differ from those specified by the photo's internal Exif data, for example because of a correction or a difference between the camera's location and the subject's.

In order to integrate geotags in social media and enhance text readability or oral use, the concept of 'meetag' or tag-to-meet has been proposed. Differing from hashtag construction, meetag includes the geolocation information after an underscore. A meetag is therefore a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with an underscore ("_"). Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services may be tagged by putting "_" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g. "There is a concert going _montreuxjazzfestival", "the world wide web was invented _cern _geneve", ...) or appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meet.ag |title=Web page for the 'meetag standard' proposition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201304/http://meet.ag/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoblogging===
Geoblogging attaches specific geographic location information to [[blog]] entries via ''geotags''. Searching a list of blogs and pictures tagged using geotag technology allows users to select areas of specific interest to them on interactive maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=294109 |title=Example of pictures with geotag, using mobile phone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of [[GPS]] technology, along with the development of various online applications, has fueled the popularity of such tagged blogging, {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} and the combination of [[GPS Phone]]s and [[GSM localization]], has led to the [[moblog]]ging, where blog posts are tagged with exact position of the user.  [[Real-time geotagging]] relays automatically geotagged media such as photos or video to be published and shared immediately.

For better integration and readability of geotags into blog texts, the [[meetag]] syntax has been proposed, which transforms any word, sentence, or precise geolocalization coordinates prefixed with an underscore into a 'meetag'. It not only lets one express a precise location but also takes in account dynamically changing geolocations.

===Wikipedia article geosearching apps===
{{Cleanup|date=July 2011}}
One of the first attempts to initiate the geotagging aspect of searching and locating articles seems to be the now-inoperative site Wikinear.com, launched in 2008, which showed the user Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to one's current location.&lt;ref&gt;Willison, Simon. (2008). "[http://simonwillison.net/2008/Mar/22/wikinear/ Wininear.com, OAuth and Fire Eagle]", SimonWillison.net, Mar 22 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 app [[Cyclopedia (iPhone application)|Cyclopedia]] works relatively well showing geotagged Wikipedia articles located within several miles of ones location, integrated with a street-view mode, and 360-degree mode.

The app Respotter Wiki, launched in 2009, claims to feature Wikipedia searching via a map, also allowing users to interact with people around them, via messaging and reviews, etc. The app, in its current function, however, seems to give only geotagged photo results.

As of 2017, the [[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt_Georeferenzierung/Hauptseite/Wikipedia-World/en|Wikipedia-World Project]] provides a [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wp-world/karte.php?la=en simple map search tool] which can display tagged articles near to a particular location, as well as a variety of more sophisticated tools integrated with external mapping services.

==Dangers of geotagging==
Following a scientific study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/hotsec10/tech/full_papers/Friedland.pdf |title=G. Friedland, R. Sommer: "Cybercasing the Joint: On the Privacy Implications of Geo-Tagging", 5th Usenix Hot Topics in Security Workshop (HotSec2010), Washington DC, August 2010. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several demonstrative websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleaserobme.com|title=Please Rob Me|website=www.pleaserobme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icanstalku.com |title=icanstalku.com |publisher=icanstalku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion on the privacy implications of geotagging has raised public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|N2vARzvWxwY|NBC Action News Smartphone pictures pose privacy risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heussner, Ki Mae, [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/celebrity-stalking-online-photos-give-location/story?id=11162352 "Celebrities' Photos, Videos May Reveal Location"], ''ABC News'', July 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19160-geotags-reveals-celeb-secrets.html Geo-tags reveal celeb secrets], 12 July 2010, by Jim Giles, New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=2 |title=Web Photos That Reveal Secrets Such As Where You Live / "MythBusters" host inadvertently reveals his home address on Twitter |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures taken with smartphones is often ignored by cell-phone users. As a result, people are often not aware that the photos they publish on the Internet have been geotagged. Many celebrities reportedly gave away their home location without knowing it. According to the study, a significant number of for-sale advertisements on [[Craigslist]], that were otherwise anonymized, contained geotags, thereby revealing the location of high-valued goods—sometimes in combination with clear hints to the absence of the offerer at certain times. Publishing photos and other media tagged with exact geolocation on the Internet allows random people to track an individual's location and correlate it with other information. Therefore, criminals could find out when homes are empty because their inhabitants posted geotagged and timestamped information both about their home address and their vacation residence. These dangers can be avoided by removing geotags with a [[metadata removal tool]] for photos before publishing them on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [http://www.superutils.com/products/exifcleaner/ ExifCleaner] and [http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30 JPEG &amp; PNG Stripper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;iPhone-App [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imetaphoto/id549115463 iMetaPhoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, four [[United States Army]] [[AH-64 Apache#United States Army|Apache helicopters]] were destroyed on the ground by Iraqi insurgent mortar fire; the insurgents had made use of embedded coordinates in web-published photographs (geotagging) taken of the helicopters by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/75165/Geotagging_poses_security_risks |title=Geotagging poses security risks |publisher=Army.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newly realised danger of geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and poachers on the whereabouts of often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these poachers, so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.

'''Hügelkultur''' is a [[horticulture|horticultural]] technique where a mound constructed from decaying wood debris and other [[compost]]able [[biomass]] plant materials is later (or immediately) planted as a [[raised bed]].  Adopted by [[permaculture]] advocates, it is suggested the technique helps to improve soil fertility, water retention, and soil warming, thus benefiting plants grown on or near such mounds.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name="Permaculture Magazine" /&gt;

==History==
Hügelkultur is a German word meaning mound culture or hill culture.&lt;ref name=Lauterbach /&gt; It is said to have been practiced in German and Eastern European societies for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

The term is first published in a 1962 German gardening booklet by Herrman Andrä.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Inspired by observation of the diversity and success of plants growing in a pile of woody debris, "mound culture" is suggested (as opposed to "flatland culture").&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; This was also posited as an easy way to utilise woody debris without burning, which was illegal.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Andrä appears to have been influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[biodynamic agriculture]]. Steiner developed his biodynamic philosophy through [[meditation]] and [[clairvoyance]], and rejected scientific inquiry on the grounds that his methods were “true and correct unto themselves.”&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=The Science Behind Biodynamic Preparations: A Literature Review |journal=HortTechnology |date=December 2013 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=814-819 |url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/23/6/814.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrä quotes a 1924 lecture on biodynamics by Steiner, which describes mixing of soil with composting or decaying material in earthen hillocks.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Joined by author Hans Beba, another German gardener, "Hill Culture - the horticultural method of the future" was revised and republished several times in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndräBeba"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beba, Hans |author2=Andrä, Herrman |title=Hügelkultur – die Gartenbaumethode der Zukunft |publisher=Waerland |location=Mannheim, Germany |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was later adopted and developed by [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture advocate.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; More recent permaculture advocates such as [[Paul Wheaton]] and [[Geoff Lawton]] strongly promote Hügelkultur beds as a perfect permaculture design.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul, [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds], retrieved 6/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===Construction===
[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed construction, shown without the top layer of soil]]
[[File:Hugelkultur.png|thumb|right|200px|Hügelkultur layout]]
In its basic form, mounds are constructed by piling logs, branches, plant waste, compost and additional soil directly on the ground. The pile has the form of a pyramid. The sides of the two slopes both have a grade of between 65 and 80 degrees.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt; The beds are usually about {{convert|3|ft|m}} by {{convert|6|ft|m}} in area and about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt; However, this height reduces as decomposition progresses.&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chalker-Scott |first1=Linda |title=Hugelkultur: What is it, and should it be used in home  gardens? |url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/12233/FS283E.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |publisher=Pullman, Washington : Washington State University Extension |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When positioned on sloped terrain, the beds need to be put at an angle to the hillside (rather than having them parallel to it). This makes sure the beds do not receive unequal amounts of water. In most cases, it is useful to have the beds positioned against the prevailing wind direction.

The raised bed can form light-duty [[swale (landform)|swales]], circles and mazes.&lt;ref name=Hemenway /&gt;&lt;ref name=Feineigle /&gt; Mounds may also be made from alternating layers of wood, sod,&lt;ref name=Shein /&gt; compost, straw, and soil. Although their construction is straightforward, planning is necessary to prevent steep slopes that would result in erosion.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

In his book ''Desert or Paradise: Restoring Endangered Landscapes Using Water Management, Including Lake and Pond Construction'', Holzer describes a method of constructing Hügelkultur which incorporates rubbish such as cardboard, clothes and kitchen waste. He recommends building mounds that are {{convert|1|meter|ft}} wide and any length. Mounds are built in a {{convert|0.7|meter|ft}} trench in sandy soil, and without a trench if the ground is wet.&lt;ref name=Holzer /&gt;

===Planting===
The mound is left to rest for several months before planting,&lt;ref name=Chalker-Scott2017 /&gt; although some advise immediate planting.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Anything can be grown on the raised beds, but if the bed will decompose/release its nutrients quickly (so long as it is not made of bulky materials like tree trunks), more demanding crops such as pumpkins, courgettes, cucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, sweet corn, celery, or potatoes are grown in the first year, after which the bed is used for less demanding crops like beans, peas, and strawberries.
===Lifespan===
The original German publications described the mounds as having a lifespan of 5-6 years, after which they had to be rebuilt from scratch.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

==Evidence==
As of 2017 there are no peer-reviewed scientific studies available regarding the efficacy of the technique.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; A few university student projects investigate Hügelkultur but have not been published in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

One small scale and short term student project investigated the Hügelkultur method as a potential use for yard trimmings waste, and also if lima beans, kale and okra planted on a Hügelkultur mound showed any signs of nutrient deficiency compared to a non-raised control bed. It was found that over 11 tons of yard trimmings were used in the mound, and no evidence of macronutrient deficiency could be detected in the crops in the short term.&lt;ref name="Adams2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=A |title=UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM SOLID WASTE RESEARCH PROGRAM Student Project Report: Hugelkultur  Gardening Technique Does not Result in Plant  Nutrient  Deficiencies and is a Potential Source Reduction   Strategy for Yard Trimmings Wastes |url=https://www.wisconsin.edu/waste-research/download/2013_student_reports/13%20MSN%20Adams%20Hugelkultur.pdf |date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, despite concerns that incorporation of large quantities of high carbon woody matter would lead to nitrogen immobilization and hence nitrogen deficiency in the crop, a higher level of nitrogen was found in the raised bed. However the micronutrient iron was lower relative to the control bed.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt; The author speculated that no nitrogen deficiency occurred since the roots of the plants did not penetrate past the superficial layers of the mound into the deeper wood-containing region.&lt;ref name="Adams2013" /&gt;

A student thesis investigated the water holding capacity of Hügelkultur beds and whether the technique could be useful to prevent [[karst]] rocky [[desertification]] in China.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laffoon |first1=M |title=A Quantitative Analysis Of Hugelkultur And Its Potential Application On Karst Rocky Desertified Areas In China |url=https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1641&amp;context=stu_hon_theses |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3 months of measurements, water concentration in hügel mounds remained high. Samples from hugel sites contained almost twice as much water as those from flat control plots. It was suggested that 1 Hectare of hügels has 3-10 times more water than a flat plot affected by karst rocky desertification.&lt;ref name=Laffoon2016 /&gt;

==Theory==
Many publications and websites advocate the technique based on personal experience of the authors.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Some have criticised the technique as lacking genuine scientific principles, and running counter to the ecological principles of soil building with [[litterfall]].&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; 

Hügelkultur is said to replicate the natural process of decomposition that occurs on forest floors, however in natural ecosystems wood would be present at the soil surface.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt; Trees that fall in a forest often become [[nurse log]]s&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; decaying and providing [[ecological facilitation]] to seedlings. As the wood decays, its porosity increases, allowing it to store water like a sponge. The water is slowly released back into the environment, benefiting nearby plants.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Hügelkultur beds are said to be ideal for areas where the underlying soil is of poor quality or compacted. They tend to be easier to maintain due to their relative height above the ground.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; 

Decomposition speed of organic material depends on the [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] of the material, among other factors. Wood breaks down relatively slowly because it has one of the highest carbon to nitrogen ratios of all organic matter that is used in composting. If the wood is not processed into smaller pieces with larger surface area to speed up chemical reactions, breakdown is even slower. The decomposition process may in the short term take more nitrogen from the soil through microbial activity ([[nitrogen immobilization]]), if not enough nitrogen is available.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008" /&gt; Thus in the short term the fertility of the soil may be decreased before eventually, perhaps after 1-2 years, the nitrogen level is increased past the original level.&lt;ref name="Seymour2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seymour |first1=John |title=The new self-sufficient gardener : the complete illustrated guide to planning, growing, storing and preserving your own garden produce |date=2008 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405321334 |pages=12,13 |edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally therefore, it is said to be advantageous to balance "browns" (e.g. woodchippings) with "greens" (e.g. leaves) for efficient composting, and to allow compost to become well-rotted before applying it a bed to prevent competition between soil bacteria and plants for nitrogen, reducing yield.

==Criticisms and controversy==
===Hügelkultur mounds as solid earthworks===
[[File:Hugelkultur arboretum.jpg|thumb|Hügelkultur bed with wildflower overplanting]]
Although Hügelkultur beds can safely retain water in light-duty applications (for example, conserving the moisture of rain that falls on the bed), creating heavy-duty rainwater retention areas behind Hügelkultur beds on contour, to catch [[surface runoff]] from surrounding areas, can be dangerous. Some designers conflate the Hügelkultur bed's appearance with that of solid [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], but Hügelkultur beds cannot predictably control large amounts of [[stormwater]] in the way that solid earthworks can. Whereas [[embankment dam]]s or the hillsides of [[swale (landform)|swales]] can be relied on to hold back many thousands of gallons of water for weeks to allow it to seep into the ground, and [[berm]]s can slow runoff, Hügelkultur beds are different in two ways: earthworks have no buoyant core (whereas Hügelkultur mounds contain logs), and the soil that they are made of is compacted. If fresh or dried timber is used in the bed, it may become buoyant in the water-saturated substrate, bursting from the soil covering and releasing all the sitting water through a breach. This can be an issue for years, until the wood is sufficiently rotten and infused with water. Another consideration is that Hügelkultur beds will degrade, shrinking over time into much lower mounds of soft, rich soil. This means that the retention area will have less depth as time goes on, but it also means that the uncompacted soil will remain a threat to breaching even if the logs become saturated.

There is a recorded instance of a breach occurring in a new project. Upon the first rainstorm, the retention areas behind the Hügelkultur beds filled with water and broke through. The released water carried the freshly-buried logs and dirt downhill, smashing a hole in a building being used as a church and filling the space with mud. No injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://permaculturenews.org/2015/11/06/dont-try-building-hugel-swales-this-is-a-very-and-i-mean-very-bad-idea/ |title=Don't Try Building Hugel Swales |publisher=permaculturenews.org |first=Jack |last=Spirko |date=November 6, 2015 |access-date=March 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some permaculturists have taken mild positions against the "hügel swales" still being promoted by other permaculturists, citing the danger and cross-purposes of Hügelkultur beds and swales.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Overfertilization, contamination of soil and water habitats===
Over-fertilized plants are said to have less flavor,&lt;ref name="Holzer2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holzer |first1=Sepp |title=Sepp Holzer's Permaculture: A Practical Guide to Small-Scale, Integrative Farming and Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |isbn=9781603583831 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNXK9kE-lOoC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and too much nitrogen can be consumed by eating certain plants which have been over-fertilised (e.g. spinach).&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Advocates state that overfertilization is a risk in the first year if woodchips are used, which will break down too fast.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; Instead raised beds made with whole logs release nutrients slowly over a period of years.&lt;ref name="Holzer2011" /&gt; It has been suggested that excessive use of decomposing organic matter in Hügelkultur could leach out and contaminate and disrupt soil and water habitats.&lt;ref name="Chalker-Scott2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">A '''land description'''  location of the written words which delineate a specific piece of [[real property]]. Also known as a "Legal Description". In the written transfer of real property, it is universally required that the instrument of conveyance ([[deed]]) include a written description of the property.

==Legal land description==
=== Canada ===
*In many parts of Canada the original subdivision of crown land was done by [[Township (Canada)|township]] surveys. Different sizes of townships have been used (e.g. Québec's irregularly shaped cantons and Ontario's concession townships), but all were designed to provide rectangular farm lots within a defined rural community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/history-of-cartography/#h3_jump_4 Canadian Encyclopedia, History of Cartography,Official Surveys:Cadastral Surveying], by L.M. Sebert&lt;/ref&gt; The survey of a township was essentially a subdivision survey, because the plan of the township was registered and the lots (sometimes called sections) were numbered. The description of a whole lot for legal purposes is complete in the identification of the township and the lot within the township.
* A legal land description in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta would be defined by the [[Dominion Land Survey]].  For example the village of Yarbo, [[Saskatchewan]] is located at the legal land description of SE-12-20-33-W1, which would be the South East [[Dominion Land Survey|quarter]] of [[Dominion Land Survey|Section]] 12, [[Township (Canada)|Township]] 20, [[Dominion Land Survey|Range]] 33, West of the first [[meridian (geography)|meridian]].
* A legal land description in British Columbia Fraser Valley Lower Mainland (Metro Vancouver) is defined by land surveys based out of New Westminster. Land in New Westminster Townsite corresponding to present day New Westminster is labelled as such while land outside the townsite is labelled as being in New Westminster District.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver, a Visual History, Bruce MacDonald, 1992, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Main subdivisions are [[District Lots]] that represent parcel sales to settlers mostly in the time from 1860-1890. District lots are numbered from DL1 to over DL3,000. These District Lots are still represented on the cadastral maps of British Columbia. Later these lots would be subdivided to form blocks and residential lots. A typical address would thus indicate a lot number, a block range, and the original District Lot from which it was subdivided.

'''Landscape detailing''' describes the process of integrating soft landscape materials and hard landscape materials to create a [[landscape design]]. It requires knowledge of:
*[[Landscape architecture]]
*[[Landscape engineering]]
*[[Soft landscape materials]]
*[[Hard landscape materials]]
*[[Landscape products]]
Designing Landscape detailing can be boiled down to three different steps:Function, Structure, and Appearance. Function allows you to satisfy the requirements of the landscape to serve a purpose. Structure is the physical implementation of function through the best available resources; usually those of a local character. Appearance is about obtaining visual satisfaction, commonly known as aesthetic values.

Landscape detailing can influence the attitude and mood of a landscape. A study was conducted on how young people feel when in a natural oriented landscape versus an engineered habitat. The results showed that more structured landscapes are preferred in young people. Detailing in landscape allows the designer to make choices that help influence the landscape; allowing the potential to be shown.(1)

Landscape can have an influence on how communities and societies evolve and vice verse. Communities can shape how the landscape is used based on the needs of the community. We can see an example of this in Canada's landscape and the role the railroads had in shaping the community. With the introduction of the railroad, Canada's wild lands were more susceptible to exploitation. On the contrary to that, the railroad system also allowed the community to experience Canada's array of National Parks.(2)

Landscape detailing is not just limited to actual land, but can also be seen as a way to improve waterfront area; making the waterfront a more appealing setting for the public to enjoy. Typically when addressing the relationship of landscape detailing and water, we think of drainage and how the landscape can be manipulated to serve the user; as to prevent flooding and maintain water flows.(3)

With today's every expanding technologies, there has been an increase in ways to convey landscape detailing. The visualization tools can be split into two categories; traditional and computerized. Traditional ways to convey details in the landscape would be simply a pen/pencil, paper maps, and models; while the computerized way would to use GIS, 3D virtual modelling,or simulations using layers of photography to convey urban areas that have potential to be molded. (4)

Aesthetics are an important part of Landscape Detailing,the visual quality of a landscape is what is noticed by others and therefore the goal is to achieving pleasing aesthetic without creating a synthetic feel. Art and design are also qualities that enhance the landscape. Artistic influence has a direct role in planning a landscape.(5)

'''Levelling''' ([[British English]]) or '''leveling''' ([[American English]]); is a branch of [[surveying]], the object of which is to establish or verify or measure the height of specified points relative to a datum. It is widely used in  [[cartography]] to measure [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] [[height]], and in [[construction]] to measure height differences of construction artifacts.

==Optical levelling==
[[Image:Baak.svg|thumb|right|Stadia marks on a crosshair while viewing a metric [[levelling rod]]. The top mark is at 1.5 m and the lower is at 1.345 m. The distance between the marks is 0.155 m, yielding a distance to the rod of 15.5 m.]]Optical levelling  employs an [[optical level]],which consists of a precision telescope with [[crosshair]]s and [[Stadia mark]]s. The cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target, and the stadia allow range-finding; stadia are usually at ratios of 100:1, in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the levelling staff represents 100 metres from the target.
The complete unit is normally mounted on a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]], and the telescope can freely rotate 360° in a horizontal plane. The surveyor adjusts the instrument's level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal. The surveyor does this with the use of a [[Bull's eye level|bull's eye]] [[spirit level|level]] built into the instrument mount.
The surveyor looks through the eyepiece of telescope while an assistant holds a vertical [[Level staff|level staff]] which is a graduated in inches or centimeters. The level staff is placed with its foot on the  point for which the level measurement is required. The telescope is rotated and focused until the level staff is plainly visible in the crosshairs. In the case of a high accuracy manual level, the fine level adjustment is made by an altitude screw, using a high accuracy bubble level fixed to the telescope. This can be viewed by a mirror whilst adjusting or the ends of the bubble can be displayed within the telescope, which also allows assurance of the accurate level of the telescope whilst the sight is being taken. However, in the case of an automatic level, altitude adjustment is done automatically by a suspended prism due to gravity, as long as the coarse levelling is accurate within certain limits. When level, the staff graduation reading at the crosshairs is recorded, and an identifying mark or marker placed where the level staff rested on the object or position being surveyed.

==Linear levelling procedure==
[[File:NivellementExample.svg|thumb|Diagram showing relationship between two level staff, or rods, shown as 1 and 3. The level line of sight is 2.]]

A typical procedure for a linear track of levels from a known datum is as follows. Set up the instrument within {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=off}} of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives the height of the instrument above the starting (backsight) point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the datum to be computed.
The rod is then held on an unknown point and a reading is taken in the same manner, allowing the elevation of the new (foresight) point to be computed. The procedure is repeated until the destination point is reached. It is usual practice to perform either a complete loop back to the starting point or else close the traverse on a second point whose elevation is already known. The closure check guards against blunders in the operation, and allows residual error to be distributed in the most likely manner among the stations.

Some instruments provide three crosshairs which allow [[Stadia mark|stadia]] measurement of the foresight and backsight distances. These also allow use of the average of the three readings (3-wire leveling) as a check against blunders and for averaging out the error of interpolation between marks on the rod scale.

The two main types of levelling are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (Double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two foresights and two backsights and makes sure the difference between the foresights and the difference between the backsights are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ira Osborn Baker|title=Leveling: Barometric, Trigonometric and Spirit|page=126|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22single+leveling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|edition=4th|page=204|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Turning a level===

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. Turning is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location.

To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed.

The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

==Refraction and curvature==
The curvature of the earth means that a line of sight that is horizontal at the instrument will be higher and higher above a spheroid at greater distances. The effect may be significant for some work at distances under 100 meters.

The line of sight is horizontal at the instrument, but is not a straight line because of refraction in the air. The change of air density with elevation causes the line of sight to bend toward the earth.

The combined correction for refraction and curvature is approximately:&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Foote, and Kelly, Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966 p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{meters} = 0.067 D_{km} ^2 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{feet} = 0.021 \left(\frac {D_{ft}}{1000} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; 
For precise work these effects need to be calculated and corrections applied. For most work it is sufficient to keep the foresight and backsight distances approximately equal so that the refraction and curvature effects cancel out. Refraction is generally the greatest source of error in leveling. For short level lines the effects of temperature and pressure are generally insignificant, but the effect of the temperature gradient ''dT / dh'' can lead to errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|place=Oxford | edition=4th | page=222|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levelling loops and gravity variations==

Assuming error-free measurements, if the Earth's gravity field were completely regular and gravity constant, leveling loops would always close precisely:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

around a loop. In the real gravity field of the Earth, this happens only approximately; on small loops typical of engineering projects, the loop closure is negligible, but on larger loops covering regions or continents it is not.

Instead of height differences, ''geopotential differences'' do close around loops:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i g_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; stands for gravity at the leveling interval ''i''. For precise leveling networks on a national scale, the latter formula should always be used.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta W_i = \Delta h_i g_i\ &lt;/math&gt;

should be used in all computations, producing geopotential values &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; for the [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]]s of the network.

===Older instruments===

[[File:SAM PC 1 - Levelling instrument Kern+Co. 1890.jpg|thumb|A "Y" level. The telescope can be removed and reversed or rotated to remove errors.]] The wye level is the oldest and bulkiest of the older style optical instruments. A low-powered telescope is placed in a pair of clamp mounts, and the instrument then leveled using a [[spirit level]], which is mounted parallel to the main telescope.

The [[dumpy level]] was developed by English civil engineer [[William Gravatt]], while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and backsights equal.

Precise level designs were often used for large leveling projects where utmost accuracy was required. They differ from other levels in having a very precise spirit level tube and a micrometer adjustment to raise or lower the line of sight so that the crosshair can be made to coincide with a line on the rod scale and no interpolation is required.

===Automatic level===
Automatic levels make use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.

===Laser level===
{{Main|Laser level}}
Laser levels &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=John S. Scott|title=Dictionary of Civil Engineering|page=252|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=1992|isbn=0-412-98421-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7oIHQDDrxsC&amp;dq=%22laser+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; project a beam which is visible and/or detectable by a sensor on the leveling rod. This style is widely used in construction work but not for more precise control work. An advantage is that one person can perform the levelling independently, whereas other types require one person at the instrument and one holding the rod.

The sensor can be mounted on earth-moving machinery to allow automated grading.

'''Longitude by chronometer''' is a method, in [[navigation]], of determining [[longitude]] using a [[marine chronometer]], which was developed by [[John Harrison]] during the first half of the eighteenth century. It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Principles of Marine Navigation by D A Moore Published by Kandy p89&lt;/ref&gt; In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from [[Greenwich]]) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.

The angle between the sea horizon and the celestial body is measured with a [[sextant]] and the time noted. The Sextant reading is known as the 'Sextant Altitude'. This is corrected by use of tables to a 'True Altitude'. The actual declination and hour angle of the celestial body are found from astronomical tables for the time of the measurement and together with the 'True Altitude' are put into a formula with the assumed latitude. This formula calculates the 'True Hour Angle' which is compared to the assumed longitude providing a correction to the assumed longitude. This correction is applied to the assumed position so that a position line can be drawn through the assumed latitude at the corrected longitude at 90° to the azimuth (bearing) on the celestial body. The observer's position is somewhere along the position line, not necessarily at the found longitude at the assumed latitude. If two or more sights or measurements are taken within a few minutes of each other a 'fix' can be obtained and the observer's position determined as the point where the position lines cross.

The azimuth (bearing) of the celestial body is also determined by use of astronomical tables and for which the time must also be known.

From this, it can be seen that a navigator will need to know the time very accurately so that the position of the observed celestial body is known just as accurately. The position of the sun is given in degrees and minutes north or south of the equational or celestial equator and east or west of Greenwich, established by the English as the Prime Meridian.

The desperate need for an accurate chronometer was finally met in the mid 18th century when an Englishman, [[John Harrison]], produced a series of chronometers that culminated in his celebrated model H-4 that satisfied the requirements for a shipboard standard time-keeper.

Many nations, such as France, have proposed their own reference longitudes as a standard, although the world’s navigators have generally come to accept the reference longitudes tabulated by the British. The reference longitude adopted by the British became known as the [[Prime Meridian]] and is now accepted by most nations as the starting point for all longitude measurements. The Prime Meridian of zero degrees longitude runs along the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England. Longitude is measured east and west from the Prime Meridian. To determine "longitude by chronometer," a navigator requires a chronometer set to the local time at the Prime Meridian. Local time at the Prime Meridian has historically been called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but now, due to international sensitivities, has been renamed as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), and is known colloquially as "zulu time".

==Noon sight for Longitude==

Noon sights obtain the observer's Latitude. It is impossible to determine longitude with an accuracy better than 10nmi by means of a noon sight. A noon sight is called a Meridian Altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Principles of Marine Navigation by D A Moore Published by Kandy p81&lt;/ref&gt; While it is very easy to determine the observer's latitude at noon without knowing the exact time, longitude cannot accurately be measured at noon. At noon the sun's change of altitude is very slow, so determining the exact time that the sun is at its zenith by direct observation is impossible, and therefore it is impossible to obtain an accurate longitude at the moment of Zenith. However, it is possible to determine the time of zenith for longitude with a useful accuracy by performing a mean time of observation when the sun is on its ascent and descent prior to and following its moment of Zenith. By taking a sextant reading within 15 to 30 minutes prior to local noon (zenith) and noting the time, then leaving the sextant set to the same angle and subsequently observing the moment in time at which the sun passes through the sight tube on its descent from Zenith between a half-hour and hour later, the two times can be averaged to obtain a longitude sufficiently accurate for navigation (within 2nmi).&lt;ref&gt;American Practical Navigator (bowditch) by Nathanial Bowditch p253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrections to the process===
Unfortunately, the Earth does not make a perfect circular orbit around the Sun. Due to the elliptical nature of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the speed of the Sun’s apparent orbit around the Earth varies throughout the year and that causes it to appear to speed up and slow down very slightly. Consequently, noon at the Prime Meridian is rarely if ever exactly at 1200 UTC, but rather it occurs some minutes and seconds before or after that time each day. This slight daily variation has been calculated and is listed for each day of the year in the Nautical Almanac under the title of ''[[Equation of time]]''. This variation must be added to or subtracted from the UTC of local apparent noon to improve the accuracy of the calculation. Even with that, other factors, including the difficulty of determining the exact moment of local apparent noon due to the flattening of the Sun’s arc across the sky at its highest point, diminish the accuracy of determining longitude by chronometer as a method of celestial navigation.  Accuracies of less than {{convert|10|nmi|km}} error in position are difficult to achieve using the "longitude by chronometer" method.  Other celestial navigation methods involving more extensive use of both the Nautical Almanac and sight reduction tables are used by navigators to achieve accuracies of one nautical mile (1.9&amp;nbsp;km) or less.

==Time sight==
[[File:TimeSight.png|thumb|340px|Calculating longitude by time sight.]] This only calculates a longitude at the assumed latitude though a position line can be drawn. The observer is somewhere along the position line.
Time sight is a general method for determining longitude by celestial observations using a chronometer; these observations are reduced by solving the [[navigational triangle]] for meridian angle and require known values for altitude, latitude, and declination; the meridian angle is converted to local hour angle and compared with Greenwich hour angle.

If ''Dec'' is the declination of the observed celestial body and Ho is its observed altitude, the local hour angle, ''LHA'', is obtained for a known latitude ''B'' by:

&lt;math&gt;\cos(LHA) = \frac{\sin(Ho) - \sin(Dec) \cdot \sin(B)}{\cos(Dec) \cdot cos(B)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The time sight was a complement to the noon sight or latitude by Polaris in order to obtain a fix.

The '''mile''' is an [[English units of measurement|English unit]] of [[units of length|length]] of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s by [[international yard and pound|international agreement]] in 1959.

With [[qualifier]]s, "mile" is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the [[#Roman mile|Roman&amp;nbsp;mile]], such as the [[#Nautical mile|nautical&amp;nbsp;mile]] (now 1.852&amp;nbsp;km exactly), the [[#Italian mile|Italian&amp;nbsp;mile]] (roughly 1.852&amp;nbsp;km), and the [[li (unit)|Chinese&amp;nbsp;mile]] (now 500&amp;nbsp;m exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 [[roman feet]] but the greater importance of [[furlong]]s in [[Elizabethan era|pre-modern]] [[Kingdom of England|England]] meant that the [[#Statute mile|statute&amp;nbsp;mile]] was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit)|feet]] in 1593. This form of the mile then spread to the [[British Empire|British-colonized nations]] some of which continue to employ the mile. The [[United States Geological Survey|US Geological Survey]] now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its [[North American Datum|1927 geodetic datum]] has meant that a separate [[#U.S. survey mile|US&amp;nbsp;survey&amp;nbsp;mile]] ({{sfrac|6336|3937}}&amp;nbsp;km) continues to see some use. While most countries replaced the mile with the [[kilometre]] when switching to the [[International System of Units]], the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.

The mile was usually [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''m.''' in the past but is now sometimes written as '''mi''' to avoid confusion with the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[metre]]. However, derived units, such as [[miles per hour]] or [[miles per gallon]], continue to be universally abbreviated as '''mph''' and '''mpg''', respectively.

==Name {{anchor|Etymology}}==
The [[modern English]] word ''mile'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|myl}}'' and [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|mīl}}'', which was [[cognate]] with all other [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] terms for "miles". These derived from [[apocope|apocopated]] forms of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mīlia}}'' or ''{{lang|la|mīllia}}'', the plural of ''{{lang|la|mīle}}'' or ''{{lang|la|mīlle}}'',{{refn|group=n|[[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] miles probably derived from [[Middle Low German]], while the terms in [[Romance language]]s developed variously from the singular and plural Latin forms.{{sfnp|OED|2002|loc="mile, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''"}}}} literally "thousand" but used as a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipped]] form of ''{{lang|la|mīlle passus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|passuum}}'', the [[#Roman mile|Roman mile]] of one thousand [[pace (unit)|pace]]s.{{sfnp|OED|2002|loc="mile, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''"}}

The present [[#International mile|international mile]] is usually what is understood by the unqualified term "mile". When this distance needs to be distinguished from the [[#Nautical mile|nautical mile]], the international mile may also be described as a "land mile" or "statute mile".{{sfnp|AHD|2006|loc="mile, 1"}} In [[British English]], the "[[#Statute mile|statute mile]]" may refer to the present international miles or to any other form of [[#English mile|English mile]] since the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#16th century|1593 Act of Parliament]], which set it as a distance of 1,760&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s. Under [[American law]], however, the "statute mile" refers to the [[#U.S. survey mile|US survey mile]].{{sfnp|Thompson|2008|loc=B.6.}} Foreign and historical units translated into English as miles usually employ a [[qualifier]] to describe the kind of mile being used but this may be omitted if it is obvious from the context, such as a discussion of the 2nd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]] describing its distances in terms of "miles" rather than "Roman miles".

The mile has been variously abbreviated—with and without a trailing period—as '''m''', '''M''', '''ml''', and '''mi'''.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now uses and recommends mi in order to avoid confusion with the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[metre]] (m) and [[millilitre]] (ml).{{sfnp|Butcher|2014|p=C-16}} However, derived units such as [[miles per hour]] or [[miles per gallon]] continue to be abbreviated as mph and mpg rather than mi/h and mi/gal. In the United Kingdom [[Road signs in the United Kingdom|road signs]] use '''m''' as the abbreviation for mile though height and width restrictions also use '''m''' as the abbreviation for the metre, which may be displayed alongside feet and inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/307152/draft-tsrgd-schedules.pdf| title=Road traffic: The traffic signs regulations and general directions 2015 | publisher= [[gov.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] style holds that "There is no acceptable abbreviation for 'miles'" and so it should be spelt out when used in describing areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130702112133541 "Numbers"] bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman mile===
The '''[[Roman units|Roman]] mile''' (''{{lang|la|{{linktext|mille passus}}}}'',&lt;!--see talk page--&gt; &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"thousand paces"; &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|abbr.|abbreviated}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''m.p.'''; also ''{{lang|la|milia passuum}}''{{refn|group=n|A [[partitive genitive]] construction literally meaning "one thousand of paces".{{sfnp|Lease|1905|p=211}} }} and ''{{lang|la|mille}}'') consisted of a thousand [[pace (unit)|pace]]s as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times. The [[ancient Roman]]s, marching [[Roman army|their armies]] through uncharted territory, would often push a carved stick in the ground after each 1,000 paces. Well-fed and harshly driven [[Roman legion]]aries in good weather thus created longer miles. The distance was indirectly standardised by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]'s establishment of a standard [[Roman foot]] (Agrippa's own) in 29 BC,{{sfnp|Soren|1999|p=184}} and the definition of a pace as 5&amp;nbsp;feet. An Imperial Roman mile thus denoted 5,000&amp;nbsp;[[Roman feet]]. [[Agrimensor|Surveyors]] and specialized equipment such as the [[decempeda]] and [[dioptra]] then spread its use.{{sfn|Shuttleworth}} In modern times, Agrippa's Imperial Roman mile was empirically estimated to have been about {{convert|1,617|yard|m}} in length.{{sfnp|Smith|1875|p=171}} In [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic areas]] of the Empire, the Roman mile ({{lang-grc-gre|μίλιον}}, ''mílion'') was used beside the native [[Greek units]] as equivalent to 8 [[stadia (unit)|stadia]] of 600 [[Greek feet]]. The ''mílion'' continued to be used as a [[Byzantine units|Byzantine unit]] and was also used as the name of the [[zero mile marker]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Milion]], located at the head of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] near [[Hagia Sophia]].

The Roman mile also spread throughout Europe, with its local variations giving rise to the different units below.

Also arising from the Roman mile is the "milestone". All roads radiated out from the [[Roman Forum]] throughout the Empire – 50,000 miles of stone-paved roads. At every mile was placed a shaped stone, on which was carved a [[Roman numeral]], indicating the number of miles from the center of Rome – the Forum. Hence, one always knew how far one was from Rome.&lt;ref name="AdkinsAdkins2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lesley Adkins|author2=Roy A.

===Italian mile===
The '''[[Italian units|Italian]] mile''' (''{{lang|it|miglio}}'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|pl.|plural}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|it|miglia}}'') was traditionally considered a direct continuation of the Roman mile, equal to 1000 paces,&lt;ref name=demorgan/&gt; although [[Italian units of measurement#Length|its actual value over time or between regions]] could vary greatly.{{sfnp|Zupko|1981|loc="Miglio"}} It was often used in international contexts from the Middle Ages into the 17th century&lt;ref name=demorgan&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TFAwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA231 1].&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus also known as the "geographical mile",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SGwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 2].&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[geographical mile]] is now a separate standard unit.

===Arabic mile===
{{Main|Arabic mile}}

The '''[[Arabic mile]]'''&lt;!-- See talk page. --&gt; ({{lang|ar|الميل}}, ''al-mīl'') was not the common [[Arabic unit]] of [[units of length|length]]; instead, [[Arabs]] and [[Persian people|Persians]] traditionally used the longer [[parasang]] or "Arabic [[league (unit)|league]]". The Arabic mile was, however, used by [[medieval Arab geographers|medieval geographers]] and scientists and constituted a kind of precursor to the [[#Nautical mile|nautical]] or [[geographical mile]]. It extended the Roman mile to fit an [[Arabian astronomy|astronomical]] approximation of 1 [[arcminute]] of [[latitude]] measured directly north-and-south along a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. Although the precise value of the approximation remains disputed, it was somewhere between 1.8 and 2.0&amp;nbsp;km.

===British and Irish miles===

====English mile====
{{see also|yard}}

The "'''old [[English units|English]] mile'''" of the [[medieval England|medieval]] and [[Early Modern England|early modern period]]s varied but seems to have measured about 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[#International mile|international&amp;nbsp;miles]] (1.9&amp;nbsp;km).{{sfnp|Andrews|2003|p=70}} The English long continued the Roman computations of the mile as 5000 [[foot (unit)|feet]], 1000 [[pace (unit)|paces]], or 8 longer divisions, which they equated with their "[[furrow]]'s length" or [[furlong]].{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}}

The origins of English units are "extremely vague and uncertain",{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} but seem to have been a combination of the [[Roman units|Roman system]] with native [[Welsh units|British]] and Germanic systems both derived from multiples of the [[barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]].{{refn|group=n|The {{c.|lk=no|1300}} [[Composition of Yards and Perches]], a [[statutes of uncertain date|statute of uncertain date]] usually reckoned as an enactment of [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]{{sfn|NPL}} or [[Edward II of England|II]],{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} notionally continued to derive English units from three barleycorns "dry and round" to the [[inch]]{{sfn|NPL}} and this statute remained in force until the 1824 [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] establishing the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]]. In practice, official measures were verified using the standards at the Exchequer or simply ignored.{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=37}}}} Probably by the reign of [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] in the 10th century, the nominal [[prototype]] [[standard (metrology)|physical standard]] of English length was an [[arm]]-length [[iron]] bar (a [[yard]]stick) held by the [[kings of England|king]] at [[Winchester]];{{sfn|NPL}}{{sfnp|Chisolm|1864|p=8}} the foot was then one-third of its length. [[Henry I of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;I]] was said to have made a new standard in 1101 based on his own arm.&lt;!--Sic. No nose involved.--&gt;{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} Following the issuance of [[Magna Carta]], the [[baron (UK)|baron]]s of [[English Parliament|Parliament]] directed [[John Lackland|John]] and his son to keep the [[list of English kings|king]]'s standard measure (''{{lang|la|Mensura Domini Regis}}'') and [[Troy pound|weight]] at the [[Exchequer]],{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} which thereafter verified local standards until its abolition in the 19th century. New [[brass]] standards are known to have been constructed under [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]].{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=4}}

Arnold's {{c.|lk=no|1500}} ''Customs of London'' recorded a mile shorter than previous ones, coming to 0.947&amp;nbsp;international&amp;nbsp;miles or 1.524&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}}

{{anchor|Statute mile}} &lt;!--linked from statute mile, land miles, etc. so kindly maintain anchor link.--&gt;
The English '''statute mile''' was established by a [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures]] [[Act of Parliament]] in 1593 during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]]. The act on the [[Composition of Yards and Perches]] had shortened the length of the foot and its associated measures, causing the two methods of determining the mile to diverge.{{sfnp|Zupko|1977|pp=10–11, 20–21}} Owing to the importance of the surveyor's [[rod (unit)|rod]] in deeds and [[surveying]] undertaken under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]],{{sfnp|Burke|1978|loc=Ch.&amp;nbsp;9}} decreasing the length of the rod by {{frac|1|11}} would have amounted to a significant [[land tax|tax]] increase. Parliament instead opted to maintain the mile of 8 [[furlongs]] (which were derived from the rod) and to increase the number of feet per mile from the old Roman value.{{sfnp|Adams|1990}} The applicable passage of the statute reads: "A Mile shall contain eight Furlongs, every Furlong forty Poles,{{refn|group=n|"Pole" being another name for the [[rod (unit)|rod]].}} and every Pole shall contain sixteen Foot and {{not a typo|an}} half."{{refn|Act 35 {{abbr|Eliz.&amp;nbsp;I|Elizabeth I}} {{abbr|cap.|Chapter}} 6, {{abbr|s.|section}} 8.&lt;ref name="statutes at large"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes at large from the first year of King Edward the fourth to the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=29 November 2011|volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;II |year=1763|page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The statute mile therefore contained 5,280&amp;nbsp;feet or 1,760&amp;nbsp;yards.{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}} The distance was not uniformly adopted. [[Robert Morden]] had multiple scales on his 17th-century maps which included continuing local values: his map of [[Hampshire]], for example, bore two different "miles" with a ratio of {{nowrap|1&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.23}}{{sfnp|Norgate|1998}} and his map of [[Dorset]] had three scales with a ratio of {{nowrap|1&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.23&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.41}}.{{sfnp|Morden|1695}} In both cases, the traditional local units remained longer than the statute mile.

====Welsh mile====
The '''[[Welsh units|Welsh]]&amp;nbsp;mile''' (''{{lang|cy|milltir}}'' or ''{{lang|cy|milldir}}'') was 3&amp;nbsp;[[#International mile|mile]]s and 1470&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s long (6.17&amp;nbsp;km). It comprised 9000&amp;nbsp;[[pace (unit)|pace]]s (''{{lang|cy|cam}}''), each of 3&amp;nbsp;[[Welsh feet]] (''{{lang|cy|troedfedd}}'') of 9&amp;nbsp;inches,{{sfnp|Owen|1841|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zYZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90 Book&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;XVII, §5]}} usually reckoned as equivalent to the English inch. Along with other [[Welsh units]], it was said to have been [[Molmutine Laws|codified]] under [[Dyfnwal Moelmud|Dyfnwal the Bald and Silent]] and [[Laws of Hywel Dda|retained unchanged]] by [[Hywel Dda|Hywel the Good]].{{sfnp|Owen|1841|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zYZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 Book&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;XVII, §2]}} Along with other Welsh units, it was discontinued following the [[Edwardian Conquest of Wales|conquest]] of [[Principality of Wales|Wales]] by the English under [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]] in the 13th century.

====Scots mile====
[[File:Edinburgh High Street.JPG|thumb|[[Edinburgh]]'s "[[Royal Mile]]"—running from [[Edinburgh Castle|the castle]] to [[Holyrood Abbey]]—is roughly a Scots mile&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Edinburgh 2000 visitors' guide|publisher=Collins|year=1999|page=31|isbn=978-0-004-49017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''[[Scots units|Scots]] mile''' was longer than the English mile,&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=mile |title= [[Dictionary of the Scottish Language]] – [[Scottish National Dictionary]] |chapterurl=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=1982&amp;startset=25361793&amp;query=MILE&amp;fhit=mile&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd#fhit }}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned by [[Robert Burns]] in the first verse of his poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]". It comprised 8&amp;nbsp;(Scots)&amp;nbsp;furlongs divided into 320&amp;nbsp;[[fall (Scots)|fall]]s or faws (Scots [[rod (unit)|rod]]s).&lt;ref name="DOST"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=fall, faw |title=Dictionary of the Scottish Language – [[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]] |chapterurl=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=fall&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It varied from place to place but the most accepted equivalencies are 1,976&amp;nbsp;[[Imperial system|Imperial]]&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s (1.123 [[statute mile]]s or 1.81&amp;nbsp;km).

It was legally abolished three times: first by a 1685 act of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]],&lt;ref name="1685-4-83"&gt;"[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/83 Act for a standard of miles]" (June 16, 1685). ''APS'' '''viii''': 494, c.59. ''[[Records of the Parliaments of Scotland|RPS]]'' 1685/4/83.&lt;/ref&gt; again by the 1707 [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1706/10/257 Union with England Act 1707 (c.&amp;nbsp;7)], art.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]].&lt;ref name="SNL" /&gt; It had continued in use as a customary unit through the 18th century but had become obsolete by its final abolition.

====Irish mile====
{{Main|Irish mile}}

The '''Irish mile''' (''{{lang|ga|míle}}'' or ''{{lang|ga|míle Gaelach}}'') measured 2240 yards: approximately 1.27 statute miles or 2.048 kilometres.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc=[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictI.html "Irish mile"]}}&lt;ref name=OSIfaq&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx#faq7 |accessdate=February 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228155031/http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx |archivedate=February 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in Ireland from the [[Plantations of Ireland|16th century plantations]] until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on "[[Imperial measure|English measure]]" but used a [[linear perch]] measuring {{convert|7|yard|metre}} as opposed to the English [[Rod (unit)|rod]] of {{convert|5.5|yard|metre}}.&lt;ref name=OSIfaq /&gt;

* The '''Dutch mile''' (''{{lang|nl|Mijl}}'') has had different definitions throughout history. One of the older definitions was 5600 [[ell]]s. But the length of an ell was not standardised, so that the length of a mile could range between 3280&amp;nbsp;m and 4280&amp;nbsp;m. The Dutch mile also has had historical definitions of one hour's walking (''{{lang|nl|Uur gaans}}''), which meant around 5&amp;nbsp;km, or 20,000 Amsterdam or Rhineland feet (respectively 5660&amp;nbsp;m or 6280&amp;nbsp;m). Besides the common Dutch mile, there is also the geographical mile. 15 geographical Dutch miles equal one degree of [[longitude]] on the [[equator]]. Its value changed as the circumference of the earth was estimated to a better precision. But at the time of usage, it was around 7157&amp;nbsp;m. The metric system was introduced in the Netherlands in 1816, and the metric mile became a synonym for the kilometer, being exactly 1000&amp;nbsp;m. Since 1870, the term "mile" was replaced by the equivalent "kilometer". Today, the word "mile" is no longer used, apart from some old proverbs.
{{anchor|German mile|Austrian mile|Danish mile}}
* The '''German mile''' (''{{lang|de|Meile}}'') was 24,000 German feet. The standardised '''Austrian mile''' used in southern Germany and the [[Austrian Empire]] was 7.586&amp;nbsp;km; the '''Prussian mile''' used in northern Germany was 7.5325&amp;nbsp;km. Following its standardisation by [[Ole Rømer]] in the late 17th century, the '''Danish mile''' (''{{lang|da|mil}}'') was precisely equal to the Prussian mile and likewise divided into 24,000 feet.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}} These were sometimes treated as equivalent to 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. Earlier values had varied: the ''Sjællandske miil'', for instance, had been 11.13&amp;nbsp;km. The Germans also used a longer version of the [[#Geographical mile|geographical mile]].
* The '''Saxon Post mile''' (''{{lang|de|kursächsische Postmeile}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Polizeimeile}}'', introduced on occasion of a survey of the Saxon roads in the 1700s, corresponded to 2000 Dresden [[rod (unit)|rods]], equivalent to 9.062 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poststrassen-erleben.de/geschichten/historie-der-postsaeulen.html | title = Historie der Postsäulen | publisher = Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.V. und 1.

* The '''[[Croatian mile]]''' (''{{lang|hr|hrvatska milja}}''), first devised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Stjepan Glavač]] on a 1673 map, is the length of an arc of the equator subtended by {{sfrac|10}}° or 11.13&amp;nbsp;km exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://public.carnet.hr/zuh/do1874/nv17/nv17_11.htm "Centuries of Natural Science in Croatia : Theory and Application"].

* The '''[[Ottoman units of measurement|Ottoman mile]]''' was 1,894.35 m (1.17709&amp;nbsp;mi), which was equal to 5,000 Ottoman foot. After 1933, the Ottoman mile was replaced with the modern Turkish mile (1,853.181&amp;nbsp;m).
{{clear}}

==International mile==
The '''international mile''' is precisely equal to '''{{val|1.609344|u=km}}''' (or {{sfrac|25146|15625}}&amp;nbsp;km as a fraction).{{refn|1,760&amp;nbsp;yards&amp;nbsp;× 0.9144 m/yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72/schedules |title=Weights &amp; Measures Act of 1985 |contribution=Schedule&amp;nbsp;I, Part&amp;nbsp;VI }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was established as part of the 1959 [[international yard and pound]] agreement reached by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and [[South Africa]],{{sfnp|Barbrow|1976|pp=16–17, 20}} which resolved small but measurable differences that had arisen from separate physical standards each country had maintained for the yard.{{sfnp|Bigg|1964}} As with the earlier [[#Statute mile|statute mile]], it continues to comprise 1,760 yards or 5,280 feet.

The old Imperial value of the yard was used in converting measurements to metric values in India in a 1976 Act of the Indian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091112174359/http://202.54.104.236/intranet/eip/legislation/uploads/THE%20STANDARDS%20OF%20WEIGHTS%20AND%20MEASURES%20ACT%201976.pdf Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current National Topographic Database of the [[Survey of India]] is based on the metric [[WGS-84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Survey of India]], "[http://www.surveyofindia.gov.in/tenders/nationalmappolicy/nationalmappolicy.pdf National Map Policy&amp;nbsp;– 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331035549/http://www.surveyofindia.gov.in/tenders/nationalmappolicy/nationalmappolicy.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used by the [[Global Positioning System]].

The difference from the previous standards was 2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]], or about 3.2&amp;nbsp;millimeters ({{frac|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch) per mile. The U.S. standard was slightly longer and the old Imperial standards had been slightly shorter than the international mile. When the international mile was introduced in English-speaking countries, the basic [[geodetic datum]] in America was the [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD27). This had been constructed by [[triangulation]] based on the definition of the foot in the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, with 1&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1200|3937}}&amp;nbsp;metres and the definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the ''U.S. survey foot'' to distinguish it from the international foot.{{sfnp|Astin|1959}}&lt;ref group="n"&gt;When reading the document it helps to bear in mind that 999,998 = 3,937 × 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking countries until the [[international yard and pound]] agreement in 1959 established the yard as exactly 0.9144&amp;nbsp;metres, giving a mile exactly 1,609.344&amp;nbsp;metres. The U.S. adopted this international mile for most purposes, but retained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the ''U. S. survey mile''. In the United States, ''statute mile'' normally refers to the survey mile,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convertunits.com/from/mile+%5Bstatute%5D/to/mile+%5Bstatute,+US%5D Convert mile &amp;#91;statute&amp;#93; to mile &amp;#91;statute, US&amp;#93;] "1 metre is equal to {{val|0.000621371192237}} mile [statute], or {{val|0.000621369949495}} mile [statute, US]. ... The U.S. statute mile (or survey mile) is defined by the survey foot. This is different from the international statute mile, which is defined as exactly 1609.344 meters. The U.S. statute mile is defined as 5,280 U.S. survey feet, which is around {{val|1609.347219}} meters."&lt;/ref&gt; about 3.219&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch) longer than the international mile (the international mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the U.S. survey mile).

While most countries replaced the mile with the [[kilometre]] when switching to the [[International System of Units]], the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as [[Liberia]], [[Myanmar]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Naypyitaw Tollbooth.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite legislation UK | type = si | year = 1995 | number = 1804 | si = The Units of Measurement Regulations 1995 |url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1804/made?view=plain}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/laws/speedlimits.aspx Maximum posted speed limits] (US) IIHS.

Canadian railways have not been metricated and therefore continue to measure trackage in miles and speed in miles per hour.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hastingspark.com/racing/factbook.aspx Hastings Racecourse Fact Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172501/http://www.hastingspark.com/racing/factbook.aspx |date=2012-04-18 }} Like Canadian railways, Canadian race tracks etc, have not been metricated and continue to measure distance in miles, furlongs, and yards (see page 18 of the fact book).&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. survey mile==
The ''U.S. survey mile'' is 5,280 survey feet, or about 1,609.347&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/document-2382].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ''statute mile'' formally refers to the survey mile,{{sfnp|Thompson|2008|loc=B.6.}} but for most purposes, the difference between the survey mile and the international mile is insignificant—one international mile is {{val|0.999998}} U.S. survey miles—so ''statute mile'' can be used for either. But in some cases, such as in the U.S. [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles,&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title = What are the 'official' conversions that are used by NGS to convert 1) metres to inches, and 2) metres to feet? | url = http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#Feet | id = Frequently Asked Questions about the National Geodetic Survey | author =U.S. National Geodetic Survey| accessdate = May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accumulated difference ''can be'' significant, so it is important to note that the reference is to the U.S. survey mile.

The United States redefined its yard in 1893, but this resulted in U.S. and Imperial measures of distance having very slightly different lengths.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which replaced the NAD27, is defined in meters. State Plane Coordinate Systems were then updated, but the [[National Geodetic Survey]] left individual states to decide which (if any) definition of the foot they would use. All State Plane Coordinate Systems are defined in meters, and 42 of the 50 states only use the metre-based State Plane Coordinate Systems. However, eight states also have State Plane Coordinate Systems defined in feet, seven of them in U.S. Survey feet and one in international feet.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

State legislation in the U.S. is important for determining which conversion factor from the metric datum is to be used for land surveying and real estate transactions, even though the difference (2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) is hardly significant, given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures be based on the U.S. survey foot, eight have legislated that they be based on the international foot, and eighteen have not specified which conversion factor to use.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

==Nautical mile==
[[File:RechtwKugeldreieck.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|'''On the utility of the nautical mile.'''&lt;br&gt;Each circle shown is a [[great circle]]—the analog of a line in spherical trigonometry—and hence the shortest path connecting two points on the globular surface. [[Meridian (geography)|Meridians]] are great circles that pass through the poles.]]
{{Main|Nautical mile}}

The ''nautical mile'' was originally defined as one [[minute of arc]] along a [[Meridian arc|meridian]] of the Earth.{{sfnp|Maloney|1978|p=34}} Navigators use dividers to step off the distance between two points on the navigational chart, then place the open dividers against the minutes-of-latitude scale at the edge of the chart, and read off the distance in nautical miles.{{sfnp|Maloney|1978|pp=34–35}} The Earth is not perfectly spherical but an [[oblate spheroid]], so the length of a minute of latitude increases by 1% from the equator to the poles. Using the [[World Geodetic System|WGS84 ellipsoid]], the commonly accepted Earth model for many purposes today, one minute of latitude at the WGS84 equator is 6,046 feet and at the poles is 6,107.5 feet. The average is about 6,076 feet (about 1,852 metres or 1.15 statute miles).

In the United States, the nautical mile was defined in the 19th century as 6,080.2&amp;nbsp;feet (1,853.249&amp;nbsp;m), whereas in the United Kingdom, the ''Admiralty nautical mile'' was defined as 6,080&amp;nbsp;feet (1,853.184&amp;nbsp;m) and was about one minute of latitude in the latitudes of the south of the UK. Other nations had different definitions of the nautical mile, but it is now internationally defined to be exactly {{convert|1,852|m|ft|8|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related nautical units===
The nautical mile per hour is known as the [[Knot (unit)|knot]]. Nautical miles and knots are almost universally used for aeronautical and maritime navigation, because of their relationship with degrees and minutes of latitude and the convenience of using the latitude scale on a map for distance measuring.

The [[data mile]] is used in [[radar]]-related subjects and is equal to 6,000 feet (1.8288 kilometres).{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="data mile"}} The [[radar mile]] is a unit of time (in the same way that the [[light year]] is a unit of distance), equal to the time required for a radar pulse to travel a distance of two miles (one mile each way). Thus, the radar statute mile is 10.8&amp;nbsp;μs and the radar nautical mile is 12.4&amp;nbsp;μs.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="radar mile"}}

==Geographical mile==
{{Main|Geographical mile}}

The [[geographical mile]] is based upon the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[latitude]]. The German geographical mile ({{lang|de|geographische Meile}}) was previously {{frac|15}}° of latitude (7.4127&amp;nbsp;km).{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="meile"}}

==Grid system==
[[Cities]] in the continental United States often have [[street]]s laid out by miles. [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Chicago]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Miami]], are several examples. Typically the largest streets are about a mile apart, with others at smaller intervals. In the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City "streets" are close to 20 per mile, while the major numbered "avenues" are about six per mile. (Centerline to centerline, 42nd Street to 22nd Street is supposed to be 5250 feet while 42nd Street to 62nd Street is supposed to be {{clarify|date=May 2014}} 5276&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in.){{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Metric mile==
{{Main|Metric mile}}

The informal term "[[metric mile]]" is used in sports such as [[track and field athletics]] and [[speed skating]] to denote a distance of {{convert|1500|metres|feet|0}}. In United States high-school competition, the term is sometimes used for a race of {{convert|1600|metres|feet|0}}.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mile"}}

==Scandinavian mile==
{{Main|Scandinavian mile}}

The '''[[Scandinavian mile]]''' (''{{lang|no|mil}}'') remains in common use in Norway and Sweden, where it has meant precisely 10&amp;nbsp;km since metrication occurred in 1889.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}} It is used in informal situations and in measurements of fuel consumption, which are often given as litres per ''{{lang|no|mil}}''. In formal situations (such as official road signs) and where confusion may occur with [[#International mile|international mile]]s, it is avoided in favour of kilometres.

The '''Swedish&amp;nbsp;mile''' was standardised as 36,000 Swedish feet or 10.687&amp;nbsp;km in 1649; before that it varied by [[provinces of Sweden|province]] from about 6 to 14.485&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}}

Before metrication, the '''Norwegian&amp;nbsp;mile''' was 11.298&amp;nbsp;km.

The traditional Finnish ''{{lang|fi|peninkulma}}'' was translated as ''{{lang|sv|mil}}'' in Swedish and also set equal to 10&amp;nbsp;km during metrication in 1887, but is much less commonly used.

==Comparison table==
A comparison of the different lengths for a "mile", in different countries and at different times in history, is given in the table below. [[League (unit)|League]]s are also included in this list because, in terms of length, they fall in between the short West European miles and the long North, Central and Eastern European miles.

==Idioms==
Even in English-speaking countries that have moved from the Imperial to the metric system (for example, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand), the mile is still used in a variety of [[idioms]]. These include:
* A ''[[wikt:country mile|country mile]]'' is used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] to denote a very long distance.
* ''"A miss is as good as a mile"'' (failure by a narrow margin is no better than any other failure)
* ''"Give him an inch and he'll take a mile"''&amp;nbsp;– a corruption of ''"Give him an inch and he'll take an [[ell]]"''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (5th edition; 1964).

* ''"Missed by a mile"'' (missed by a wide margin)
* ''"Go a mile a minute"'' (move very quickly)
* ''"Talk a mile a minute"'' (speak at a rapid rate)
* ''"To go the extra mile"'' (to put in extra effort)
* ''"Miles away"'' (lost in thought, or daydreaming)

[[File:Monasterio Khor Virap, Armenia, 2016-10-01, DD 25.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Mount Ararat]], as seen from [[Armenia]].]]

A '''mountain''' is a large [[landform]] that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.&lt;ref name="FOOTNOTEGerrard1990"/&gt; A mountain is generally steeper than a [[hill]]. [[Mountain formation|Mountains are formed]] through [[tectonic plate|tectonic forces]] or [[volcanism]]. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of [[river]]s, [[weathering|weather conditions]], and [[glacier]]s. A few mountains are isolated [[summit (topography)|summit]]s, but most occur in huge [[mountain range]]s.

High elevations on mountains produce [[alpine climate|colder climates]] than at [[sea level]]. These colder climates strongly affect the [[ecosystem]]s of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as [[mountain climbing]].

The highest mountain on [[Earth]] is [[Mount Everest]] in the [[Himalayas]] of [[Asia]], whose summit is {{convert|8850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above [[mean sea level]]. The [[List of tallest mountains in the Solar System|highest known mountain]] on any planet in the [[Solar System]] is [[Olympus Mons]] on [[Mars]] at {{convert|21171|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

==Definition==
[[File:Batian Nelion and pt Slade in the foreground Mt Kenya.JPG|thumb|Peaks of [[Mount Kenya]]]]
[[File:Mount Wilhelm.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Wilhelm]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]]]
There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain.{{sfn|Gerrard|1990}} In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."{{sfn|Gerrard|1990}}

Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. [[Mount Scott (Oklahoma)|Mount Scott]] outside [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] is only {{convert|251|m|abbr=on}} from its base to its highest point. Whittow's ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''&lt;ref name="whittow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittow |first=John |year=1984 |title=Dictionary of Physical Geography |location=London |publisher=Penguin |page=352 |isbn=0-14-051094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; states ''"Some authorities regard eminences above {{convert|600|m|ft}} as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."''

In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nuttall |first=John &amp; Anne |work=The Mountains of England &amp; Wales |volume=2 |title=England |edition=3rd |year=2008 |publisher=Cicerone |location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria |isbn=1-85284-037-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7623904.stm|title=Survey turns hill into a mountain|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002232825/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7623904.stm|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G4AW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.go4awalk.com/uk-mountains-and-hills/a-mountain-is-a-mountain.php|title=A Mountain is a Mountain – isn't it?|publisher=www.go4awalk.com|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208122551/http://www.go4awalk.com/uk-mountains-and-hills/a-mountain-is-a-mountain.php|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mountain|title=mountain|work=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205033435/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mountain|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Peter |year=2001 |title=Listing the Irish hills and mountains |journal=Irish Geography |volume=34 |issue=1 |publisher=University of Ulster |location=Coleraine |page=89 |url=http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/34-1/hills.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HgLY5lsv?url=http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/34-1/hills.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-27 |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/00750770109555778}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the official UK government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metricviews.org.uk/2008/09/what-is-a-mountain-mynydd-graig-goch-and-all-that/ |title=What is a "Mountain"?

Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallery.usgs.gov/audios/127|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN4f0RjB?url=http://gallery.usgs.gov/audios/127|archivedate=2013-02-12|title=What is the difference between lake and pond; mountain and hill; or river and creek?|publisher=USGS|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN Environmental Programme]]'s definition of "mountainous environment" includes any of the following:{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002|p=74}}
*Elevation of at least {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}};
*Elevation of at least {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a slope greater than 2 degrees;
*Elevation of at least {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a slope greater than 5 degrees;
*Elevation of at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} elevation range within {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

{{Main|Mountain formation|List of mountain types}}
There are three main types of mountains: [[volcano|volcanic]], [[fold mountain|fold]], and [[fault-block mountain|block]].&lt;ref name=literacy&gt;{{cite book |title=Science matters: earth and beyond; module 4 |isbn=0-7986-6059-7 |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson South Africa |chapter=Chapter 6: Mountain building |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZftjymxFsC&amp;pg=PA75 |page=75 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509141011/https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZftjymxFsC&amp;pg=PA75 |archivedate=9 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three types are formed from [[plate tectonics]]: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, [[isostasy|isostatic]] [[Orogeny|uplift]] and intrusion of [[igneous rock|igneous matter]] forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.

===Volcanoes===
{{Main|Volcano}}
[[File:Geologycal cross-section of Fuji.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Geological cross-section of [[Mount Fuji|Fuji volcano]]]]
Volcanoes are formed when [[subduction|a plate is pushed below another plate]], or at a [[mid-ocean ridge]] or [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]].&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;{{cite book |title=Science of Earth Systems |first=Stephen D |last=Butz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB4ArbvXXDEC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136 |chapter=Chapter 8: Plate tectonics |isbn=0-7668-3391-7 |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson/Delmar Learning |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507024603/https://books.google.com/books?id=JB4ArbvXXDEC&amp;pg=PA136 |archivedate=7 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a depth of around 100&amp;nbsp;km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms [[magma]] that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a [[shield volcano]] or a [[stratovolcano]].{{sfn|Gerrard|1990|p=194}} Examples of volcanoes include [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan and [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form [[dome mountain]]s, such as [[Navajo Mountain]] in the US.

===Fold mountains===
[[File:Lewis overthrust fault nh10f.jpg|thumb|Illustration of mountains that developed on a [[fold (geology)|fold]] that thrusted.]]
{{Main|Fold mountains}}
Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.&lt;ref name=Hatcher&gt;{{cite book |title=4-D framework of continental crust |editor=Robert D. Hatcher Jr. |editor2=MP Carlson |editor3=JH McBride |editor4=JR Martinez Catalán |first=Michael P |last=Searle |page=41 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jD-zXhTfJuMC&amp;pg=PA41 |chapter=Diagnostic features and processes in the construction and evolution of Oman-, Zagros-, Himalayan-, Karakoram-, and Tibetan type orogenic belts |isbn=0-8137-1200-9 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624055425/https://books.google.com/books?id=jD-zXhTfJuMC&amp;pg=PA41 |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the less dense [[continental crust]] "floats" on the denser [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, [[plateau]]s or mountains must be [[isostasy|balanced by the buoyancy force]] of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Press |first1=Frank |last2=Siever |first2=Raymond |title=Earth |publisher=W. H. Freeman |edition=4th |year=1985 |page=413 |isbn=978-0-7167-1743-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock can [[fold (geology)|fold]] either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are [[anticline]]s and the downfolds are [[syncline]]s: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The [[Jura Mountains]] are an example of fold mountains.

===Block mountains===
{{Main|Block mountains}}
[[File:Slide Mountain Catskills.jpg|thumb|The [[Catskills]] in [[Upstate New York]] represent an eroded [[plateau]].]]
Block mountains are caused by [[fault (geology)|faults]] in the crust: a plane where rocks have moved past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite book |title=CliffsQuickReview Earth Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV_BabxTTkcC&amp;pg=PA94 |chapter=Figure 13-1 |first=Scott |last=Ryan |isbn=0-471-78937-2 |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430170013/https://books.google.com/books?id=PV_BabxTTkcC&amp;pg=PA94 |archivedate=30 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The uplifted blocks are block mountains or [[Horst (geology)|horsts]]. The intervening dropped blocks are termed [[graben]]: these can be small or form extensive [[rift valley]] systems. This form of [[landscape]] can be seen in [[East Africa]], the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]], the [[Basin and Range Province]] of Western [[North America]] and the [[Rhine graben|Rhine]] valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the [[crust (geology)|crust]] is thinned.

===Erosion===
{{Main|Erosion}}
[[File:Kitty Ann Mountain.jpg|alt=1259 ft|thumb|[[Kitty Ann Mountain]] is an [[Erosion|eroded mountain]] in the [[Ramapo Mountains|Ramapo mountain range]] in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]]]
During and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of [[erosion]] (water, wind, ice, and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves.{{sfn|Fraknoi|Morrison|Wolff|2004|p=160}} [[Glacier|Glacial processes]] produce characteristic landforms, such as [[pyramidal peak]]s, knife-edge [[arête]]s, and bowl-shaped [[cirque]]s that can contain lakes. [[Plateau]] mountains, such as the [[Catskills]], are formed  from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.

In [[earth science]], ''erosion'' is the action of surface processes (such as [[Surface runoff|water flow]] or [[wind]]) that removes [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]], or dissolved material from one location on the [[Earth's crust#Crust|Earth's crust]], and then [[Sediment transport|transport]] it away to another location (not to be confused with [[weathering]] which involves no movement). The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into [[clastic]] [[sediment]] is referred to as ''physical'' or ''mechanical'' erosion; this contrasts with ''chemical'' erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded [[sediment]] or solutes may be transported just a few millimeters, or for thousands of kilometers.

==Climate==
{{Main|Alpine climate}}
[[File:Ural_mountains_3_448122223_93fa978a6d_b.jpg|thumb|A combination of high latitude and high altitude makes the [[Ural Mountains|northern Urals]] in picture to have climatic conditions that make the ground barren.]]
Climate in the mountains becomes colder at high [[elevation]]s, due to an interaction between [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. Sunlight in the [[visible spectrum]] hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If [[radiation]] were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the [[greenhouse effect]] of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly {{convert|333|K|C F}}, and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard M. |last1=Goody |first2=James C.G. |last2=Walker |title=Atmospheres |chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures |chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1972 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729075851/http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of [[convection]]. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an [[adiabatic process]], which has a characteristic pressure-temperature dependence. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the [[adiabatic lapse rate]], which is approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer (or 5.4&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet) of altitude.&lt;ref name=goodywilson/&gt;

Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent [[heat of vaporization]]. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes [[Dew point|saturated]] and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming [[cloud]]s), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the [[dry adiabatic lapse rate]] to the [[moist adiabatic lapse rate]] (5.5&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer or 3&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |title=Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate |publisher=tpub.com |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603041448/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |archivedate=3 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.

Therefore, moving up 100&amp;nbsp;meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80&amp;nbsp;kilometers (45&amp;nbsp;miles or 0.75° of [[latitude]]) towards the nearest pole.{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002|p=15}} This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to [[ocean]]s (such as the [[Arctic Ocean]]) can drastically modify the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The effect of the climate on the ecology at an elevation can be largely captured through a combination of amount of precipitation, and the [[Holdridge life zones|biotemperature]], as described by [[Leslie Holdridge]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN4ZYhX6?url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm |archivedate=2013-02-12 |last1=Lugo |first1=Ariel E. |first2=Sandra L. |last2=Brown |first3=Rusty |last3=Dodson |first4=Tom S. |last4=Smith |first5=Hank H. |last5=Shugart |year=1999 |title=The Holdridge Life Zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=26 |pages=1025–1038 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotemperature is the mean temperature; all temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} are considered to be 0&amp;nbsp;°C. When the temperature is below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, plants are [[dormancy|dormant]], so the exact temperature is unimportant. The peaks of mountains with permanent snow can have a biotemperature below {{convert|1.5|C|F}}.

==Ecology==
{{Main|Montane ecology}}
[[File:GlarusAlps.jpg|thumb|An alpine [[Bog|mire]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]]]
The colder climate on mountains affects the plants and animals residing on mountains. A particular set of plants and animals tend to be adapted to a relatively narrow range of climate. Thus, ecosystems tend to lie along elevation bands of roughly constant climate. This is called [[altitudinal zonation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daubenmire |first=R.F. |date=June 1943 |title=Vegetational Zonation in the Rocky Mountains |journal=Botanical Review |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=325–393 |url= |doi=10.1007/BF02872481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In regions with dry climates, the tendency of mountains to have higher precipitation as well as lower temperatures also provides for varying conditions, which enhances zonation.{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002}}&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotic Communities of the Colorado Plateau: C. Hart Merriam and the Life Zones Concept|url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/merriam.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EBRUtV6A?url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/merriam.htm|archivedate=2013-02-04|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plants and animals found in altitudinal zones tend to become isolated since the conditions above and below a particular zone will be inhospitable and thus constrain their movements or [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]]. These isolated ecological systems are known as [[sky island]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweit |first=Susan J. |title=The Great Southwest Nature Factbook |publisher=[[Alaska Northwest Books]] |year=1992 |pages=209–210 |isbn=0-88240-434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altitudinal zones tend to follow a typical pattern. At the highest elevations, trees cannot grow, and whatever life may be present will be of the [[Alpine climate|alpine]] type, resembling [[tundra]].&lt;ref name="Merriam"/&gt; Just below the [[tree line]], one may find [[subalpine]] forests of [[Pinophyta|needleleaf]] trees, which can withstand cold, dry conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Tree|encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003| publisher=Microsoft Corporation|origyear=1993|year=2002|id=60210-442-1635445-74407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below that, [[montane forest]]s grow. In the temperate portions of the earth, those forests tend to be needleleaf trees, while in the tropics, they can be [[broadleaf]] trees growing in a [[rain forest]].

===Mountain societies and economies===
Mountains are generally less preferable for [[human]] habitation than lowlands, because of harsh weather and little level ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. While 7% of the land area of Earth is above {{convert|2500|m|ft}},{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002|p=14}} only 140 million people live above that altitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human Genetic Adaptation to High Altitude |first=Lorna G. |last=Moore |journal=High Alt Med Biol |year=2001 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=257–279 |doi=10.1089/152702901750265341 |pmid=11443005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only 20-30 million people above {{convert|3000|m|ft}} elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/106/4/1441.long |title=The influence of high-altitude living on body iron |first1=James D. |last1=Cook |first2=Erick |last2=Boy |first3=Carol |last3=Flowers |first4=Maria |last4=del Carmen Daroca |journal=Blood |year=2005 |volume=106 |pages=1441–1446 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-12-4782 |issue=4 |pmid=15870179}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of mountain dwellers live in the [[Andes]], [[Central Asia]], and Africa.&lt;ref name=panos/&gt;

Traditional mountain societies rely on agriculture, with higher risk of [[crop failure]] than at lower elevations. Minerals often occur in mountains, with [[mining]] being an important component of the economics of some montane societies. More recently, [[tourism]] supports mountain communities, with some intensive development around attractions such as [[national park]]s or [[ski resorts]].{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002|p=17}} About 80% of mountain people live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name=panos/&gt;

Most of the world's [[river]]s are fed from mountain sources, with snow acting as a storage mechanism for downstream users.{{sfn|Blyth|Groombridge|Lysenko|Miles|2002|p=22}} More than half of humanity depends on mountains for water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wateryear2003.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3903&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007104411/http://www.wateryear2003.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D3903%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate=7 October 2006 |title=International Year of Freshwater 2003 |accessdate=7 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain.org/mountains/whymtns.cfm?slidepage=water|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709060421/http://www.mountain.org/mountains/whymtns.cfm?slidepage=water|archivedate=9 July 2006|title=The Mountain Institute|accessdate=7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mountaneering===
[[File:M Rainier.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountain climbers ascending [[Mount Rainier]]]]
[[Mountaineering]], mountain climbing, or alpinism is the [[sport]], [[hobby]] or [[profession]] of hiking, skiing, and climbing mountains. While mountaineering began as attempts to reach the highest point of unclimbed big mountains it has branched into specializations that address different aspects of the mountain and consists of three areas: rock-craft, snow-craft and skiing, depending on whether the route chosen is over [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[snow]] or [[ice]]. All require experience, athletic ability, and technical knowledge to maintain safety.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor1-last= Cox|editor1-first= Steven M.|editor2-first= Kris| editor2-last=Fulsaas | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | origyear = 2003 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest mountains are not generally the most voluminous. [[Mauna Loa]] ({{convert|4169|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2|-2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and volume (about {{convert|18000|mi3|km3|-3|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Kaye |first=G.D. |title=Using GIS to estimate the total volume of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34712.htm |booktitle=98th Annual Meeting |conference=Geological Society of America |year=2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125194545/http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34712.htm |archivedate=25 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area ({{convert|245|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and volume ({{convert|1150|mi3|km3|0|abbr=on||disp=or}}).  [[Mount Logan]] is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area ({{convert|120|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the [[figure of the Earth]] is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several miles farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]], [[Ecuador]]'s tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of [[Peru]]'s tallest mountain, [[Huascarán]], is another contender.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Position fixing''' is the branch of [[navigation]] concerned with the use of a variety of visual and [[Electronics|electronic]] methods to determine the position of a [[vehicle]] or person on the surface of the [[Earth]].

These techniques include:

* [[Position line]]s and [[position circle]]s
* [[Celestial navigation]]
* [[Radio navigation]]
* [[Satellite navigation system]]

Positions may be expressed as a bearing and range from a known landmark  or as an [[angle]]s of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] relative to a [[map datum]].

Generally speaking a position fix is calculated by taking into account measurements (referred to as observations) of distances or angles to reference points whose positions are known. In 2D surveys observations of three reference points are enough to compute a position in a [[two dimensional]] plane. In practice observations are subject to errors resulting from various physical and atmospheric factors that influence the measurement of distances and angles.

A practical example of obtaining a position fix would be for a ship to take [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] measurements on three [[lighthouse]]s positioned along the coast. These measurements could be made visually using a [[Hand compass|hand bearing compass]], or in poor visibility electronically using [[radar]] or [[Direction finding|radio direction finding]]. Since all physical observations are subject to errors the resulting position fix is also subject to error. Although in theory two lines of position (LOP) are enough to define a point, in practice 'crossing' more LOPs provides greater accuracy and confidence, especially if the lines cross at a good angle to each other. Three LOPs are considered the minimum for a practical navigational fix. The three LOPs when drawn on the chart will in general form a triangle, known as a 'cocked hat'. The navigator will have more confidence in a position fix that is formed by a small cocked hat with angles close to those of an [[equilateral triangle]]. 

It is not true to say that the navigator's true position is 'definitely' within the cocked hat on the chart. The area of doubt surrounding a position fix is called an error ellipse. To minimize the error, [[Satellite navigation|electronic navigation]] systems generally use more than three reference points to compute a position fix to increase the [[data redundancy]]. As more redundant reference points are added the position fix becomes more accurate and the area of the resulting error ellipse decreases.

The process of combining multiple observations to compute a position fix is equivalent to solving a system of [[linear equations]].  Navigation systems use regression [[algorithms]] such as [[Least squares]] in order to compute a position fix in 3D space. This is most commonly done by combining distance measurements to 4 or more [[GPS]] [[satellites]], which orbit the earth along paths of predetermined position.

'''Precise Point Positioning''' (PPP) is a [[Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) [[GNSS positioning calculation|positioning method to calculate]] very precise positions up to few centimeter level using a single (GNSS) receiver in a dynamic and global reference framework like [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS). PPP methods are different from ([[Differential GPS|DGNSS]]) positioning methods which differentiate errors using one or more reference stations with known positions. The PPP approach combines precise clocks and orbits, so-called precise ephemeris,  calculated from a global network to calculate a precise position with a single receiver, which can be double or single frequency.

Historically precise positioning was associated with [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]]. It makes use of carrier-phase observables, allowing positioning precisions of a fraction of a carrier wavelength, 19 or 24 cm. It also makes use of precise ephemeris, generated by the geodetic community -- the IGS, [http://www.igs.org/ International GNSS Service] -- from measurements by a global network of tracking stations. Recently, the dissemination over the Internet in low-latency real time -- e.g., [http://apps.gdgps.net/ APPS], the Automatic Precise Positioning Service of NASA JPL -- has made possible to do such precise positioning also in real time, giving us the PPP technique.  

With the advent of [[Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS) such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), precise positioning has been incorporated into production processes in mining, agriculture and construction. The main application has been in [[machine guidance]] and machine automation which require high levels of precision.

Precise positioning is also increasingly used in the fields of [[robotics]] and autonomous navigation.

In the field of [[geodesy]], '''Receiver Independent Exchange Format''' ('''RINEX''') is a data interchange format for raw [[global navigation satellite system|satellite navigation system]] data. This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result &amp;mdash; usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement.

The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of these quantities are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is interesting to store intermediate measures for later use. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications, whatever the manufacturer of both the receiver and the computer application.

The RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The first RINEX version was published by W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. Since 1993 the RINEX 2 is available, which has been revised and adopted several times. RINEX enables storage of measurements of [[pseudorange]], [[Global_Positioning_System#Carrier_phase_tracking_.28surveying.29|carrier-phase]], [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and signal-to-noise from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] (including [[GPS modernization signals]] e.g. L5 and L2C), [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]], [[Beidou_navigation_satellite_system|Beidou]], along with data from [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service|EGNOS]] and [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]] [[satellite based augmentation system]]s (SBAS), [[QZSS]], simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013 and is capable of new measurements{{what|date=March 2014}} from [[GPS modernization|GPS]] or [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]] systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.03 from July 2015 with update 1 to 3.03 published in 2017.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107"&gt;{{cite web|title=RINEX The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 3.03, Update 1|url=ftp://igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex303_update1.pdf|publisher=International GNSS Service|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not part of the RINEX format, the ''Hatanaka compression scheme '' is commonly used to reduced the size of RINEX files, resulting in an ASCII-based CompactRINEX format.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107" /&gt;. It uses higher-order time differences to reduce the number of characters needed to store time data.&lt;ref name="Hatanaka2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatanaka|first1=Yuki|title=A Compression Format and Tools for GNSS Observation Data|url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000045517.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geodesy]], a '''reference ellipsoid''' is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the [[geoid]], the truer [[figure of the Earth]], or other planetary body.
Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which [[geodetic network]] computations are performed and point coordinates such as [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[elevation]] are defined.

In the context of standardization and geographic applications, a ''geodesic reference ellipsoid'' is the mathematical model used as foundation by [[Spatial reference system]] or [[Geodetic datum]] definitions.

In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] in which he included a proof&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in Andrew Motte translation, available on line at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA239]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}} that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution which he termed an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroid]].

In the rare instances (some [[asteroid]]s and [[planet]]s) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is [[Triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial]] (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-[[GPS]]) ellipsoids are centred at the actual [[center of mass]] of the Earth or body being modeled.

The shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that [[ellipse]] which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The [[semi-major axis]] of the ellipse, ''a'', is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the [[semi-minor axis]] of the ellipse, ''b'', is identified with the [[Geographic pole|polar]] distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the ''inverse ''[[flattening]], {{sfrac|''f''}}, The flattening, ''f'', is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: 
:&lt;math&gt; f=\frac{a-b}{a}. &lt;/math&gt;
For the [[Earth]], ''f'' is around {{sfrac|300}} corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}}. Some precise values are given in the table below and also in [[Figure of the Earth]]. For comparison, Earth's [[Moon]] is even less elliptical, with a flattening of less than {{sfrac|825}}, while [[Jupiter]] is visibly oblate at about {{sfrac|15}} and one of [[Saturn|Saturn's]] triaxial moons, [[Telesto (moon)|Telesto]], is nearly {{sfrac|3}} to {{sfrac|2}}.

A great many other parameters are used in [[geodesy]] but they can all be related to one or two of the set ''a'', ''b'' and ''f''. They are listed in [[ellipse]].

== Coordinates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|Latitude|Longitude}}
A primary use of reference ellipsoids is to serve as a basis for a coordinate system of [[latitude]] (north/south), [[longitude]] (east/west), and [[elevation]] (height).
For this purpose it is necessary to identify a ''zero [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'', which for Earth is usually the [[Prime Meridian]]. For other bodies a fixed surface feature is usually referenced, which for Mars is the meridian passing through the crater [[Airy-0]]. It is possible for many different coordinate systems to be defined upon the same reference ellipsoid.

The longitude measures the rotational [[angle]] between the zero meridian and the measured point. By convention for the Earth, Moon, and Sun it is expressed in degrees ranging from −180° to +180° For other bodies a range of 0° to 360° is used.

The latitude measures how close to the poles or equator a point is along a meridian, and is represented as an angle from −90° to +90°, where 0° is the equator. The common or ''geodetic latitude'' is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference ellipsoid. Depending on the flattening, it may be slightly different from the ''geocentric (geographic) latitude'', which is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the ellipsoid. For non-Earth bodies the terms ''planetographic'' and ''planetocentric'' are used instead.

The coordinates of a geodetic point are customarily stated as geodetic latitude and longitude, i.e., the direction in space of the geodetic normal containing the point, and the height ''h'' of the point over the reference ellipsoid. See [[geodetic system]] for more detail. If these coordinates, i.e., latitude ''ϕ'', longitude ''λ'' and height ''h'', are given, one can compute the ''geocentric rectangular coordinates'' of the point as follows:&lt;ref name="gps-chap10"&gt;{{cite book|title=GPS - theory and practice|author=B. Hofmann-Wellenhof, H. Lichtenegger, J. Collins|isbn=3-211-82839-7|page=282|others=Section 10.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\cos{\lambda} \\
Y &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\sin{\lambda} \\
Z &amp;= \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} N(\phi) + h\right)\sin{\phi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;N(\phi) = \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\phi + b^2\sin^2 \phi }},&lt;/math&gt;
and ''a'' and ''b'' are the equatorial radius ([[semi-major axis]]) and the polar radius ([[semi-minor axis]]), respectively. ''N'' is the ''[[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] in the [[prime vertical]]''.

In contrast, extracting ''φ'', ''λ'' and ''h'' from the rectangular coordinates usually requires [[Iterative method|iteration]]. A straightforward method is given in an [[OSGB]] publication&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain. This is available as a pdf document at

== Historical Earth ellipsoids ==
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
{{Main|Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids}}
Currently the most common reference ellipsoid used, and that used in the context of the Global Positioning System, is the one defined by [[WGS 84]].

Traditional reference ellipsoids or ''[[geodetic datum]]s'' are defined regionally and therefore non-geocentric, e.g., [[ED50]]. Modern geodetic datums are established with
the aid of [[GPS]] and will therefore be geocentric, e.g., WGS 84.

== Ellipsoids for other planetary bodies ==
Reference ellipsoids are also useful for geodetic mapping of other planetary bodies including planets, their satellites, asteroids and comet nuclei. Some well observed bodies such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] now have quite precise reference ellipsoids.

For rigid-surface nearly-spherical bodies, which includes all the rocky planets and many moons, ellipsoids are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the mean surface height excluding any atmosphere. Mars is actually [[Oval (geometry)|egg shaped]], where its north and south polar radii differ by approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=in}}, however this difference is small enough that the average polar radius is used to define its ellipsoid. The Earth's Moon is effectively spherical, having almost no bulge at its equator. Where possible, a fixed observable surface feature is used when defining a reference meridian.

For gaseous planets like [[Jupiter]], an effective surface for an ellipsoid is chosen as the equal-pressure boundary of one [[Bar (unit)|bar]]. Since they have no permanent observable features, the choices of prime meridians are made according to mathematical rules.

Small moons, asteroids, and comet nuclei frequently have irregular shapes. For some of these, such as Jupiter's [[Io (moon)|Io]], a scalene (triaxial) ellipsoid is a better fit than the oblate spheroid. For highly irregular bodies, the concept of a reference ellipsoid may have no useful value, so sometimes a spherical reference is used instead and points identified by planetocentric latitude and longitude. Even that can be problematic for [[convex set|non-convex]] bodies, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], in that latitude and longitude don't always uniquely identify a single surface location.

[[File:Sonnensensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Non-linear sun sensor used by the [[TET-1]] German [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]].]]
A '''sun sensor''' is a [[navigational instrument]] used by [[spacecraft]] to detect the position of the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="airbus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt; Sun sensors are used for [[attitude control]], [[solar array]] pointing, [[gyroscope|gyro]] updating, and [[safe mode (spacecraft)|fail-safe]] recovery.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adcole_HA"/&gt;

In addition to spacecraft, sun sensors find use in ground-based [[weather station]]s and sun-tracking systems, and aerial vehicles including [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
There are various types of sun sensors, which differ in their technology and performance characteristics. Sun presence sensors provide a [[binary number|binary]] output, indicating when the sun is within the sensor's [[field of view]]. [[Analog electronics|Analog]] and [[digital electronics|digital]] sun sensors, in contrast, indicate the angle of the sun by continuous and [[discrete signal]] outputs, respectively.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

In typical sun sensors, a thin slit at the top of a rectangular chamber allows a line of light to fall on an array of [[photodetector]] cells at the bottom of the chamber. A voltage is induced in these cells, which is registered electronically. By orienting two sensors perpendicular to each other, the direction of the sun can be fully determined.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

Often, multiple sensors will share processing electronics.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;

==Criteria==
There are a number of design and performance criteria which dictate the selection of a sun sensor model:
*[[Field of view]]
*[[Angular resolution]]
*[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]] and [[Stochastic drift|stability]]
*[[Mass]] and [[volume]]
*Input voltage and power
*Output characteristics (including electrical characteristics, update frequency, [[nonlinearity]], and encoding)
*Durability (including [[radiation hardening]] and tolerance to [[vibration]] and [[residual stress|thermal cycling]])

[[File:Young George Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|A youthful George Washington surveying at Pope's Creek, Virginia.]]
The history of '''[[surveying]] in early America''' included the mapping of large, unknown territories and the layout of the [[District of Columbia]]. Several presidents were involved, including George Washington.

==The Founding Father as surveyor==
[[George Washington]] was not only a founding political father of the U.S., he was a founding surveyor of Virginia, as well. At the age of eleven, he inherited [[Ferry Farm]]. When George reached school age, instead of a career in the [[Royal Navy]], George went to school to study surveying and geometry. His first surveying tools were from his own storehouse on Ferry Farm.&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;[http://frontiers.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html Frontiers: George Washington, surveyor and mapmaker]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, under the tutelage of [[Joshua Fry]], he surveyed the northern neck of Virginia and became the county surveyor for [[Culpeper County, Virginia]]. By the time of the [[French and Indian War]], he had laid out most of northern Virginia, and this knowledge would contribute to his success during the war.

From 1747 to 1799, he surveyed 200 tracts of land, and due to his also being a land speculator, he amassed {{convert|65000|acres|km2}} of land.&lt;ref name="GW" /&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], he appointed the first geographer of the [[Continental Army]], [[Robert Erskine]].

==Surveying the District of Columbia==
Surveying was not only for the wealthy plantation owners, but the entire new nation needed to be surveyed, and resurveyed. Most of all, the proposed new capital city, bearing Washington’s name, needed to be surveyed. A two-man team would survey what became the District of Columbia in 1791. The first was [[Benjamin Banneker]], a free ex-slave, who learned to read, write, and do math from his grandmother. Banneker would go on to be a leading astronomer, mathematician, clock maker, and most of all, a surveyor. The second man was [[Andrew Ellicott]]. He would go on to do several prominent surveys of the area and assist [[Lewis and Clark]] in planning their expedition.

==The training of a naturalist==
[[File:Jefferson statue detail North Grounds UVa.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Statue of Jefferson surveying a site for the [[University of Virginia]]]]
Prior to independence, [[Peter Jefferson]], along with his son [[Thomas Jefferson]], were land surveyors for the crown. At this time, surveyors used a system known as the [[metes and bounds]] system, which used "monuments"; identifiable objects such as rocks, trees etc., as property markers. The surveyor would measure from monument to monument. The major problem with this system was the fact that these monuments were not necessarily permanent. As a result, Thomas Jefferson was involved in the creation the [[Public Land Survey System]]. A comparison of county boundaries in the various states graphically displays the difference between the systems, as counties in the Eastern states are irregularly shaped whereas counties in the Midwest tend to be square or rectangular.

Needing money to pay the debts for the Revolutionary War, Jefferson began selling land in the [[Northwest Territory]] in plots of {{convert|160|acres|m2}} for $2.50 an acre. Soon after, he sold the land in plots of {{convert|80|acres|m2}} for 1.25 an acre. The NW Territory was surveyed using the Rectangular System. This system used a central point determined by a Principal North-South Meridian Line and an East-West Base line.

Jefferson convinced Congress to accept the land deal with [[Napoleon]]. As a result of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and Jefferson’s love for nature, Jefferson organized the Lewis and Clark expedition. Andrew Ellicott taught Lewis and Clark how to use a [[sextant]] to map their position. Lewis and Clark would leave from [[Wood River, Illinois]] and document the wilderness all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

==Lincoln: politics and surveying==
Abraham Lincoln came to [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in 1831, and shortly after in 1832, he lost in his bid to become a state representative. The [[Sangamon County]] Surveyor, John Calhoun, then offered Lincoln a job as Deputy Surveyor due to the high volume of resurveying.

As Deputy Surveyor, Lincoln surveyed five towns, four roads, and thirty properties. The first was the [[plat]] for Huron, a proposed town {{convert|30|mi|km}} North of Springfield that never came to be. The proposal was that county would build a canal to straighten the [[Sangamon River]], but the canal was never built. The last town Lincoln laid out was [[New Boston, Illinois|New Boston]], a town at the confluence of the [[Iowa River]] and the Mississippi River. Instead of payment for his work, Lincoln had his surveying equipment repossessed and sold. Unknown to Lincoln, Jimmy Short, a friend, bought all of his equipment, his horse, and his saddlebags. Short returned Lincoln’s surveying equipment and later, as president, Lincoln returned the favor by making Short the [[Indian Agent]] of the Round Lake Indian Reservation.

'''Time To First Fix''' ('''TTFF''') is a measure of the time required for a [[GPS receiver]] to acquire satellite signals and navigation data, and calculate a position solution (called a [[Fix (position)|fix]]).
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|thumb|right|240px|An animation depicting the orbits of GPS satellites in medium earth orbit.]]

==Scenarios==
The TTFF is commonly broken down into three more specific scenarios, as defined in the GPS equipment guide:

* '''Cold''' or '''Factory''': The receiver is missing, or has inaccurate estimates of, its position, velocity, the time, or the visibility of any of the GPS satellites. As such, the receiver must systematically search for all possible satellites. After acquiring a satellite signal, the receiver can begin to obtain approximate information on all the other satellites, called the [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac]]. This almanac is transmitted repeatedly over 12.5 minutes. Almanac data can be received from any of the GPS satellites and is considered valid for up to 180 days. Manufacturers typically claim the factory TTFF to be 15 minutes.
* '''Warm''' or '''Normal''': The receiver has estimates of the current time within 20 seconds, the current position within 100 kilometers, and its velocity within 25&amp;nbsp;m/s, and it has valid almanac data. It must acquire each satellite signal and obtain that satellite's detailed orbital information, called [[ephemeris]] data. Each satellite broadcasts its ephemeris data every 30 seconds, and is valid for up to four hours.
* '''Hot''' or '''standby''': The receiver has valid time, position, almanac, and ephemeris data, enabling a rapid acquisition of satellite signals. The time required of a receiver in this state to calculate a position fix may also be termed ''Time to Subsequent fix'' (TTSF)

Many receivers can use as many as twelve channels simultaneously, allowing quicker fixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/why12.htm GPS information site] Why twelve channels?&lt;/ref&gt; Many cell phones reduce the time to first fix by using [[assisted GPS]] (A-GPS): they acquire almanac and ephemeris data over a fast network connection from the cell phone operator rather than over the slow radio connection from the satellites.

A '''tourist landscape''' can be described as constructed through a large number of symbolic and material transformations of an original physical and/or socioeconomic landscape in order to serve the interests of tourists and the tourist industry.

Since the early days of [[tourism]], [[landscape]] has played an important role in the decision making for holiday destinations. In trying to escape from an ordinary taken-for-granted-world, people of all periods have looked to far-away landscapes in order to re-create.

Landscapes are no longer exclusively shaped by the productive claims of agricultural interests. Their forms are increasingly frequently a reflection of the consumer demand and recreation, tourism and even nature conservation combine to model the ‘new [[aesthetics]] of nature’  (Wilson, 1992). The media shows people ever more varied images of their surroundings. Commercial broadcast by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], vacation folders displayed by the tour operators and tourist boards, and the travel reports published in magazines determine to a large degree how the ideal tourist landscape appearance. The most influential parties come from the new middle class, consisting of individuals and groups who are concentrated in professions like the media and fashion, education, and the arts and sciences. In this context the tourism industry constructs the rural idyll, an understanding of the [[countryside]] based partly on reality, but largely on nostalgia and romance:

:It is sustained and developed by media images and popular imagination. It portrays a world of unchanging values, traditional and community living which some people feel with regret has been lost forever from their own lives. The heritage industry has developed to meet such expectations. It packages and presents aspect of the heritage in ways which broadly sustain the illusion of unchanging values(The National Trust, 1995, 11).

However, by this aesthetic appropriation the landscape has become an assemblage of beautiful forms that ignores the basically vital aspects.

A related problem is that tourism landscapes are frequently subject to the characteristic problems of common pool resources - a tendency toward overuse and a lack of incentive for individuals to invest in maintaining or improving the resource (Healy, 1994). Scenic landscapes are often the result of active (traditional) land management. The fading away of the pastoral economy in Alpine regions or the traditional orchard economy  in parts of the Mediterranean threatens the characteristic scenery of old cultural landscapes.

==The Mediterranean landscape==
To the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] the [[Mediterranean landscape]] represented an ideal that has to be admired, sketched, painted and visited. From the beginning of the nineteenth century on the Mediterranean landscape functioned as a promotional objective of the nascent tourist industry. The presence of celebrities and highly effective publicity campaigns in combination with the work of many artists turned the regional geographical landscape into a tourist landscape, a dream space for the twentieth century.
Luginbühl (1992) suggests that tourist publicity posters that appeared toward the end of the nineteenth century were used to represent the Mediterranean landscape and to reinforce the selective view of that landscape held by an elite stratum of society.
Characteristic of these posters is the emphasis on the ‘exotic’ in the Mediterranean landscape. Plant life especially is used to symbolise the ideal tourist scenery whilst constructing a landscape that retreats from reality:

:The Mediterranean landscape is replaced with a landscape in which the only thing that is Mediterranean is the stuff of the tourist promotion: a beach, a palm-tree, and a couple browning their skin in the sun or letting their hair blow in the wind. The Mediterranean landscape no longer exists, because it has been made palatable to all(Luginbühl, 1992, 227).

==The pilgrim’s way to Santiago de Compostela==
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
Another example of impressive transformations is the pilgrim’s way to [[Santiago de Compostela]], one of the most famous long distance routes in Europe. The different itineraries  formed a kind of religious network in the past. Now the EC  has discovered the importance of this route and has themed it as the cultural route of Europe. Subsidised by EC funds a considerable part of the authentic pilgrim’s way in the [[Tiere de Campos]] in Northwestern Spain has been  completely transformed into a comfortable tracking road. Trees have been  planted on every ten meters, supplied with water by a smart irrigation system. After every kilometer the tired modern pilgrim can take some rest. Nobody has to be afraid in getting lost in this area because even the smallest village is signposted by an impressive stone. So the suffering of the former pilgrims has become unreachable for the modern ones. They are degraded to ordinary tourists. And the landscape? It is rationalised and it seems to be a question of time before the first multinational company establishes a chain of fast-food outlets along the route.

==Holiday villages==

In the [[Netherlands]] the ideal of an ‘exotic holiday-destination’ is without any doubt strongly influenced by the image of the Mediterranean landscape. It is incorporated in the designing of [[holiday village]]s and the enormous increase of these facilities in the last decades has transformed parts of the Netherlands into real leisure landscapes. The encroachment of brick and concrete over the landscape is visible in favourable tourist regions such as the coastal zones and the [[Veluwe]] region. The high quality holiday villages sell a subtropical illusion in a country with a temperate maritime climate. The Mediterranean concept became predominant in the design, the range of services and the names of resorts such as Porte Zelande or Porte Grève in the province of [[Zeeland]]. The inspiration for the design of Porte Zelande on the Brouwersdam was drawn from [[Port Grimaud]] in southern France. 
Port Grimaud can be considered as one of the most well-known examples of a radical landscape transformation. In 1962, the architect Spoerry acquired a stretch of marshy land near Saint Tropez. He transformed this area to the ultimate example of future leisure ports.

Beach parks and résidences have become popular and change the landscape dramatically in certain regions. Another example can be find along the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] coast in southern France in the huge leisure based urbanisation around [[Port Leucate.]]
[[Image:Port Leucate (Aude), view from Étang to harbour.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Port Leucate in southern France]]
In order to differentiate themselves to win the favour of clients, resorts ponder to the attractive environment in the form of landscape and culture. In addition to some holyday villages, [[golf links]] are also making inroads on the countryside. The holiday villages developed most recently tend to be in the immediate vicinity of nature preserves or the sea coast. The use that people make of the surroundings of a holiday village is becoming more and more intensive, changing the appearance of the landscape into a tourist landscape.

{{TOC limit|2}}

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid parameters==

The series must be used with a  [[Datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] which specifies the position, orientation and shape of a [[Figure of the Earth|Reference ellipsoid]]. Although the projection formulae depend only on the shape parameters of the reference ellipsoid the full set of datum parameters is necessary to link the projection coordinates to true positions in three-dimensional space. The datums and reference ellipsoids associated with particular implementations of the Redfearn formulae are listed [[#Implementations|below]].  A comprehensive list of important ellipsoids is given in the article on the [[Figure of the Earth#table|Figure of the Earth]].

{{space|5}}In specifying ellipsoids it is normal to give the [[semi-major axis]] (equatorial axis), &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, along with either the [[Flattening|inverse flattening]], &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt;, or the  [[semi-minor axis]] (polar axis), &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes both.  The series presented below use the eccentricity, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, in preference to the flattening, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. In addition they use the parameters &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[Flattening#First and second flattening|third flattening]], and &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|second eccentricity]]. There are only two independent shape parameters and there are many relations between them: in particular
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 f&amp;=\frac{a-b}{a}, \qquad  e^2=2f-f^2, \qquad e'^2=\frac{e^2}{1-e^2}\\
b&amp;=a(1-f)=a(1-e^2)^{1/2},\qquad  n=\frac{a-b}{a+b}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The projection formulae also involve  &lt;math&gt;\rho(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of the meridian (at latitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\nu(\phi) &lt;/math&gt;,  the radius of curvature in the [[prime vertical]].
(The prime vertical is the vertical plane orthogonal to the  meridian plane at a point on the ellipsoid). The radii of curvature  are defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nu(\phi)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}},
\qquad
\rho(\phi)=\frac{\nu^3(1-e^2)}{a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In addition  the functions &lt;math&gt;\beta(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\beta(\phi)=\frac{\nu(\phi)}{\rho(\phi)},\qquad
   \eta^2=\beta-1={e'^2\cos^2\!\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For compactness it is normal to introduce the following abbreviations:
:&lt;math&gt;
s=\sin\phi,\qquad
c=\cos\phi,\qquad
t=\tan\phi.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==Preliminaries II: meridian distance==

===Meridian distance===
The article on [[Meridian arc]] describes several methods of computing &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the meridian distance  from the equator to a point at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; : the expressions given below are those used in the '''actual'' implementation of the Transverse Mercator projection by the OSGB.&lt;ref name=osgb /&gt; The truncation error is less than 0.1mm so the series is certainly accurate to within 1mm, the design tolerance of the OSGB implementation.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m(\phi)&amp;=B_0\phi+B_2\sin 2\phi+B_4\sin4\phi+B_6\sin6\phi+\cdots,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients are given to order &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt; (order &lt;math&gt;e^6&lt;/math&gt;) by
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 B_0  &amp;=  b\bigg(1+n+\frac{5}{4}n^2+\frac{5}{4}n^3 \bigg),
 \qquad
B_4 =  b\bigg(\frac{15}{16}n^2+\frac{15}{16}n^3 \bigg),\\
 B_2  &amp;= -    b\bigg(\frac{3}{2}n+\frac{3}{2}n^2+\frac{21}{16}n^3 \bigg),
 \qquad
 B_6 = -    b\bigg(\frac{35}{48}n^3\bigg).
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The meridian distance from equator to pole is 
::&lt;math&gt;m_p=m(\pi/2)=\pi B_0/2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The form of the series specified for UTM is a variant of the above exhibiting higher order terms with a truncation error of 0.03mm.

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

====Inverse meridian distance====

Neither the OSGB nor the UTM implementations define an inverse series for  the meridian distance; instead they use an iterative scheme. For a given meridian distance &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; first set &lt;math&gt;\phi_0=M/B_0&lt;/math&gt; and then iterate using
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\phi_n=\phi_{n-1}+ \frac{M-m(\phi_{n-1})}{B_0}, \qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
until &lt;math&gt;|M-m(\phi_{n-1})|&lt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;mm.

{{space|5}}The inversion ''can'' be effected by a series, presented here for later reference.  For a given meridian distance, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,  define the [[latitude|rectifying latitude]] by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mu=\frac{\pi M}{2 m_p}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The geodetic latitude corresponding to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is (Snyder&lt;ref name=snyder /&gt; page 17)&lt;!--(Krüger,&lt;ref name=kruger /&gt; page 12&amp;ndash;13)--&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\phi&amp;=\mu+D_2\sin 2\mu+D_4\sin4\mu+D_6\sin6\mu+D_8\sin8\mu+\cdots,\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where, to &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  D_2 &amp; = \frac{3}{2}n-\frac{27}{32}n^3, &amp;
  D_4 &amp; = \frac{21}{16}n^2-\frac{55}{32}n^4,\\[8pt]
  D_6 &amp; = \frac{151}{96}n^3, &amp;
  D_8 &amp; = \frac{1097}{512}n^4.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==An outline of the method==
&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;
The normal aspect of the Mercator projection of a  sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is described by the equations
:&lt;math&gt;
x  = R\lambda, \qquad\qquad y  = R\psi,
&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Latitude#Isometric latitude|isometric latitude]], is given by
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\psi &amp;= \ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--  &amp; = \frac {1}{2} \ln \left[ \frac {1 + \sin\phi}{1 - \sin\phi} \right] \\[2ex]
  &amp; = \sinh^{-1} \left( \tan\phi\right)
  &amp; = \tanh^{-1} \left( \sin\phi\right)--&gt;

On the ellipsoid the isometric latitude becomes
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\psi &amp;= \ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \right]
      -\frac{e}{2} \ln \left[ \frac {1 + e\sin\phi}{1 - e\sin\phi} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
By construction, the projection from the geodetic coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to the coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) is conformal. If the coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) are used to define a point &lt;math&gt;\zeta=\psi+i\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane, then any analytic function &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; will define another conformal projection. Kruger's method involves seeking the specific &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;  which generates a uniform scale along the central meridian, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;.  He achieved this by investigating a Taylor series approximation with the projection coordinates  given by:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y+ix&amp;=f(\zeta)=f(\psi+i\lambda)\\
    &amp;= f(\psi+i.0) + A_1\lambda+ A_2\lambda^2+ A_3\lambda^3+ \ldots,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the real part of &lt;math&gt;f(\psi+i.0)&lt;/math&gt; must be proportional  to the meridian distance function &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. The (complex) coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; depend on derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; which can be reduced to derivatives of &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, (not &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). The derivatives are straightforward to evaluate in principle but the expressions become very involved at high orders because of the  complicated relation between &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Separation of real and imaginary parts gives the series for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and further derivatives give the scale and convergence factors.

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==The series in detail==
This section presents  the eighth order series as published by Redfearn&lt;ref name=Redfearn/&gt; (but with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; interchanged and the longitude difference from the central meridian denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;). Equivalent eighth order series, with different notations, can be found in Snyder&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{Cite book| author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections &amp;ndash; A Working Manual. U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 | publisher =United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. | year=1987}}This paper can be downloaded from [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395 USGS pages.] It gives full details of most projections, together with interesting introductory sections, but it does not derive any of the projections from first principles.&lt;/ref&gt; (pages 60&amp;ndash;64) and at many web sites such as that for the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;{{cite web |title=A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain |format=PDF |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{space|5}}The direct series are developed in terms of the longitude difference from the central meridian, expressed in radians: the inverse series are developed in terms of the ratio  &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;. The projection is normally restricted to narrow zones (in longitude) so that both of the expansion parameters are typically less than about 0.1, guaranteeing rapid [[Convergence (mathematics)|convergence]]. For example in each [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] zone these expansion parameters are less than 0.053 and for the British national grid ([[British national grid reference system|NGGB]]) they are less than 0.09. All of the direct series giving &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, convergence &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are functions of both latitude and longitude and the parameters of the ellipsoid: all inverse series giving &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are functions of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the parameters of the ellipsoid.

===Direct series===
In the following series &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the ''difference'' of the longitude of an arbitrary point and the longitude of the chosen central meridian: &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is in radians and is positive east of the central meridian. The W coefficients are functions of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; listed [[#The coefficients for all series|below]].  The series for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the scaled meridian distance when &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x(\lambda,\phi)&amp;=k_0\nu\left[\lambda c
                      +\frac{\lambda^3c^3 W_3}{3!}
                      +\frac{\lambda^5c^5 W_5}{5!}
                      +\frac{\lambda^7c^7 W_7}{7!}\right] , \\[1ex]
  y(\lambda,\phi)&amp;=k_0\left[m(\phi) +\frac{\lambda^2 \nu c^2t}{2}
               +\frac{\lambda^4 \nu c^4tW_4}{4!}
               +\frac{\lambda^6 \nu c^6tW_6}{6!}
               +\frac{\lambda^8 \nu c^8tW_8}{8!} \right],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

===Inverse series===
The inverse series involve a further construct: the '''footpoint latitude'''. Given a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; on the projection the '''footpoint''' is defined as the point on the central meridian with coordinates &lt;math&gt;(0,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the scale on the central meridian is &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; the meridian distance from the equator to the footpoint is equal to &lt;math&gt;m=y/k_0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding footpoint latitude, &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, is calculated by iteration or the inverse meridian distance series as described above.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mu&amp;=\frac{\pi y}{2 m_p k_0},\\
\phi_1&amp;=\mu+D_2\sin 2\mu+D_4\sin4\mu+D_6\sin6\mu+D_8\sin8\mu+\cdots,\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Denoting functions evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; by a subscript '1', the inverse series are:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \lambda(x,y)
&amp;=
\frac{x}{c_1(k_0\nu_1)}
-\frac{x^{3}V_3}{3!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^3}
-\frac{x^{5}V_5}{5!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^5}
-\frac{x^{7}V_7}{7!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^7},
\\
\phi(x,y)&amp;=\phi_1
-\frac{x^2  \beta_1t_1 }{2(k_0\nu_1)^2}
-\frac{x^4 \beta_1t_1 U_4}{4!(k_0\nu_1)^4}
-\frac{x^6  \beta_1t_1 U_6}{6!(k_0\nu_1)^6}
-\frac{x^8 \beta_1t_1 U_8}{8!(k_0\nu_1)^8}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

===Point scale and convergence===
The point scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is independent of direction for a conformal transformation. It may be calculated in terms of geographic or projection coordinates. Note that the series for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; reduce to &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; when either &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; .  The convergence &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; may also be calculated (in radians) in terms of geographic or projection coordinates:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  k(\lambda,\phi)
&amp;=k_0\left[1
+\frac{\lambda^2c^2H_2}{2}
+\frac{\lambda^4c^4H_4}{24}
+\frac{\lambda^6c^6H_6}{720}\right],\\
\gamma(\lambda,\phi)
&amp;=\lambda s
+\frac{\lambda^3c^3t H_3}{3}
+\frac{\lambda^5c^5t H_5}{15}
+\frac{\lambda^7c^7tH_7}{315},\\
k(x,y)&amp;=k_0\left[1
+\frac{x^2K_2}{2(k_0\nu_1)^2}
+\frac{x^4K_4}{24(k_0\nu_1)^4}
+\frac{x^6K_6}{720(k_0\nu_1)^6}\right]\\
\gamma(x,y) &amp;=
\frac{xt_1}{k_0\nu_1}
 + \frac{x^3t_1 K_3}{3(k_0\nu_1)^3}
 + \frac{x^5t_1 K_5}{15(k_0\nu_1)^5}
 + \frac{x^7t_1 K_7}{315(k_0\nu_1)^7}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Accuracy of the series===

The exact solution of Lee-Thompson,&lt;ref name=lee_exact&gt;Lee, L.P. (1976). ''Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions'' (Supplement No. 1 to Canadian Cartographer, Vol 13.) pp. 1&amp;ndash;14, 92&amp;ndash;101 and 107&amp;ndash;114. Toronto: Department of Geography, York University. A report of unpublished analytic formulae involving incomplete elliptic integrals obtained by E. H. Thompson in 1945. Available from the [http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/120327/?sortorder=asc&amp;p_o=113|University of Toronto Press].&lt;/ref&gt;  implemented by Karney (2011),&lt;ref name=karney&gt;C. F. F. Karney (2011), ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00190-011-0445-3 Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers],'' J. Geodesy 85(8), 475-485 (2011); preprint of paper and C++ implementation of algorithms are available at [https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/tm.html geographiclib.sourceforge.io]&lt;/ref&gt; is of great value  in assessing the accuracy of the truncated Redfearn series.  It confirms that the truncation error  of the (eighth order) Redfearn series is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to a longitude difference of 3 degrees, corresponding to a distance of 334&amp;nbsp;km from the central meridian at the equator but a mere 35&amp;nbsp;km at the northern limit of an UTM zone.

{{space|5}}The Redfearn series become much worse as the zone widens. Karney discusses Greenland as an instructive example. The long thin landmass is centred on 42W and, at its broadest point, is no more than 750&amp;nbsp;km from that meridian whilst the span in longitude reaches almost 50 degrees. The Redfearn series attain a maximum error of 1&amp;nbsp;'''kilometre'''.

==Implementations==
The implementations give below are examples of the use of the Redfearn series. The defining documents in various countries differ slightly in notation and, more importantly, in the neglect of some of the small terms. The analysis of small terms depends on the latitude and longitude ranges in the various grids. There are also slight differences in the formulae utilised for meridian distance: one extra term is sometimes added to the formula specified above but such a term is less than 0.1mm.

===OSGB===
The implementation of the transverse Mercator projection in Great Britain is fully described in the [[OSGB]] document [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/support/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain], Appendices A.1, A.2 and C.&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt;
::datum: OSGB36
::ellipsoid: Airy 1830
:: major axis: 6 377 563.396
:: minor axis: 6 356 256.909
::central meridian longitude: 2°W
::central meridian scale factor : 0.9996012717
:: projection origin: 2°W and 0°N
::true grid origin: 2°W and 49°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0 (metres): 400,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0 (metres): -100,000
::E = E0 + x = 400000 + x
::N = N0 + y -k0*m(49°)= y - 5527063
The extent of the grid is 300&amp;nbsp;km to the east and 400&amp;nbsp;km to the west of the central meridian and 1300&amp;nbsp;km north from the ''false'' origin, (OSGB&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt; Section 7.1), but with the exclusion of parts of Northern Ireland, Eire and France. A [[grid reference]] is denoted by the pair (E,N) where E ranges from slightly over zero to 800000m and N ranges from zero to 1300000m. To reduce the number of figures needed to give a grid reference, the grid is divided into 100&amp;nbsp;km squares, which each have a two-letter code. National Grid positions can be given with this code followed by an easting  and a northing both in the range 0 and 99999m. 

{{space|5}}The projection formulae differ slightly from the Redfearn formulae presented here. They have been simplified by neglect of most terms of seventh and eighth order in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;: the only exception is seventh order term in the series for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;. This simplification is based on the examination of the Redfearn terms over the ''actual'' extent of the grid. The only other differences are (a) the absorption of the central scale factor into the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]] and [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]], (b) the replacement of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (defined [[#Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid|above]]).

The OSGB manual&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt;  includes a discussion of the [[Helmert transformation]]s which are required to link [[Geodetic datum|geodetic]] coordinates on Airy 1830 [[Reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] and on WGS84.

===UTM===
The article on the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator projection]] gives a general survey, but the full specification is defined in U.S. Defense Mapping Agency  Technical Manuals TM8358.1&lt;ref name=utm1 /&gt; and TM8358.2.&lt;ref name=utm2 /&gt; This section provides details for '''zone 30''' as another example of the Redfearn formulae  (usually termed Thomas formulae in the United States.)
::ellipsoid: International 1924 (a.k.a. Hayford 1909)
:: major axis: 6 378 388.000
:: minor axis: 6 356 911.946
::central meridian longitude: 3°W
:: projection origin: 3°W and 0°N
::central meridian scale factor: 0.9996
::true grid origin: 3°W and 0°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0: 500,000
::E = E0 + x = 500000 + x
::northern hemisphere false northing of true grid origin N0: 0
::northern hemisphere: N = N0 + y = y
::southern hemisphere false northing of true grid origin N0: 10,000,000
::southern hemisphere: N = N0 + y = 10,000,000 + y
The series adopted for the meridian distance incorporates terms of fifth order in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but the manual states that these are less than 0.03&amp;nbsp;mm (TM8358.2&lt;ref name=utm2 /&gt; Chapter 2).  The projection formulae use, &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt;, the second eccentrity (defined [[#Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid|above]]) instead of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The grid reference schemes are defined in the article [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]]. The accuracy claimed for the UTM projections is 10&amp;nbsp;cm in grid coordinates and 0.001 arc seconds for geodetic coordinates.

===Ireland===
The transverse Mercator projection in Eire and Northern Ireland (an international implementation spanning one country and part of another) is currently  implemented  in two ways:

[[Irish grid reference system]]
::datum: Ireland 1965
::ellipsoid: Airy 1830 modified
:: major axis: 6 377 340.189
:: minor axis: 6 356 034.447
::central meridian scale factor: 1.000035
::true origin: 8°W and 53.5°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0: 200,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0: 250,000
The Irish grid uses the OSGB projection formulae.

[[Irish Transverse Mercator]]
::datum: Ireland 1965
::ellipsoid: [[GRS80]]
:: major axis: 6 378 137
:: minor axis: 6 356 752.314140
::central meridian scale factor: 0.999820
::true origin: 8°W and 53.5°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0: 600,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0: 750,000
This is an interesting example of the transition between use of a traditional ellipsoid and a modern global ellipsoid. The adoption of radically different false origins helps to prevent confusion between the two systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">[[File:Schlauchwaage_Schematik.svg|thumb|A water level device showing both ends at the same height]]

A '''water level'''; {{lang-el|'''[[Aλφαδολάστιχο]]''' or '''[[(υδροστάθμη)]]'''}} ''[Alfadolasticho]'' is a device used for matching [[elevation]]s of locations that are too far apart for a [[spirit level]] to span. The simplest water level is a section of clear tubing, partially filled with water. Water is easily procured for use, and easily discarded after use. The ends are held vertical, and the rest of the tubing lies on the ground or floor. The water level at each end of the tube will be at the same elevation, whether the two ends are adjacent or far apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Stoddard |url=http://www.deckmagazine.com/products/tools-equipment/making-and-using-a-water-level_o |title=Making and Using a Water Level |work=Professional Deck Builder |publisher=[[Hanley Wood]] Media |date=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water levels have been used for many years. The water level is [[low technology|lower-tech]] than the [[laser level]], but it can be more accurate over long distances, and works without a [[sightline]], such as around corners. To avoid error, all of the water should be at the same temperature. Other sources of [[error]] include difficulty reading due to [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]].

If the water level is used often, [[dye]] can be added to the water to make it easier to see. If the water level is used outdoors in winter, [[antifreeze]] can be added to the water. Automotive window washer fluid can also be used for antifreeze and increased visibility. Additionally it inhibits the formation of error causing bubbles. A [[surfactant]] (surface active agent), such as hand-[[dishwashing liquid]] [[detergent]], can be added to the water to significantly lower the [[surface tension]] of the water. This liquid solution will flow more easily and more rapidly in the tube than plain water, so operation of the device will be more precise, repeatable, and responsive – particularly when using a small-diameter tube. Also, this liquid solution can be emptied from a small-diameter tube more easily than plain water.
