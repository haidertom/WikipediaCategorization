=== The Royal Family ===

=== International Guests ===
A total of three [[heads of state]] from outside India attended the opening ceremony; two from [[List of members of the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] and one from a non-Commonwealth nation. The three head of states are [[Mohamed Nasheed]], [[President of the Maldives]], [[Marcus Stephen]], [[President of Nauru]] and a multiple Commonwealth gold medallist, and [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]], a former Olympian, whose country Monaco is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Four heads of state to attend CWG opener | url =http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/four-heads-of-state-to-attend-cwg-opener-56334 |date = 1 October 2010 | publisher = [[NDTV]] | location = New Delhi | accessdate = 2 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005015417/http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/four-heads-of-state-to-attend-cwg-opener-56334| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anand Satyanand|Sir Anand Satyanand]], the [[Governor General of New Zealand]] (the first of Indian descent), attended the ceremony as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of The Right Honourable Sir Anand Satyanand |url=http://www.gov-gen.govt.nz/the-governor-general/biogg |publisher=[[Government of New Zealand]] |format=biography |accessdate=4 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602152957/http://www.gov-gen.govt.nz/the-governor-general/biogg |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==

The opening ceremony featured aspects of India's heritage and culture in seven segments. It featured an [[aerostat]] costing U$8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beckett |first=Paul |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/10/04/the-aerostat-tech-marvel-or-stage-prop/ |title=The Aerostat: Tech Marvel or Stage Prop? - India Real Time - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006211900/https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/10/04/the-aerostat-tech-marvel-or-stage-prop/| archivedate= 6 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring 40×80x12 meters and manufactured in [[Oswestry]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Controversy-hit-aerostat-lights-up-Games-ceremony/Article1-607895.aspx |title=Controversy-hit aerostat lights up Games ceremony |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006024138/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Controversy-hit-aerostat-lights-up-Games-ceremony/Article1-607895.aspx| archivedate= 6 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was to have drummers on the aerostat, but the plan was cancelled.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt; The ceremony started with the [[Indian national anthem]] which was played live at the stadium. The roof of the stadium  turned into orange colour and the ground was lit up with three colours of the Indian flag - orange in the center, white in the middle and green near the boundary. 

===Rhythm of India===
[[File:Giant Puppets hang from the aerostat during the opening ceremony of the 19th Commonwealth Games Delhi-2010, in New Delhi on October 03, 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|Giant Puppets hang from the aerostat]]
The countdown for the opening of commonwealth games started as the drums were being played, and fireworks exploded from the roof of the stadium. The aerostat slowly raised from the ground to the center space of the roof while a traditional [[Rajasthani culture|Rajasthani]] hymn was being played by the musicians. Various Drummers from [[Kerala]], [[Manipur]], [[Karnataka]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Meghalaya]] played a symphony that aimed to be "uniquely Indian in character, yet global in appeal". Seven year old [[tabla]] player Keshav from Puducherry played the tabla instrument in front of the audience live and he was given a big applause from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/Child-prodigy-delights-spectators/article15771941.ece|title=Child prodigy delights spectators|last=Sarkar|first=Urvashi|date=2010-10-04|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swagatham===
[[File:Commonwealth games Delhi 2010 opening ceremony swagatham mehndi.png|thumb|School children from across delhi performed in this segment,intricate mehndi design was painted on large pieces of cloth in 30 seconds.|alt=|left]]
[[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]] led this segment, which created an amalgamation of Hindustani classical, Carnatic and folk music. The song was composed by [[A. R. Rahman]], who also composed the [[Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto|official theme song]] of the games, and was performed by various artists along with Hariharan. Children from various Delhi schools participated in a simultaneous performance forming hands of an Indian woman in a pose of [[Namaste]] - a popular Indian salutation. Later, they separated and rearranged themselves in another formation representing the Indian flag colors of saffron, white and green while another group of children entered the stadium and covered the flag formations with a large white cloth. In a widely appreciated act, the children then made a [[mehndi]] - a traditional Indian art - on this large white piece of cloth in under 30 seconds on the spot.
===Tree Of Knowledge===

Pt. [[Birju Maharaj]] ([[Kathak]]), Guru [[Rajkumar Singhajit Singh]]-Charu Sija Mathur ([[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]]), Dr. [[Saroja Vaidyanathan]] ([[Bharatnatyam]]), Dr. [[Sonal Mansingh]] ([[Odissi dance|Odissi]]), [[Bharati Shivaji]] ([[Mohiniattam]]) and Raja Reddy-Radha Reddy ([[Kuchipudi]]) choreographed 480 dancers bringing alive India's "Guru-Shishya Parampara" or the master-protege tradition on stage through classical dance recitals which also depicted four different [[Indian season|seasons of India]]. The aerostat (the largest ever helium balloon built for such an event) formed the leaves of the Bodhi tree, while large strips elevated from the ground, made of silk and bamboo fibre form the tree trunk.
===The Great Indian Journey===
[[File:A spectacular view of Jawahar Lal Nehru stadium during the opening ceremony of the 19th Commonwealth Games 2010-Delhi, in New Delhi on October 03, 2010 (1).jpg|thumb|Dancers from all the states of India performed at the ceremony]]
This segment will give a glimpse of the lives of the masses in India, as seen through a train window. Art director Omung Kumar created a 600-ft train of bamboo sticks for this. It portrayed a common man's life and every thing in it, such as the bangle shops, politicians campaigning, Bollywood, the cycle shop etc.
===Finale===

[[Academy Awards|Academy]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] award winner [[A.R. Rahman]] ended the programme with his rendition of "[[Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto]]", the theme song of the Delhi games, and "[[Jai Ho (song)|Jai Ho]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_dTKoii85I |title=commonwealth games 2010 opening ceremony A.R.Rahman |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-10-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101007114829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_dTKoii85I| archivedate= 7 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-R-Rahmans-grand-finale-with-Jeeyo-Utho/articleshow/6679650.cms|title=A R Rahman's grand finale with 'Jeeyo, Utho'|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=3 October 2010|date=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/rahman-brings-cwg-ceremony-to-electrifying-climax-news-national-kkdx4ccdbib.html|title=Rahman brings CWG ceremony to electrifying climax|publisher=[[Sify]]|accessdate=3 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006052925/http://sify.com/news/rahman-brings-cwg-ceremony-to-electrifying-climax-news-national-kkdx4ccdbib.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectators' response==

In the opening ceremony the head of organizing committee faced embarrassment, when he was booed by the spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 60,000 spectators in the opening ceremony. The atmosphere otherwise for the teams and officials was fine, especially when they offered warm applause to the neighbouring Pakistan squad, with whom it has tense relationships. Sri Lanka also got a loud applause. The head finished his speech in five minutes and then handed over to Michael Fennell, the Chief of the Commonwealth Games Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sport/games-spectators-boo-delhi-chief-organiser-at-opening-ceremony-jd-03 |title=Sport &amp;#124; Spectators boo chief organiser at opening ceremony |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=3 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014012850/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sport/games-spectators-boo-delhi-chief-organiser-at-opening-ceremony-jd-03 |archivedate=14 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''action game''' is a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as [[fighting game]]s, [[beat 'em up]]s, [[shooter game]]s and [[platform game]]s which are widely considered the most important action games, though [[multiplayer online battle arena]] and some [[real-time strategy]] games are also considered to be action games.

In an action game, the player typically controls a [[Character (arts)|character]] often in the form of a [[protagonist]] or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. This [[player character]] must navigate a [[Level (video gaming)|level]], collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major [[antagonist]] in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] and [[1-up|lives]], and the player receives a [[Game over]] when they run out of lives. Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels and seeing the [[Closing credits|credits]]. But some action games, such as early [[arcade games]], are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.

== Defining elements ==
The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times.&lt;ref name="NGen15"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=28-42|quote=Action game - A game characterized by simple action and response gameplay. ... the defining characteristic is that enemies and obstacles are overcome by 'physical' means, rather than involved intellectual problem solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may also encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew| authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game design ==

=== Levels ===

Players advance through an action game by completing a series of [[level design|levels]]. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. Increasingly, though, some games allow for 'resurrection' or 'cloning' and the opportunity to regain lost items upon death for a certain sum of ingame currency, typically increasing exponentially the more times the player dies. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Levels in an action game may be linear or [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]], and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player's avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Action games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player's score.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Character abilities ===
In most action games, the player controls a single [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] as the [[protagonist]].&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Players may find a [[power-up]] within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Obstacles and enemies ===
In action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex [[artificial intelligence]] to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appears in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth or attacking particular part of the Boss.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Health and lives ===
In many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player's avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as [[1-up|lives]]. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Graphics and interface ===
Action games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an [[artificial intelligence]] camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Scoring and victory ===
Action games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Many action games keep track of the player's score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in ''Pac-Man'' where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player's score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events. In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. On the other hand, games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

== Subgenres ==
Action games have several major subgenres. However, there are many action games without any clear subgenre, such as ''[[Frogger]]'', as well as other types of genres like Adventure or Strategy that have action elements.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Action-adventure game]]s''' mix elements of both action and adventure genres, examples include The Legend of Zelda, Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto series.

'''[[Beat 'em up]]s''' are games that involve fighting through a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stage of multiple adversaries, using martial arts or other close-range fighting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 | author = Spanner Spencer | publisher = EuroGamer | title = The Tao of Beat-'em-ups | date = 2008-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604002041/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archivedate = 2008-06-04 | author = Subskin | publisher = GameSpy | title = Reviews - Fighting Force 2 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fighting game]]s''' feature combat between pairs of fighters, usually using martial arts moves. Actions are limited to various attacks and defenses, and matches end when a fighter's health is reduced to zero. They often make use of special moves and combos. There are both 2D and 3D fighting games, but most 3D fighting games largely take place in a 2D plane and occasionally include side-stepping. They are distinct from [[sports game]]s such as boxing and wrestling games  which attempt to model movements and techniques more realistically.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[List of maze video games|Maze game]]s''' such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' involve navigating a maze to avoid or chase adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Intelligence and Technology | author = Robert J. Sternberg,  David Preiss | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Platform game]]s''' involve jumping between platforms of different heights, while battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. Physics are often unrealistic, and game levels are often vertically exaggerated. They exist in both 2D and 3D forms.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Rhythm game|Rhythm action games]]''' challenge the player's sense of rhythm, and award points for accurately pressing certain buttons in sync with a musical beat. This is a relatively new subgenre of action game.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; Rhythm games are sometimes classified as a type of [[music video game|music game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/ | title = One-On-One With Shigeru Miyamoto: From ‘Wii Music’ To Bowser To…  MotionPlus? | author = Stephen Totilo | date = 2008-10-27 | accessdate = 2009-02-20 | publisher = MTV | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115074435/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/| archivedate= 15 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Shooter game]]s''' allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy. Although shooting is usually a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as [[Splatoon]]. This subgenre includes [[first-person shooter]]s and [[third-person shooters]], as well as a plethora of other [[shoot 'em up]] games taking place from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] or side-view perspective.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Survival game]]s''' start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. A specific subgenre of survival game is [[Battle royale game|battle royale]].

== Physical impact ==
Studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the [[University of Rochester]] on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' compared to those playing ''[[Tetris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11123-action-computer-games-can-sharpen-eyesight.html  "Action computer games can sharpen eyesight"] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[arcade game]]s are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Researchers from ''[[Helsinki School of Economics]]'' have shown that people playing a ''[[first-person shooter]]'' might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was ''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2008/02/gamers-secretly-enjoy-getting-killed.html  "Gamers secretly enjoy getting killed "] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


A major turning point for action games came with the 1978 release of the [[shoot 'em up]] game ''[[Space Invaders]]'',&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which marked the beginning of the [[golden age of arcade video games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''Space Invaders''' mainstream success, the industry came to be dominated by action games,&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which have remained the most dominant [[Video game genres|genre]] in [[Amusement arcade|video arcades]] and on [[Video game console|game consoles]] through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''Space Invaders'',&lt;ref name="GS-SI-Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |title=The Gamespy Hall of Fame: Space Invaders |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |author=Kevin Bowen |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408152913/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |archivedate=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' from 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | title = Asteroids Deluxe Review | author = Nate Ahearn | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-11-29 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65tmzzT9T?url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | archivedate = 2012-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pac-Man]]'' from 1980&lt;ref name="bandainamco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |title=Bandai Namco press release for 25th Anniversary Edition |language=Japanese |quote={{lang|ja|2005年5月22日で生誕25周年を迎えた『パックマン』。}} ("Pac-Man celebrates his 25th anniversary on May 22, 2005", seen in image caption) |author=Namco Bandai Games Inc. |publisher=bandainamcogames.co.jp/ |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230012914/http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |archivedate=2007-12-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also become iconic examples from the action genre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', released in arcades in 1982, also became a classic in the shooter subgenre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''Adventure education''' is the promotion of learning through adventure centered experiences.

Adventure centered experiences can include a wide variety of activities, due to the different ways people experience adventure. Outdoor sports, [[Ropes course|challenge courses]], races, and even indoor activities can be used in adventure education. Adventure education is related to adventure programming, [[adventure therapy]], and [[outdoor education]]. It is an active process rather than a passive process of learning that requires active engagement from the learners as well as the instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Often adventure education is linked to an incorporation of all five senses within the experiences which can heighten the opportunities for learning and retaining information. The learning experiences within adventure education programs are structured for a potential increase in human performance and capacity. Sometimes the adventure lies more in the journey than the destination.  The venture lies in the struggle, not in the prize.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C. Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of adventure ==
Merriam-Webster defines adventure as "an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown [[risks]]". Danger is defined as "exposure or liability to injury, pain, harm, or loss." Danger involves two factors which are perils – the origins of injury or the causes of loss, and [[hazards]] – the conditions that emphasize the chance of injury or loss.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is defined as "potential loss or injury". Risk can be described as "real risk" or "perceived risk"&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[bungee jumping]]; it seems as though there is a high level of risk, but with proper equipment it can be relatively safe. Danger, then is the exposure, or magnitude, of the harm a person may encounter; risk is the probability of that harm. These two variables are filtered through a person's perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.

Consequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as [[adventure racing]] or [[slacklining]]) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport [[rock climbing]], [[skydiving]], or riding a [[roller coaster]]).

== Outcomes of adventure education programming ==
Adventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these theories is "specific transfer" – the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to [[belay]] during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to [[Abseiling|rappelling]]). The second theory is "nonspecific transfer" – the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is "metaphoric transfer" – the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as [[canoeing]] and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program characteristics that contribute to program outcomes ==
There are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical environment ===
Unfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environments&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives them the freedom to experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, R. O., &amp; Bacon, S. B. (1993). The wilderness challenge model. In M. A. Gass (Ed.), Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 11-41). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, R. S. (1993). Therapeutic process of change. In M. A. Gass (Ed.) Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 57-69). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities ===
Rather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS model&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development.&lt;ref&gt;Witman, J. P. (1995). Characteristics of adventure programs valued by adolescents in treatment. Monograph on Youth in the 1990s, 4, 127-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal-setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The "challenge-by-choice" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in.

While the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming.&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision-making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility.

=== Processing ===
Processing is defined as "the sorting and ordering of information" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experience&lt;ref&gt;Luckner, J. L., &amp; Nadler, R. S. (1997). Processing the experience: Strategies to enhance and generalize learning. Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, S. B. (1987). The evolution of the Outward Bound 
process. Greenwich, CT: Outward Bound.&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Mountains Speak for Themselves" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the "Outward Bound Plus" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives.

=== The group ===
Several characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, D., &amp; Putnam, R. (1993). Personal growth through adventure. London, England: David Fulton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instructors ===
Certain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors may be required to have a Bachelors Degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder [https://www.nols.edu/en/coursefinder/courses/wilderness-first-responder-WFR/], American Mountain Guides Single Pitch [https://amga.com/single-pitch-instructor/ Instructor] and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor [https://www.americancanoe.org/page/Become_an_Instructor Certification], among many others.

=== The participant ===
The age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy  is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobilya|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Autonomous Student Experience: Are they too risky for Today's outdoor adventure Program?|url=|journal=SAGE|volume=|pages=353-357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[image:Leonhard-Eißnert-Park 06.jpg|thumb|Forest Adventure Park]]
[[image:Hochseilgarten Isselburg.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park on Poles]]
[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==
{{multiple issues|
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===

[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Bourgeois tragedy''' (German: ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'') is a form of [[tragedy]] that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the [[the Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeois|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see [[domestic tragedy]]), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: [[George Lillo]]'s ''[[The London Merchant]]; or, [[the History of George Barnwell]]'', which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first ''tragédie bourgeoise'' was ''Sylvie'' by [[Paul Landois]], which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by [[Denis Diderot]]: ''Le fils naturel'' was first staged in 1757 and ''Le père de famille'' in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of [[comedy|comedies]], classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. [[Aristotle]] articulates this idea in ''ars poetica'' (''The Poetics'') and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German [[Martin Opitz]], perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as [[Andreas Gryphius]]' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King [[Charles I of England]]), [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]] (the wife of [[Theseus]], a mythical king of [[Athens]]) or [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]], serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'', it was especially successful.  Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany. However, [[Christian Leberecht Martini]]'s drama ''Rhynsolt und Sapphira'' is slightly older. Lessing's ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie''. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are ''Die Soldaten'' by [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] (1776) and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' (1784). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503446347|title=Exemplarity and mediocrity : the art of the average from bourgeois tragedy to realism|last=1968-|first=Fleming, Paul,|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804769983|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=503446347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

'''Cat play and toys''' incorporates predatory games of "play aggression". [[Cat]]s' behaviors when playing are similar to hunting behaviors. These activities allow kittens and younger cats to grow and acquire cognitive and [[motor skills]], and to [[socialize]] with other cats. Cat play behavior can be either solitary (with toys or other objects) or social (with animals and people). They can play with a multitude of toys ranging from strings, to small furry toys resembling what would be prey (e.g. mice), to plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;ASPCA. Animal Behavior Center.

Object play for animals (in this case, cats) is the use of inanimate objects by the animal to express play behaviour. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jkiTQ8dIIHsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=cat+play+behaviour+and+toys&amp;ots=08zc2X7z7u&amp;sig=KA3ewyI75AWt7asz0ZdeS9KcGTg#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20play%20behaviour%20and%20toys&amp;f=false|title=Animal Play: Evolutionary, Comparative and Ecological Perspectives|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|last2=Byers|first2=John A.|date=1998-06-04|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521586566|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of pet domestic cats, humans normally provide them with purchased, human-made toys such as toy mice. When it comes to non-domestic, wild cats, they may use several objects in the wilderness as their toys including sticks, leaves, rocks, feathers, etc. Actions that cats may carry out as this play behaviour include throwing the toy object, chasing, biting, capturing, etc. as they might do with a real source of prey. Engaging in object play helps young cats to practice these skills that they need as they grow into adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Nature of play==

=== Play in kittens ===
Play in cats is a behaviour that is brought about during growth from the kitten stage onward. Some important aspects of this play behaviour for the development of kittens in to adult cats include motor development, social behaviour and cognitive development. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendoza|first=Diana, L.|last2=Ramirez|first2=J. Martin|date=1987|title=Play in kittens (felis domesticus) and its association with cohesion and aggression|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2FBF03330067.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|volume=25 (1)|pages=27-30|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are different types of play that develop at different stages during the development and growth of a kitten. The first play behaviours observed in kittens include things like approaching, pawing and holding onto each other. Following this stage in their development, kittens begin to show an interest in inanimate objects and prey behaviour. This is the development of their nonsocial behaviour in which they become more independent and begin to practice predatory/hunting behaviour. Play behaviour in kittens is also important in providing them with physical exercise as they are growing, as well as providing a means of interacting with other members of their litter to keep strong social bonds among them. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Meredith|date=1974|title=Social play in the domestic cat|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/14-1-427.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAiowggImBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIXMIICEwIBADCCAgwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMsVDNXzipXXmwpeLNAgEQgIIB3UakpGb4PwGuLER5eb3AfDS8oVddvKgZJcG2SfpEePTxhXQ3rUbDZ_4mn1XQkbZMBD5AAR9qUlujggP7sdJWQrrJ1xMAr7TZSu9_UD-9V_NkCWCQANMywWVlV4I44n7syYvCTtJgZcVkkW2S2578udMGqId88ZeKOFvGTKgmGSzUyVnE-LqdGcxsnem_1mtTL5ZQS9NMHiftNRi81zFwXJ8CG4MiMUxduxvo3sIQel2tSZuZcn_594bNZMkJdp9uGlzDHtxHSsHAdcWhIlkBugB8ozw3LvgxmTRzxU9ZsNrtsnci0_qnpvRSFuUOw5qLBmnSEJlPKH1o6YLf21AtZdfdhCGZv1qPso4CJh6755xEybPFzI2Iu23R2cYwwhGAYwg4vN4U_FDIpz38JzeI8VSMhL7IKFgwnG5gUEMW5DtShUaMbqN05kjRZUvAkBLzjzPHYFi5J82KPMWdvl_XRvzFASEfVTC8RT71YXVxgwEH8NjPoDaW7mupoqrHIEW5yzBV5Bdw4ZMMjbevwN9ghoqG9QcKDzNOPupn3sOKbvHERRhEO81pTNQZ-1AmmoVWtkXsqdEYeO8JXYhxJErocDcOLJutHln06D-tzw5SNPkX0cYrUKJcYLebJIYu0g|journal=American Zoology|volume=14|pages=427-436|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social play is important between litter-mates since this is the main source of play for kittens in early life with little alternative to other means of play. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kittens are limited in room for exploring for other means of play, so engaging in this social play behaviour is important until they have access to other play objects such as toys. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Predation===
[[File:Predatorycat ubt.jpeg|thumb|Predation]]
Since cats are meat-eating [[Predation|predators]], nearly all cat games are predatory games.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Bradshaw 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predation|Prey]] are fearful of predators. Predators often encounter prey that attempt to escape predation. Prey that move towards the cat with confidence may be exhibiting an aggressive defensive posture. Cats often play with [[toy]]s that behave more like fearful prey trying to escape than toys that mimic more confrontational prey.

===Success rate===
Success rate is important in play. A cat that catches its prey every time soon gets bored, and a cat that never gets it just loses interest. The ideal hunting success rate is around 1 in 3 to 1 in 6. Capturing prey at this rate generally maximises a cat's interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precautions===
Play is about predatory behaviour, and a highly excited cat can cause minor injuries in the excitement of the moment. With most cats, it is wise to keep playthings at least 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8") away from fingers or eyes and avoid encouraging a cat to eat inedible toys. If playing with a human's bare hands, a cat will generally resist using its claws or biting too hard, but a cat that becomes extremely excited may accidentally inflict injuries to its human playmate in the form of light scratches or small puncture wounds from biting too hard. Cats' claws and mouths can contain bacteria that can lead to infection, so it is wise to clean and treat any wounds with an antiseptic solution and seek professional medical services if there is reason to believe that the wound has become infected.

===Food===
Catching and [[eating]] are two closely related but separate activities. Domestic cats often store caught [[food]] for eating later. Eating happens when the game is over, so incorporating food into hunting games tends to end the interest in play. Hidden treats helps engage cat's senses such as sense of smell and can be a form of play which enables them to utilize their searching skills. This idea of treats linked with play helps cats form the association that treats signify happy behaviour.

== Defining motor aspects of play ==
There are several different motor patterns associated with the play behaviour of cats and they have different roles in the social context. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Meredith|date=1974|title=Social play in the domestic cat|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/14-1-427.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAiowggImBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIXMIICEwIBADCCAgwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMsVDNXzipXXmwpeLNAgEQgIIB3UakpGb4PwGuLER5eb3AfDS8oVddvKgZJcG2SfpEePTxhXQ3rUbDZ_4mn1XQkbZMBD5AAR9qUlujggP7sdJWQrrJ1xMAr7TZSu9_UD-9V_NkCWCQANMywWVlV4I44n7syYvCTtJgZcVkkW2S2578udMGqId88ZeKOFvGTKgmGSzUyVnE-LqdGcxsnem_1mtTL5ZQS9NMHiftNRi81zFwXJ8CG4MiMUxduxvo3sIQel2tSZuZcn_594bNZMkJdp9uGlzDHtxHSsHAdcWhIlkBugB8ozw3LvgxmTRzxU9ZsNrtsnci0_qnpvRSFuUOw5qLBmnSEJlPKH1o6YLf21AtZdfdhCGZv1qPso4CJh6755xEybPFzI2Iu23R2cYwwhGAYwg4vN4U_FDIpz38JzeI8VSMhL7IKFgwnG5gUEMW5DtShUaMbqN05kjRZUvAkBLzjzPHYFi5J82KPMWdvl_XRvzFASEfVTC8RT71YXVxgwEH8NjPoDaW7mupoqrHIEW5yzBV5Bdw4ZMMjbevwN9ghoqG9QcKDzNOPupn3sOKbvHERRhEO81pTNQZ-1AmmoVWtkXsqdEYeO8JXYhxJErocDcOLJutHln06D-tzw5SNPkX0cYrUKJcYLebJIYu0g|journal=American Zoology|volume=14|pages=427-436|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Pouncing is one of these motor patterns in which it is used to initiate play through physical contact. Chasing and horizontal leaping is an example of a motor pattern that may be used by a cat to end play. The movement of a cat's tail during play and the varying rates at which the cat may move its tail can even be a useful indicator of its level of playfulness. There are patterns of belly-up and stand-up actions that are engaged in by kittens in which seem to show that they prefer to engage in physical contact play in terms of their social role among other kittens.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Influence of hunger on cat behaviour ==
Hunger has been shown to give an increase in intensity in the play behaviour of cats, and a decrease in fear which they show towards larger-sized toys. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/science/article/pii/S0168159197001366|title=Memorial University Libraries - Proxy Login|website=www-sciencedirect-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect that hunger has on play behaviour may be attributed to how experienced of a hunter the cat is. It is not expected that a cat who has a higher level of hunting experience would show this increased intensity of their play behaviour when hungry. Instead, they are more likely to show more predatory behaviour. In the case of cats with a lower level of hunting experience, they show this increased play behaviour since they are not able to engage in actual predatory activities and instead show predatory behaviours towards toys when hungry as an experienced hunter would show towards actual prey when hungry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''comedy of manners''' is a form of [[comedy]] that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through [[stock characters]] such as the ''[[miles gloriosus]]'' ("boastful soldier") in [[ancient Greek comedy]] or the [[fop]] and [[rake (character)|rake]] of English [[Restoration comedy]], which is sometimes used as a synonym for "comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), which satirized the [[Victorian morality]] of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.

The comedy of manners was first developed in the [[New Comedy]] period of [[ancient Greek comedy]] and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright [[Menander]]. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|ancient Roman playwrights]], such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the [[Renaissance]]. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright [[Molière]], who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' in plays such as ''[[L'École des femmes]]'' ([''The School for Wives''], 1662), ''[[Tartuffe]]'' ([''The Imposter''], 1664), and ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' ([''The Misanthrope''], 1666).

== Early examples ==
The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. [[Horace]]'s [[Satires (Horace)|Satire 1.9]] is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' might be considered the first comedy of manners In [[England]], but the genre really flourished during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. [[Restoration comedy]], which was influenced by [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[comedy of humours]], made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time.  The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of [[William Wycherley]] (''[[The Country Wife]]'', 1675) and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] (''[[The Way of the World]]'', 1700). In the late 18th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', 1773) and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (''[[The Rivals]]'', 1775; ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', 1777) revived the form.

The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists [[Noël Coward]] (''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', 1925) and [[Somerset Maugham]] and the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], as well as various [[British sitcom]]s.  The ''[[Carry On film]]s'' are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners 
style.

== Twentieth-century examples ==

The term ''[[comedy of menace]]'', which British drama critic [[Irving Wardle]] based on the subtitle of ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'' (1958), by [[David Campton]], is a jocular play-on-words derived from the "comedy of manners" (''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent).&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Susan Hollis Merritt, ''Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter'' (Durham &amp; London, 1990: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinter's play ''[[The Homecoming]]'' has been described as a mid-twentieth-century "comedy of manners".&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' (1999), [[David Mamet]] chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme).  Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class.  Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.

Other contemporary examples include [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Room with a View]]'', [[Barbara Pym]]'s ''[[Excellent Women]]'', [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s ''[[As Bees in Honey Drown]]'', ''[[The Country Club (play)|The Country Club]]'', ''[[The Little Dog Laughed (play)|The Little Dog Laughed]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'' by [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and [[Jimmy Perry]], and the [[Jeeves|Jeeves and Wooster]] series by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. The television program ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.

Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===

{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger.

In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages. This is one of... Golden Age (1938–1955)Superhero |publisher=Comics.ha.com |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile.

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and "darker and edgier" comic books and jump start the [[Modern Age of Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sequart.org/magazine/20743/1986-british-invasion-part-3-neil-gaiman-swamp-thing/ | title= The British Invasion, Part 3: Neil Gaiman &amp; Swamp Thing | author= Peter Sanderson | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= ''Sequart Organization''| accessdate=September 28, 2014 }} May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writers included [[Alan Moore]], famous for his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Marvelman]]'', and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/ Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics], by Douglas Wolk in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Gaiman]] with ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' mythos and ''[[Books of Magic]]''; [[Warren Ellis]], creator of ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''; and others such as [[Mark Millar]], creator of ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]''. The comic book series ''[[Hellblazer]]'', which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician [[John Constantine]], paved the way for British writers such as [[Jamie Delano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html| title= The Writers of Hellblazer: Interviews with Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis | publisher= Tabula Rasa| accessdate=2014-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the [[Royal Mail]], released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series.&lt;ref name="Stamps"&gt;

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">A '''fishing expedition''' is an informal, pejorative term for a non-specific search for information, especially incriminating information. It is most frequently organized by policing authorities.

In the UK, [[Abu Hamza]] and Yaser al-Sirri,&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Norton-Taylor]] and [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]] "Police hold Islam cleric in 'fishing expedition'", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Cliff Richard]],&lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey Levi and Richard Kay, "He hid himself away for two years", ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Davidson]],&lt;ref&gt; Caroline Jowett, "No further action by Jim Davidson Review", ''[[Daily Express]]'', 18 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and the late [[Edward Heath]]&lt;ref&gt; Patrick Sawer, "Prejudicial Heath Inquiry to be referred to Police Watchdog", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 October 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; were each subjected to this tactic.

In Sir Cliff Richard's case, the police 'tipped off' the BBC that a search was imminent. A BBC helicopter filmed as five police cars arrived at the singer's home and eight officers searched the premises, 'all of it broadcast in dramatic pictures instantly sent around the world'. Sir Cliff was unaware of this, being away on holiday.&lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey Levi and Richard Kay, "He hid himself away for two years", ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Former friends of the late prime minister Edward Heath complained that Mike Veale, Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, had mounted a 'fishing expedition' in an 'unsatisfactory and prejudicial' investigation costing £1.5 million which had turned up 'no convincing evidence' that Heath had ever sexually assaulted anyone, according to [[Lord Hunt of Wirral]].&lt;ref&gt; Patrick Sawer, "Prejudicial Heath Inquiry to be referred to Police Watchdog", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 October 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[board game]]s and [[video game]]s provide their own fictional setting, or are set in fictional settings defined by other media such as [[literature]] or [[film]]. '''Fluff''', in the context of such gaming fiction, refers to information that provides setting and context for the game.

By definition, fluff is never part of the proper game rules. As such, fluff has no impact on gameplay and can technically be ignored by the players without breaking the game or its rules; it could arguably be described as 'soft rules'. As a result, the concept may not be applicable for [[role-playing games]] where the rules are at the discretion of the [[game master]] and implied, contextual or otherwise 'soft' rules may be deemed valid and binding.

In the context of fiction, fluff is essentially synonymous with '[[Canon (fiction)|Canon]]', i.e. the body of all fiction deemed to officially shape and define the fictional setting. It often takes the form of [[short stories]] or background information found in rulebooks and game supplements, but can take any form. In highly developed, popular settings which have evolved beyond gaming, fluff may include anything from gaming supplements such as [[sourcebook]]s to [[novels]] or even [[movies]].

By contrast, in the same context the term [[blurb]] is typically used for brief explanatory texts (for individual gaming pieces etc.). Where they do not provide gaming rules for their subject, blurbs also fall under the definition of the fluff.

{{Literature}}
'''Genre studies''' is an academic subject which studies '''genre theory''' as a branch of general [[critical theory]] in several different fields, including the literary or artistic, linguistic, or rhetorical.

Literary genre studies is a [[Structuralism#Structuralism in literary theory and literary criticism|structuralist]] approach to the study of [[genre]] and genre theory in [[literary theory]], [[film theory]], and other [[cultural theory|cultural theories]]. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the [[narratology|telling of a story]] and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or [[Code (semiotics)|semiotic codes]]) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.

Linguistic genre studies is best described by two schools of literary genre, the [[Systemic Functional Linguistics]] or "SFL", scholars of this school believe that language structure is an integral part of a text's social context and function.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, Anis and Mary Jo Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.'' Colorado: Parlor Press and WAC Clearinghouse, 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres usefulness in pedagogy.

[[English for Specific Purposes]] or "ESP" is another school of genre studies that examines the pedagogical implications of genre. ESP scholars focus on how genre can help non-native English speakers on how to use the language and its conventions through the application of genre analysis, the identification of discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in the specific discourse community, etc for bringing changes in epideictic schemata.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Paul Gee|author2=Michael Handford|title=The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2T6-LHp8T8C&amp;pg=PA242|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-67292-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one is Rhetorical Genre Studies or "RGS" studies genre as social action. RGS emerged from Carolyn R. Miller's article "Genre as Social Action".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary and linguistic branches==

===Systemic functional linguistics===
{{main article|Systemic functional linguistics}}
Systemic functional linguistics scholars believe that language is organized within cultures based on cultural ideologies. The "systemic" of SFL refers to the system as a whole, in which linguistic choices are made. SFL is based largely on the work of Michael Halliday, who believed that individuals make linguistic choices based on the ideologies of the systems that those individuals inhabit. For Halliday, there is a "network of meanings" within a culture, that constitutes the "social semiotic" of that culture. This "social semiotic" is encoded and maintained by the discourse system of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Michael. ''Language as Social Semiotic''. London: Edward Arnold, 1978. p.100, 13&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday, contexts in which texts are produced recur, in what he calls "situation types." People raised within a specific culture become accustomed to the "situation types" that occur within that culture, and are more easily able to maneuver through the "situation types" within that culture than people who were not brought up within it.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.29-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday's approach to cultural context in the formation of recurrent "situation types" influenced other scholars, such as J.R. Martin. Martin led the SFL pedagogical approach, which emphasized the role of context in text formation. Martin and his associates believed that process-based approaches to education ignored the cultural boundaries of texts, and privileged middle- and upper- class students at the expense of students from lower-class backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p.32&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin and other SFL scholars, an explicit focus on genre in literature would help literacy teaching. Focusing on genre reveals the contexts that influences texts, and teaches those contexts to students, so that they can create texts that are culturally informed.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction.'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their genre work in schools, Martin and his associates developed a definition of genre as a "staged, goal-oriented, social process."&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=J.R.|last2=Rose|first2=David|title=Genre relations: Mapping Culture|date=2008|publisher=Equinox Pub.|location=London|isbn=978-1845530488|page=6|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Martinian genre model, genres are staged because they accomplish tasks that require multiple steps; they are goal-oriented because their users are motivated to see the completion of the stages to the end; and they are social because users address their texts to specific audiences.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Rose"/&gt;

===English for Specific Purposes===
{{main article|English for Specific Purposes}}
English for Specific Purposes scholarship has been around since the 1960s, but ESP scholars did not begin using genre as a pedagogical approach until the 1980s, when [[John Swales]] published ''Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings'', in which Swales laid out the methodological approach that brought together ESP and genre analysis.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.41"/&gt; Swales identified two characteristics of ESP genre analysis: its focus on academic research in English and its use of genre analysis for applied ends.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.41-42&lt;/ref&gt; ESP focuses on specific genres within spheres of activity, such as the medical profession, but it also focuses on the broader concept of communicative purposes within fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

English for Specific Purposes shares some characteristics with SFL studies. Both believe that linguistic features are connected to social context and function, and both aim to help disadvantaged students grasp the system in which texts are created so that they can create similar texts, by teaching them the relationship between language and social function. Both try to accomplish their goals by teaching specific genres to underprivileged users.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also some important differences between ESP and SFL. Whereas SFL scholars focus on teaching basic genre structures to primary and secondary school students, ESP scholars are focused on teaching Professional and Academic disciplinary genres to University- and graduate-level students. ESP students tend to be more bound to discursive genre subjects, within very particular contexts. ESP focuses on micro-level genres and contexts, whereas SFL focuses on macro-level contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS)===

Rhetorical Genre Studies (a term coined by Aviva Freedman) scholars examine genre as typified social action, as ways of acting based on recurrent social situations. This founding principle for RGS was taken from Carolyn R. Miller's essay "Genre as Social Action," which was published in 1984.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Genre as Social Action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 70 (1984):151-167&lt;/ref&gt; In her article, Miller examines Frank Lloyd Bitzer's  notion of exigence as a reaction to social situations, and Kenneth Burke's notion of "motive" as human action.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Using Bitzer, particularly, Miller believes it is possible to examine exigence as "an external cause of discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action." p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she is able to view situations as social constructions. Genres are typified ways of responding to recurring social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. "Genre as Social Action."&lt;/ref&gt;

RGS scholarship has evolved beyond Miller's founding definition of genre. Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas Huckin begin with the notion that genre is knowledge foundation, and argue that genres embody communities' knowledge and ways of acting.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.78"/&gt; For Berkenkotter and Huckin, genre becomes a way of navigating social activity. As such, it is dynamic, because the conditions of social activity are always in flux. Recurrence, they claim, involves variation.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Berkenkotter and Huckin redefine genre as social cognition.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.79"/&gt;

The notion of "uptake" is also integral to RGS scholars' understanding of genre. Anne Freadman uses uptake to describe the ways in which genres interact with each other in her articles "Uptake" and "Anyone for Tennis?".&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre:An Introduction''. p.83-84&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the game of tennis to explain the ways genres interact. Tennis players, she says, do not exchange tennis balls, they exchange shots. Each shot only has meaning within the game, its rules, and the context of the game being play.&lt;ref&gt;Freadman, Anne. "Anyone for Tennis." ''Genre and the New Rhetoric''. Ed. Aviva Freedman and Peter Medway. Bristol: Taylor and Francis, 1994. p.43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Shots are meaningful because they take place in a game. The game is meaningful because it takes place within "ceremonials." Thus, the final at Wimbledon provides a different context than a game between friends. Genres are the games that take place within ceremonials, and shots are utterances, or verbal exchanges. We cannot really understand a text without understanding the ceremonial in which it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; "Uptake" is the illocutionary response elicited by particular situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Devitt's research has further complicated the RGS landscape. In ''Writing Genres'', Devitt distinguishes between the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets." The "context of genres" is the overall set of genres available in a culture. A "genre repertoire" refers to the set of genres that a specific group uses to achieve its purposes. "Genre systems" are the sets of genres that function within an activity system. Finally, "genre sets" are more loosely defined sets of genres that function within an activity system, but only define a limited range of actions within that system.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.87&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if we were to take a courtroom as an activity system, a genre set could be defined as only those genres used by the judge. Studying the "context of genres," "genre repertoires," "genre systems," and "genre sets" enables researchers to study the relationships and power structures of activity systems.&lt;ref name="Reif. p.87"/&gt;

==Generic conventions==
Conventions are usual indicators such as phrases, themes, quotations, or explanations that readers expect to find in a certain genre. They could be considered "[[stereotypes]]" of that genre. For example, [[Science fiction]] is expected to be set in the future, and have futuristic events, technological advances, and futuristic ideas. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] is expected to contain a story about people who could pass as real, struggling through real-life situations and/or real world events, etc.

Critic Paul Alpers explains that literary conventions are like meeting places where past and present writers "come together" to determine the form a convention should take in a particular literary instance (work). In practical terms, this coming together is a matter of the present writer consulting the work of predecessors, but Alpers wants to connote the sense of active negotiation and accommodation that takes place between the writer and the genre he or she is working in (a genre defined by other people). According to Alpers, a misconception persists in modern criticism that literary convention is an "arbitrary and inflexible practice, established by widespread usage and imposed from without." Convention in this sense is the "antithesis of the personal and individual"; it is "felt to constrain the [writer]." Alpers reconceptualizes literary convention as something "constitutive and enabling." For him, generic conventions are "not fixed procedures imposed by impersonal tradition;" rather, they are the living "usages of other [writers]," "the shared practice of those who come together." Thinking of generic conventions as a practice shared by many users, allows later writers to exercise the same degree of control over convention as those who predated them. Far from constraining writers, convention provides flexibility to preserve certain aspects of a genre and transform others. Convention in this sense enables "individual expression, because the [writer] is seen as responsive to, even when challenging, his predecessors and fellows."&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, Paul. "Lycidas and Modern Criticism." ''English Literary History'' 49.2 (1982): 468-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre theorist [[David Fishelov]] also deals with generic conventions—he calls them "generic rules"—in elaborating his explanatory metaphor of "literary genres as social institutions" in the book ''Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory''. Fishelov, like Alpers, sees generic conventions as an inescapably "vital part of the literary communicative situation," linking present and past writers to each other, as well as to readers. Established conventions are "a challenge, or a horizon, against which the writer and his reader have to define themselves." The writer may respond to this challenge by "stretch[ing] the generic rules."&lt;ref name=Metaphors&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishelov|first=David|title=Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory.|year=1993|publisher=The Pennsylvania State UP|location=University Park, PA|pages=85–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishelov draws his metaphor of genre as social institution from a passage in René Welleck and Austin Warren's ''Theory of Literature'':

:The literary kind [genre] is an ‘institution'—as Church, University, or State is an institution. It exists not as an animal exists or even as a building, chapel, library, or capital, but as an institution exists. One can work through, express oneself through, existing institutions, create new ones, or get on, so far as possible, without sharing in politics or rituals; one can also join, but then reshape institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Welleck, René and Austin Warren. ''Theory of Literature''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc., 1942. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

This formulation ascribes agency to actors within social institutions. In the same way institutions like churches, universities, and states organize social actors to accomplish collective social purposes, literary genres organize relationships between writers and readers to accomplish communicative purposes, which change over time. Genres are not static, but rather, like social institutions, persist through the constant renovation of their conventions by individuals. Fishelov is particularly helpful in theorizing the role of the reader in alternately constraining and motivating generic change:

:[T]he reader demands compliance with the established generic conventions so that he can integrate the new text, but at the same time he expects the writer to manipulate these established conventions so that the new text is more than a tedious repetition of the generic tradition.&lt;ref name="Metaphors" /&gt;

Reader expectations operate as both a constraint on the writer and a "latent demand for innovation." The writer "is expected to manipulate the existing conventions and to carry them (at least) one step further…. From the writer's perspective, the generic convention is a model to follow but also a challenge to overcome." Fishelov explains that writers choose or are compelled to manipulate prevailing conventions for a variety of aesthetic and thematic reasons.

==History of genre theory==
Genre theory or genre studies got underway with the [[Greeks]].  The Greeks felt that the type of person an author was would be directly responsible for the type of poetry they wrote.  The Greeks also believed that certain metrical forms were suited only to certain genres. [[Aristotle]] said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have, then, a natural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythm—and starting with these instincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their improvisations.  Poetry then split into two kinds according to the poet's nature.  For the more serious poets represented the noble deeds of noble men, while those of a less exalted nature represented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others wrote hymns and eulogies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is all based on [[Plato]]'s mimetic principle.  Exalted people will, in imitation of exaltation, write about exalted people doing exalted things, and vice versa with the "lower" types (Farrell, 383). Genre was not a black-and-white issue even for Aristotle, who recognized that though the "[[Iliad]]" is an epic it can be considered a tragedy as well, both because of its tone as well as the nobility of its characters.  However, most of the Greek critics were less acutely aware—if aware at all—of the inconsistencies in this system.  For these critics, there was no room for ambiguity in their literary taxonomy because these categories were thought to have innate qualities that could not be disregarded.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] carried on the Greek tradition of literary criticism.  The Roman critics were quite happy to continue on in the assumption that there were essential differences between the types of [[poetry]] and [[drama]].  There is much evidence in their works that Roman writers themselves saw through these ideas and understood genres and how they function on a more advanced level.  However, it was the critics who left their mark on Roman literary criticism, and they were not innovators.

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], when the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] system took over literary criticism, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres.  This is most likely because of [[Christianity]]'s affinity for Platonic concepts.  This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.

===Enlightenment age===
At the end of the 18th century, the theory of genre based on [[classicism|classical]] thought began to unravel beneath the intellectual chafing of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  The introduction of the [[printing press]] brought texts to a larger audience.  Then [[pamphlet]]s and [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] began to diffuse information even farther, and a greater number of less privileged members of society became literate and began to express their views.  Suddenly authors of both "[[High culture|high]]" and "[[Low culture|low]]" culture were now competing for the same audience.  This worked to destabilize the classical notions of genre, while still drawing attention to genre because new genres like the [[novel]] were being generated (Prince, 455).

[[John Locke|Locke]], in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), had reduced data to its smallest part: the simple idea derived from sense.  However, as the science of cognition became more precise it was shown that even this simple idea derived from sense was itself divisible.  This new information prompted David Hartley to write in his ''Observation on Man'' (1749), &lt;blockquote&gt;How far the Number of Orders may go is impossible to say.  I see no Contradiction in supposing it infinite, and a great Difficulty in stopping at any particular Size. (Prince, 456). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The possibility of an infinite number of types alarmed [[theology|theologians]] of the time because their assumption was that rigorously applied [[empiricism]] would uncover the underlying divine nature of creation, and now it appeared that rigorously applied empiricism would only uncover an ever-growing number of types and subsequent sub-types.

In order to re-establish the divine in categorization, the new taxonomical system of [[aesthetics]] arose.  This system offered first beauty, and then the sublime as the taxonomical device.  The problem with Aesthetics was that it assumed the divine and thus the sublime must underlie all these categories, and thus, the ugly would become beautiful at some point.  The paradox is glaring.

===Evolution===
Ever since the late 18th century literary critics have been trying to find a theory of genre that would be more commensurate with the realities of individual texts within genres.  The evolution of genre took many twists and turns through the 19th and 20th centuries. It was heavily influenced by the [[deconstruction]]ist thought and the concept of [[relativism|relativity]].  In 1980, the instability engendered by these two new modes of thought came to a head in a paper written by [[Jacques Derrida]] titled, "The Law of Genre."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." ''Critical Inquiry'' 7.1 (1980):55-81&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article Derrida first articulates the idea that individual texts participate in rather than belong to certain genres.  He does this by demonstrating that the "mark of genre" is not itself a member of a genre or type.  Thus, the very characteristic that signifies genre defies classification.  However, at the end of this essay, Derrida hints at what might be a more fruitful direction for genre theory.  "There, that is the whole of it, it is only what 'I,' so that say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see.  In sum, the law.  The law summoning: what 'I' can sight and what 'I' can say that I sight in this site of a recitation where I/we is."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "The Law of Genre." p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  By which Derrida means that not only is taxonomy a [[subjectivity|subjective]] sport, but due to this very fact, ''the place and time the taxonomical act takes place'' deserves further study.

Then, in 1986, Ralph Cohen published a paper in response to Derrida's thoughts titled "History and Genre."  In this article Cohen argued that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;genre concepts in theory and in practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons.  And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category.  Genres are open categories.  Each member alters the genre by adding, contradicting, or changing constituents, especially those of members most closely related to it.  The process by which genres are established always involves the human need for distinction and interrelation.  Since the purposes of critics who establish genres vary, it is self-evident that the same texts can belong to different groupings of genres and serve different generic purposes. (Cohen, 204)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Genre Evolution in RGS''

RGS scholars largely agree that while genres are indeed dynamic and constantly evolving entities, they are difficult to change. [[Amy Devitt]] describes this bind, as she considers a genre to be "both the product and the process that creates it" (580).&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Generalizing about Genre: New Conceptions of an Old Concept." College Composition and Communication. 44.4 (1993): 573-586. Web. JSTOR. 22 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; To Devitt, genres not only respond to recurrent situations, but they construct them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, Amy. "Integrating Rhetorical and Literary Theories of Genre." College English. 62.6 (2000): 696-718.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon makes theorizing genre evolution challenging.  [[Carolyn R. Miller]] even cautions against describing genre change as "evolution," as evolution implies progress.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Do Genres Evolve?" Genre 2012: Rethinking Genre 20 Years Later." Carleton University, Ottawa Canada. 27 Jun 2012. Keynote Address&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many RGS scholars have theorized how genres change. [[Jo Ann Yates]] and [[Wanda Orlikowski]] offer that "one person cannot single-handedly effect the change of an institutionalized structure; other relevant participants must adopt and reinforce the attempted change for it to be implemented and sustained in practice" (108).&lt;ref&gt;"Genre Systems: Chronos and Kairos in Communicative Action" The Rhetoric of Ideology and Ideology of Genre. Eds. Richard Coe, Lorelei Lingard, and Tatiana Teslenko. Cresskill, NJ, Hampton Press, 2002. 103-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Yates and Orlikowski then describe how genres evolve: they claim that genres change when a kairotic moment presents itself, and the rhetor, instead of choosing to employ the "genre most appropriately enacted" tries a new method of which the audience accepts as new way of responding to the recurrent situation (119). See [[kairos]]. [[Natasha Artemeva]] has made similar observations based on an eight-year ethnographic survey that followed engineering students from academia and into the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Artemeva, Natasha. "Stories of Becoming: A Study of Novice Engineers Learning Genres of Their Profession." Genre in a Changing World. Eds. Charles Bazerman, Adair Bonini, and Débora Figueiredo.  West Lafayette, Indiana, Parlor Press, 2009. 158-178. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemeva observed two of her subjects impact the evolution of workplace genres when a kairotic moment presented itself (164).  Yet these former student's success in changing the workplace genre also depended on three individually acquired skills: 1) "cultural capital", 2) "domain content expertise", and 3) "agency in the rhetor's ability" to not only see when a kairotic moment presented itself, but "to also seize the opportunity" (167). [[Thomas Helscher]] is not as optimistic; he writes, the "rhetorical constitution of [a] discourse community operates as a counterweight to the process of community growth and change" (30) and argues that the "transformation of the fundamental generic conventions by which communities constitutes themselves...is paradigmatic of the process of social transformation" (32).&lt;ref&gt;Helscher, Thomas P.

==Current state of genre theory==
The definition of genre from [http://www.dictionary.com dictionary.com] is "a class or category of artistic endeavor having a particular form, context, technique, or the like."  Although it seems that genre should be easy to define, the finer points of textual categorization are not yet established.

Genres, according to [[Daniel Chandler]], create order to simplify the mass of available information.  Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos.  [[Jane Feuer]] has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups.  The first is aesthetic.  By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization.  The second classification method is [[ritual]].  Ritual uses its own culture to help classify.  If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system.  The common taxonomic method is [[ideology|ideological]].  This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies.  The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.

[[Amy J. Devitt]] focuses on the [[rhetoric]]al approach to genre.  Scholars generally recognize the restrictions  placed on works that have been classified as a certain genre.  However, viewing genre as a rhetorical device gives the author and the reader more freedom and "allows for choices."  Genres are not free-standing entities, but are actually intimately connected and interactive amongst themselves.  Rhetorical theory of genre recognizes that genres are generated by authors, readers, publishers, and the entire array of social forces that act upon a work at every stage of its production.

This recognition does not make the taxonomy of texts easy.  Chandler points out that very few works have all the characteristics of the genre in which they participate.  Also, due to the interrelatedness of genres, none of them is clearly defined at the edges, but rather fade into one another.  Genre works to promote organization, but there is no absolute way to classify works, and thus genre is still problematic and its theory still evolving.

Moreover, the metagenre as a concept has been an important point to study. According to Giltrow, metagenre is "situated language about situated language". Metagenres such as institutional guidelines can be "ruling out certain kinds of expression, endorsing others", constraining and enabling. The concept of metagenre also provides a valuable way to understand the dynamics of institutional interrelations between genres. In the mental health discourse, for example, has been demonstrated the metageneric function of the American Psychiatric Association's (DSM) for standardizing and mediating the localized epistemological communicative practices of psychiatrists.

==Functions and limits==

Genre began as an absolute classification system in ancient Greece. [[Poetry]], [[prose]] and [[performance]] had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. This classical system worked well as long as the arts were largely directed by nobility and rich patrons. A common understanding of meaning was handy in knowing what the employer expected, and the crowds understood it.

During the Enlightenment period in 18th century Europe, this system of [[patronage]] began to change.  A merchant [[middle class]] began to emerge with money to spend and time to spend it.  Artists could venture away from classical genres and try new ways to attract paying patrons. "Comedy" could now mean Greek metered comedy, or physical camp, or some other type of experience. Artists were also free to use their mediums to express the human condition in a way that was not possible under single patronage, or at least not profitable. Art could be used to reflect and comment on the lives of ordinary people. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. In fact, as far back as ancient Greece, new art forms were emerging that called for the evolution of genre, for example the "tragicomedy."

Unfortunately, genre does have its limitations. Our world has grown so much that it is difficult to absolutely classify something. Information overlaps, and a single book can encompass elements of several genres. For example, a book might be classified as [[fiction]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[science fiction]] and [[African American literature]] all at once.
	 
Genre suffers from the same ills of any classification system. Humans are pattern-seeking beings; we like to create order out of the chaos of the universe. However, when we forget that our order is imposed, often arbitrarily, over a universe of unique experiences, the merit of the individual gets lost. If a system of classification, like genre, is then used to assign value judgments, we allow our preconceptions about the whole to influence our opinion of the individual. Genre is useful as long as we remember that it is a helpful tool, to be reassessed and scrutinized, and to weigh works on their unique merit as well as their place within the genre.

A simple example of the inherent meaning in an art form is that of a [[western movie]] where two men face each other on a dusty and empty road; one wears a black hat, the other white. Independent of any external meaning, there is no way to tell what the situation might mean, but due to the long development of the "western" genre, it is clear to the informed audience that they are watching a gunfight showdown between a [[villain|bad guy]] and a [[hero|good guy]].

It has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

Genre studies have perhaps gained the most recognition in [[film theory]], where the study of genre directly contrasts with [[auteur theory]], which privileges the director's role in crafting a movie.

== In social communities ==
There is something more about genre theory, and to that effect it is necessary to propose Kristen H. Perry's definition. Written (textual) genres are social constructions that represent specific purposes for reading and writing within different social activities, created by social groups who need them to perform certain things. They change over time, reflecting essential shifts in social function performed by that text. Genres also represent constellations of textual attributes: some attributes are necessary and other attributes are optional.

Another definition which shows the different aspects of genre theory is Miller who defines genres as "typified rhetorical actions" that respond to recurring situations and become instantiated in groups' behaviors. Genre evolves as "a form of social knowledge—a mutual construing of objects, events, interests and purposes that not only links them but makes them what they are: an objectified social need". This view sees genres not as static forms but, rather, as "forms of  ways of being ... frames for social action ... environments for learning ... locations within which meaning is constructed" ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]]), suggesting that different communities use different means of communication to accomplish their objectives.

To try to show the importance of the context in genre an example is used about a particular part of the genre theory—speech genres; but it is important to stress that context is really important in all situations. Context plays an important role in shaping genres (Holquist, 1986). Genre theory does not conceptualize context as simply the space outside of text or the container surrounding texts, but as dynamic environments that simultaneously structure and are structured by the communicative practices of social [[Structure and agency|agent]]s. Speech genres are recognizable patterns of language-in-context (Bakhtin, 1986): speech genres include both oral and written forms of language.

Researchers have also shown that the rhetorical moves people must make within accepted genres to communicate successfully in particular contexts operate to reinforce communities' identities and to legitimate particular communication practices. Thus, the genres that communities enact help structure their members' ways of creating, interpreting, and using knowledge (Myers; Winsor, Ordering, Writing; Bazerman, Shaping, Constructing; Berkenkotter and Huckin; Smart).
Genres are very important in our every day life and we do not realize how much we use them, how much they affect us, how much they determine the way we act and understand the others.

==Aspects of genre theory==

===Rhetorical situation===
[[File:James Matthew Barrie00.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. Barrie]]'s works were notoriously hard to place in any single genre.]]
In 1968, [[Lloyd Bitzer]] claimed that [[discourse]] is determined by rhetorical situations in his article titled, "The Rhetorical Situation". A rhetorical situation refers to the fact that every situation has the potential for a rhetorical response. He looks to understand the nature behind the context that determines discourse. Bitzer states, "it is the situation which calls discourse into existence".&lt;ref name=Bitzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd F.|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|date=Jan 1968|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2–4|doi=10.2307/40236733}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place. Each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either act upon or not act upon. He expresses the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse, because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation. Discourse varies depending upon the meaning-context that is created due to the situation, and because of this, it is "embedded in the situation".&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;

According to Bitzer, rhetorical situations come into existence, at which point, they can either mature and go away, or mature and continue to exist. Bitzer describes rhetorical situations as containing three components: exigence, [[audience]], and constraints. He highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are necessary to creating discourse. A situation calls a rhetor to create discourse, it invites a response to fit the situation, the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation, the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality, rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures, rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist. Bitzer's main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to "effect valuable changes in real" (Bitzer 14).

In 1984, Carolyn R. Miller examined genre in terms of rhetorical situations. She claimed that "situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of 'definition'".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn R.|title=Genre as Social Action|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=May 1984|volume=70|issue=2|pages=151–67|doi=10.1080/00335638409383686}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, we essentially define our situations. Miller seems to build from Bitzer's argument regarding what makes something rhetorical, which is the ability of change to occur. Opposite of Bitzer's predestined and limited view of the creation of genres, Miller believes genres are created through [[social constructs]]. She agreed with Bitzer that past responses can indicate what is an appropriate response to the current situation, but Miller holds that, rhetorically, genre should be "centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Since her view focuses on action, it cannot ignore that humans depend on the "context of the situation" as well as "motives" that drive them to this action.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Essentially, "we create recurrence," or similar responses, through our "construal" of types.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller defines "types" as "recognition of relevant similarities".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Types come about only after we have attempted to interpret the situation by way of social context, which causes us to stick to "tradition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Miller does not want to deem recurrence as a constraint, but rather she views it as insight into the "human condition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The way to bring about a new "type",&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines, thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change. Either way, Miller's view is in accordance with the fact that as humans, we are creatures of habit that tightly hold on to a certain "stock of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; However, change is considered innovation, and by creating new "types" we can still keep "tradition"&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; and innovation at the same time.

===Genre as social action===
The concept of genre is not limited to classifications and lists. People interact within genres daily. Genre is determined based "on the action it is used to accomplish" by the individuals using that particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; The distance between the text or action of genre and its users does not have to be vast. People respond to exigencies provided by genre every day. Exigence is "a set of particular social patterns and expectations that provides a socially objectified motive for addressing" the recurring situation of a particular genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Seeing genre as a social action provides the "keys to understanding how to participate in the actions of a [[community]]".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Carolyn R. Miller argues that, "a rhetorical sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse, but on the action it is used to accomplish".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

The idea that rhetorical situations define genre means that participants in genre make decisions based on commonalities and repeat those instances. Genre is not only about the form of but also the mere repetitiveness of similarities. The classroom setting exemplifies this. When students wish to speak, they raise their hands to signify that desire. Raising a hand is the correct response to speaking in turn in that particular social setting. A person at lunch with a group of friends would not raise their hand to speak because the social situation is different. Miller concludes that social actions are the response to "understanding how to participate in the actions of a community".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Carolyn R. Miller builds on arguments made by other scholars while also contradicting Bitzer's argument by giving her readers five features to understand genre.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  She believes that if something is rhetorical, then there will be action.  Not only will there be action, but this action will also be repeated.  The repetition of action creates a regularized form of discourse.  Miller would add that the result has more to do with the action accomplished by the situation.  Miller recognizes that a person chooses to take a certain social action within a defined set of rules - rules set in place by that user.  Lastly, a situation cannot dictate a response.  Miller ends her article with the thought that genres are partly rhetorical education through her statement, "as a recurrent, significant action, a genre embodies an aspect of cultural rationality".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;  Here, Miller unknowingly encapsulates a future ideology about genre: that genres are created by [[culture]].
According to Mnotho Dlamini genre is basically a deep information in a particular context.

===Social construct===&lt;!--romance and comedy are genres.--&gt;
Bitzer's definition of exigence as "an imperfection marked by urgency... something waiting to be done"&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt;  ties in with Miller's idea of social action as the next step after an exigency is realized. Miller also points towards the theory that genres recur, based on Jamieson's observation that antecedent genres finding their way into new genres. More importantly, Miller takes on the bigger picture of a rhetorical situation in which all of these steps happen. "Situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of definition".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; From this, it is understood that social constructs define situations and, therefore, exigence is also socially situated.

Genre, also, understood in terms of social contexts provides greater meaning to each recurring situation; it essentially allows for differentiation, though past genres have a role in present and new genres. Through this differentiation, genre is allowed to continue evolving, just as social contexts continue to change with time. Bawarshi describes the way in which this happens as "communicants and their social environments are constantly in the process of reproducing one another" (Bawarshi 69). Rhetoric essentially works the same way, as seen in the example of writing Bawarshi provides, "writing is not a social act simply because it takes place in some social context; it is social because it is at work in shaping the very context within which it functions".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"&gt;Bawarshi and Reif. ''Genre: An Introduction''. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, through social constructs, one can shape rhetorical works, and in turn, the works can shape the social context: "we create our contexts as we create our texts".&lt;ref name="Reif. p.70"/&gt;

===Antecedent genres===
Written in 1975, [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]]'s "Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint" declares that discourse is determined by the [[Rhetorical Situation]], as well as antecedent genres. Antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses. When placed in an unprecedented situation, a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response. However, caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints.&lt;ref name=Jamieson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jamieson|first=Kathleen Hall|title=Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=Dec 1975|volume=61|issue=4|page=414|doi=10.1080/00335637509383303}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands, and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created, the response to the situation might be inappropriate.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Through three examples of discourse, the papal [[encyclical]], the early [[State of the Union Address]], and congressional replies, she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each. These examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation. Jamieson explains, by use of these three examples, that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation. She discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become "bound by the [[manacles]] of the antecedent genre".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt; These "manacles," she says, may range in level of difficultly to escape. Jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present, because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre. She reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of "choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands".&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

===Reciprocity of genre===
People often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers. Amy Devitt states this when she says, "A genre is named because of its formal markers" (Devitt 10). However she also says, "the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named" (Devitt 10). When we label something as a certain genre, we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be.  These two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre. Devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list. A question posed by this example is, is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries? Though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another, they are both correct. Similarly, individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre. The rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre. In other words, genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another. Devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants' situation, contexts and text are all mutually created "no one aspect fully determines the other." (Devitt)

===Tyranny of genre===
The phrase "tyranny of genre" comes from genre theorist [[Richard Coe]], who wrote that "the 'tyranny of genre' is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity" (Coe 188). If genre functions as a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification system, it could constrain individual creativity, since "the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification; the presence of fewer features, or the presence of features of other genres, will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification" (Schauber 403).

Genres can act as constraints on readers as well.  Literary historian [[Hans Robert Jauss]] describes genres as creating a "[[horizon of expectation]]" under which readers will interpret texts based on how much they correspond to the features of the genre they recognize from works they have previously read.&lt;ref name=Jauss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jauss|first=Hans Robert|author2=Benzinger, Elizabeth|title=Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1970|volume=2|issue=1|page=13|doi=10.2307/468585}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification-system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres: "The status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity. Such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others" ([[Dominick LaCapra|LaCapra]] 220).

Under the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as "[[Genre#Genre as social action|social action]]" à la Miller,&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre's "tyranny of genre". Relying on the importance of the [[Genre#Rhetorical situation|rhetorical situation]] in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, "The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea [as social action] is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy" (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the [[Genre#Genre as social action|new genre idea]] insists that "human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres" (Killoran 72).

===Stabilization, homogenization and fixity===
Never is there total stabilization in a recognized genre, nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization. However, because of the relative similarities between the terms "stabilization" and "homogenization", the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion. Necessary discourse is, obviously, always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized. In rhetorical situation or antecedent genres, that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses. Outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse, one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate. The unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation.&lt;ref name=Jamieson /&gt;

Fixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. Fixity almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity, depending on the specific choice. If a situation calls for more mediated responses, the fixity of the situation is more prevalent, and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations. Stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand. The only option is affecting homogenization which in turn, can positively or negatively affect stability. Directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency. The same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes, creating either separate genres or modernized micro-genres. (Fairclough)

===Genre ecology and activity theory===
{{main article|Activity theory}}
Activity theory is not grounded in any one area of field of research, but instead draws from several disciplines including psychology, behaviorism, and socio-cultural studies. Although activity theory originated in the social sciences, it is currently applied most frequently to social-scientific, organizational, and writing studies. Modeled as a triangle, activity theory considers how multiple factors (subject, object, mediating artifacts, rules, and division of labor) existing in an activity system (environment) interact to achieve an outcome. Central to activity theory is the concept of mediation. Human activities are driven by a need to achieve a certain outcome or goal. Typically this activity is mediated by artifacts which include tools, language, signs, and cultural norms. In "Textual Objects" Cheryl Geisler explains that texts are traditionally identified as meditational means to complete a task, though she offers that texts might also be identified as the motive in discourse communities in which text is valued as the outcome as opposed to the means of an outcome. Geisler notes that texts produced for meditational means are typically more private/personalized, whereas texts identified as objects are often written with a public motive. She does not argue, however, that texts should exist exclusively as one or the other, but rather she suggests that texts can function as both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geisler|first=Cheryl|title=Textual Objects: Accounting for the Role of Texts in the Everyday Life of Complex Organizations|journal=Written Communication|year=2001|volume=18|issue=1|pages=296–325|doi=10.1177/0741088301018003003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some genre theorists, such as Clay Spinuzzi, genres are tools-in-use, and as such can be seen as mediating objects within the world. This view of genre as a tool-in-use is exemplified in the school of genre theory that studies genres' relationships to activity systems.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, C. J., Antunes, P., &amp; Dias, J. F. (2002). Integrating two organizational Systems through communication genres (pp. 125–132). Presented at the International Conference on Coordination Languages and Models, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Textual Grounding: How People Turn Texts into Tools," Jason Swarts asserts that users utilize texts as tools when they recognize the text's specific value in a rhetorical situation or environment. User's then "ground" texts, altering the texts structure for personal use, to make them usable under very specific conditions. The user takes the text from a "formalized representation of information" to a personal tool. Swarts argues that the meaning of a text is established by uptake of the users, though this varies depending on the user and the user's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swarts|first=Jason|title=Textual Grounding:How People Turn Texts Into Tools|journal=Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|year=2004|volume=34|issue=1|pages=67–89|doi=10.2190/eg0c-quey-f9fk-2v0d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design'', Clay Spinuzzi asserts that the use of certain tools in certain situations can help users to act purposefully in that activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|title=Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design|year=2003|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this tradition of genre studies, "Genres are not discrete artifacts, but traditions of producing, using, and interpreting artifacts, traditions that make their way into the artifact as a form-shaping ideology."&lt;ref&gt;Morson, G.S. and C. Emerson.''Mikhail Bakhtin:Creation of a Prosaics''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990. p.282-284.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of genres as mediating artifacts within activity systems is closely related to [[Activity Theory]], in which the interactions of different spheres of activity are examined. Activity theory, according to David Russell, "traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, David R. "Rethinking Genre in School and Society: An Activity Theory Analysis." ''Written Communication'' (October 1997). p.509.&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theorists examine the ways that the work done in one sphere of activity could potentially change the work done in another. For example, Russell examines how people use writing to mediate their activities, and how changes in one activity can lead to changes in another activity. Russell points out that "the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Russell. "Rethinking Genre." p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; Subtle changes in the use of writing in one activity can effect changes in the use of writing in related systems. If the government sets down new pharmaceutical documentation laws, then the teaching of how to document the distribution of pharmaceuticals will change, not just in pharmacies, but also in hospitals and nursing classrooms. Activity systems are always in flux, because subtle changes in one level of the system result in subtle changes in other levels of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Activity systems are still relatively stable, despite their constant flux. The changes within them are often subtle, and large scale changes usually occur over long periods of time.

'''Genre ecology''' describes the dense connections between genres within the activities that they mediate. Multiple genres mediate a single activity; no genre exists in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, Clay and M. Zachry. "Genre Ecologies: An open-system approach to understanding and constructing documentation." ''Journal of Computer Documentation'' 24.3 (2000). p:172.&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Ecology of Genre" Anis Bawarshi argues that genres are "rhetorical ecosystems" in which participants actively enact and, consequently, reenact social practices, relations, and identities. Participants use genre to interpret and perform social motives which sustain rhetorical ecosystems that produce social contexts, practices, and identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisser|first=Christian|title=Ecocomposition:Theoretical and Pedagogical Approaches|year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinuzzi, and other genre theorists studying the social aspects of genre (like Carolyn R. Miller, Amy Devitt, and Kathleen Jamieson, among others), genre is more than a category or artifact; genre is a way of interacting with the world. In the study of genre ecologies, genre is seen as a way people can accomplish activities.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Like activity systems, genre ecologies are not entirely stable, because activities change, causing the genres mediating them to change, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi. ''Tracing Genres''. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Take, for example the digitization of the workplace. Before computers, the workspace was largely mediated by genres such as the paper memo,or the company newsletter. After digitization, paper memos and paper newsletters began to disappear. Memos and newsletters did not disappear; instead, their distribution method changed. Now, memos and newsletters are disseminated electronically in emails. The genres of the memo and newsletter still exists, but they have changed, slightly, to reflect the changes in the activity system that they mediate.

===Secondary speech genres===
Mikhail Bakhtin's theorization of complex, secondary speech genres as composites of simple, primary speech genres in the analysis of the interaction between the multiple competing voices and registers in literary works. Bakhtin defines complex, secondary speech genres as "novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, major genres of commentary, and so forth [that] arise in more complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication" (62). While Bakhtin focuses on the historical emergence of the novel in much of his work, in his essay "The Problem of Speech Genres," he makes clear that his theory can be applied to all literary genres, including "profoundly individual lyrical work[s]" (61) such as the pastoral elegy. Complex, secondary speech genres are formed by "absorb[ing] and digest[ing] various primary (simple) genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communion" (62). Primary speech genres are "short rejoinders of daily dialogue," "everyday narration," "brief standard military command" (60), "verbal signals in industry" (63), "letters, diaries, minutes, and so forth" (98), notable for their referentiality to and function within the pragmatic communicative contexts of "extraverbal reality (situation)" (83). When primary speech genres are absorbed by secondary ones, they are "altered and assume a special character," losing "their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others" (62). This process of absorption and digestion of primary speech genres by secondary ones leads to a "more or less distinct dialogization of secondary genres, the weakening of their monological composition" (66). While Bakhtinian dialogization may weaken the monological composition of secondary speech genres, it does not preclude a dominant theme, ideology, or cultural meaning from arising out of interplay of the "various transformed primary genres" (98) that make up a secondary work (although, Bakhtin admits, this dominant ideology is difficult to isolate in complex works, and is, to a certain extent, left open to the interpretation of individual readers). Bakhtin explains that primary genres undergo a more or less thorough process of contestation and resolution within the secondary work they constitute and "enter into actual reality only via the [work] as a whole, that is, as a literary-artistic event and not as everyday life" (62). "As a rule, these secondary genres of complex cultural communication play out various forms of primary speech communication" (Bakhtin 98). Even as a work permits and enacts dialogization between characters, conventional forms, and semantic content, it resolves or "finalizes" that content into a "wholeness" of utterance, which is intelligible to readers, and therefore "guarantee[s] the possibility of response (or of responsive understanding)" (76). Through the finalization of disparate conventional and thematic strands, a work achieves the fullness of what Bakhtin calls its "specific authorial intent," Milton's "speech plan" or "speech will" for his work, and readies itself for responsive understanding (reception, interpretation) on the part of readers (77). Despite its internal dialogization, the work delivers itself to readers as a semantically exhaustive whole, and in this way uses its internal drama to respond ideologically to its genre: "other works connected with it in the overall processes of speech communication in [its] particular cultural sphere" (75). These include "works of predecessors on whom the author relies," "other works of the same school," and "works of opposing schools with which the author is contending" (75). In this way the work forms a crucial "link the chain of speech communion" of its genre (76).&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail M. "The Problem of Speech Genres." ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays''.

{{nihongo|'''''Gundam'''''|ガンダム|Gandamu|lead=1}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''Gundam series'''|ガンダムシリーズ|Gandamu Shirīzu}}, is a [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] that features [[giant robots]] ([[mecha]]) with the name "Gundam" (after the [[RX-78-2 Gundam|original titular mecha]]).  The franchise began on April 7, 1979 with ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', a [[TV series]] that defined the "[[real robot]]" [[mecha anime]] genre by featuring giant robots called [[powered exoskeleton|mobile suit]]s in a militaristic setting.  The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, [[Original Video Animation|OVA]]s, films, [[manga]], novels and video games, as well as a whole industry of [[model robot]]s known as [[Gunpla]] (plastic [[Gundam model]]).

Gunpla make up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081207100050/http://www3.jetro.go.jp/jetro-file/BodyUrlPdfDown.do?bodyurlpdf=05000892_001_BUP_0.pdf Flow of the Japan toy industry (日本の玩具産業の動向)], Japan Economics Department, Information section (日本経済情報課)&lt;/ref&gt; Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gundam-cartoon-academy-to-turn-science-fiction-into-reality-in-japan-zffmrwsvwgj|title=Gundam cartoon academy to turn science fiction into reality in Japan|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=November 1, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Concept===
''Mobile Suit Gundam'' was developed by animator [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] and a changing group of Sunrise creators with the collective pseudonym of [[Hajime Yatate]]. The series was originally entitled ''Freedom Fighter Gunboy'' (or ''Gunboy'') for the robot's gun, with boys the primary target demographic. Early production had a number of references to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]: the [[White Base]] was originally "Freedom's Fortress", the Core Fighter was the "Freedom Wing" and the Gunperry was the "Freedom Cruiser". The Yatate team combined the English word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to form the [[portmanteau]] ''Gundom''. Tomino changed it to ''Gundam'', suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies like a hydroelectric [[dam]] holding back water.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Archives, production notes&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the concept, Gundam are depicted as prototypes or limited-production, with higher capabilities than mass-produced units.

Most Gundam are large, bipedal, [[humanoid]] vehicles controlled from a [[cockpit]] by a human pilot. The cockpit is located in the [[torso]], while the [[head]] serves as a camera to transmit images back to the cockpit.

===Innovation===
''Mobile Suit Gundam'' reportedly pioneered the [[real robot]] subgenre of [[mecha anime]].&lt;ref name="Oppliger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2007/10/12/ask-john-which-gundam-series-have-had-the-most-impact-on-anime/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616111552/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2007/10/12/ask-john-which-gundam-series-have-had-the-most-impact-on-anime/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-06-16|title=Ask John: Which Gundam Series Have Had the Most Impact on Anime?|first=John|last=Oppliger|authorlink=AnimeNation#John Oppliger|date=2007-10-12|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=[[AnimeNation]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its [[super robot]] cousins, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' attempted realism in its robot design and weaponry by running out of energy and ammunition or malfunctioning. Its technology is derived from actual science (such as [[Lagrange points]] and the [[O'Neill cylinder]] in space) or feasible technology requiring only a few fictional elements to function (such as [[Minovsky Physics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Science, The High Frontier - G.K. O'neil's Space colonization plan, Gundam Century, Out Magazine special edition, Renewal Version&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Narrative}}Timelines===
Most of the ''Gundam'' animation (including the earliest series) is set in what is known as the Universal Century (UC) [[calendar era]], with later series set in alternate calendars or [[alternate future|timelines]]. Although many new Gundam stories are told in their parallel universe with independent timelines (giving them greater creative freedom), the original UC storyline continues to be popular. It established the series, setting the standard for [[hard science fiction]] in anime; the original ''Gundam'' marked the maturing of the giant-robot genre. Nostalgia for the oldest ''Gundam'' shows (and its status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is a factor in its continuing success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhi.co.jp/news/sec1/020220nl.html] ''機動戦士ガンダムは、同じくバンダイグループの（株）サンライズが制作し、1979年4月～1980年1月にテレビシリーズ第１作が放映されて以来、テレビシリーズ8作品、劇場用映画9作品などが公開され、20年以上にわたり人気を保っています。米国をはじめ、ヨーロッパ、アジアでも作品が放映され、各地で高い人気を得ています。''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoffs===
''[[SD Gundam]]'', a spinoff of ''Gundam'' which began during the mid-1980s, emphasizes comedy and adventure. ''[[Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G]]'' and ''[[Gundam Build Fighters]]'' feature contemporary settings and use Gunpla as plot elements.

=={{anchor|Franchise}}Media==

===TV series, films, and video===
Except for ''Mobile Suit Gundam 00'' (which follows the current [[calendar era]]), all mainstream Gundam series are set in a fictional era which begins after a drastic event or chain of events. The scenario commonly changes as the story progresses between Earth, space, space colonies and in some cases the Moon and [[Terraforming|terraformed]] planets.

===Manga and novels===
{{Main|List of Gundam manga and novels}}

Manga adaptations of the ''Gundam'' series have been published in English in North America by a number of companies, such as [[Viz Media]], [[Del Rey Manga]] and [[Tokyopop]], and in [[Singapore]] by [[Chuang Yi]].

===Video games===
{{Main|List of Gundam video games}}
''Gundam'' has spawned over 80 video games for arcade, computer and console platforms, some with characters not found in other ''Gundam'' media. Some of the games, in turn inspired spinoff novels and manga. Most ''Gundam'' video games, except ''[[Dynasty Warriors: Gundam]]'', were released only in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/altjapan-co-ltd/list-games/|title=MobyGames: Game Browser|website=MobyGames|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Gundam model}}Gundam models===
{{Main|Gundam model}}
Hundreds of Gundam models, primarily made of plastic but sometimes with resin and metal detail parts, have been released. They range in quality from children's toy kits to hobbyist and museum-grade models, and most are in 1:35, 1:48, 1:60, 1:100 or 1:144 scale. Promotional 1:6 or 1:12 scale models are supplied to retailers and are not commercially available. For ''Gundam''{{'s}} 30th anniversary, a full-size RX-78-2 Gundam model was constructed and displayed at Gundam Front Tokyo, in the Odaiba district;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appetiteforjapan.com/2015/12/02/gundam-odaiba/|title=Diver City Tokyo: the ultimate Gundam experience|last=appetiteforjapan|date=2015-12-02|website=Appetite For Japan|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was taken down on 5 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gundam.info/topic/17012|title=「実物大ガンダム立像」5年の歴史に幕。そして新たなプロジェクトへ！|work=公式ガンダム情報ポータルサイト「GUNDAM.INFO」|access-date=2017-04-12|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new statue of the Unicorn Gundam was erected at the same location, now renamed The Gundam Base Tokyo.

===Other merchandise===
[[Bandai]], ''Gundam''{{'s}} primary licensee, produces a variety of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.gundam.info/index/white|title=GUNDAM.INFO {{!}} The official Gundam news and video portal|website=na.gundam.info|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026105446/http://na.gundam.info/index/white|archive-date=2016-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies produce unofficial merchandise, such as toys, models and T-shirts. Products include Mobile Suit In Action (MSiA) action figures and Gundam model kits in several scales and design complexities. Each series generally has its own set of products, MSiA and model lines such as Master Grade and High Grade Universal Century may extend across series. The most popular action-figure line has been the Gundam Fix series, which includes the mecha in the animated series, manga and novels and accessories to create an updated version. In addition to Master Grade and High Grade Gundams, Bandai released a 30th-anniversary series of Gundam models in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki|first=Toshiyuki|title=RX-78-2 Gundam (RG) (Gundam Model Kits)|url=http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10115841|publisher=Hobby Search Co., Ltd.|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Grade (RG) Gundam series combined the Master Grade's detailed inner structure with additional colour separation, making the 1:144-scale series complex in design and compact in size. After the introduction of the RG Gundam series, Bandai released the Metal Build series in March 2011 (beginning with the 00 Gundam).&lt;ref name="Gundam metal build"&gt;{{cite web|title=METAL BUILD FREEDOM GUNDAM|url=http://www.gundamplanet.com/metal-build-freedom-gundam.html|publisher=Gundamplanet.com|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Bandai maintains several websites to promote ''Gundam'' projects; Gundam Perfect Web is the official Japanese site. Its English-language counterpart is the US-maintained Gundam Official. In 2005, the website hosted the Gundam Official User Forum. The forum was based on the existing fan forum, Gundam Watch, using many of its staff. When the project was retired, Gundam Watch was reborn and became Gundam Evolution.

A number of series-specific websites have been created, often available for a limited time (usually to promote a [[DVD]] release). Common content includes character and mecha listings, lists of related merchandise and pay-for-download content. Special pages are frequent, often presenting downloadable wallpaper or a small game. The ''[[Superior Defender Gundam Force]]'' website has a game in which players take the role of villain Commander Sazabi, attempting to blast his subordinate with weapons.

The '''Harlem Globetrotters''' are an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] [[basketball]] team. They combine [[wikt:athleticism|athleticism]], [[theater]], and [[comedy]] in their style of play. Over the years they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 123 countries and territories. The team's signature song is [[Brother Bones]]' whistled version of "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]". Their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named Globie. The team plays over 450 live events worldwide each year. The team is currently owned by [[Herschend Family Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Company buys Harlem Globetrotters |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9753269/harlem-globetrotters-acquired-herschend-family-entertainment-corp |website=www.espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive offices for the team are located in suburban Atlanta.

==History==
The Globetrotters originated on the south side of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the 1920s, where all the original players were raised. The Globetrotters began as the Savoy Big Five, one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom opened in January 1928, a basketball team of African-American players that played exhibitions before dances. In 1928, several players left the team in a dispute. That autumn, several of the players, led by Tommy Brookins, formed a team called the "Globe Trotters" and toured Southern Illinois that spring. [[Abe Saperstein]] became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. By 1929, Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the "New York Harlem Globe Trotters". Saperstein selected [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as their home city since Harlem was considered the center of African-American culture at the time and an out-of-town team name would give the team more of a mystique.&lt;ref name="harlem"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Jay | title = Harlem Globetrotters | website = [[WTTW]] |publisher=Window to the World Communications Inc.| url = http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=1,7,1,1,18 | accessdate = December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Globetrotters did not play in Harlem until 1968, four decades after the team's formation.

The Globetrotters were perennial participants in the [[World Professional Basketball Tournament]], winning it in 1940. In a heavily attended matchup a few years later, the [[1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game]], the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country, the Minneapolis Lakers (now the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]). Once one of the most famous teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the [[National Basketball Association]], particularly when NBA teams began fielding African-American players in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/books/review/24BERKOWL.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|title='Spinning the Globe': Ball Hog Heaven|first=Ira|last=Berkow|date=July 24, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Harlem Globetrotter [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate [[Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] became the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract when the [[New York Knicks]] purchased his contract from the Globetrotters.

The Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to [[Goose Tatum|Reece "Goose" Tatum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Harlem Globetrotters|url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/our-story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930215157/http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/our-story|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 30, 2011|title=Our Story|accessdate=May 23, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/03/21/harlem-globetrotters-keeping-fun-sports/bhSDDQwz3Jl0NCcKhR9dcM/story.html |work=The Boston Globe|publisher=[[John W. Henry|Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC]]|date=March 21, 2015|accessdate=May 23, 2015|title=Harlem Globetrotters keeping the fun in sports|first=Kevin Paul|last=Dupont}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globetrotters' acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful handling of one or more basketballs, such as passing or juggling balls between players, balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips, and making unusually difficult shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.axs.com/the-harlem-globetrotters-spin-their-way-to-denver-31752| agency= AXS| first= Deb| last= Flomberg|title=The Harlem Globetrotters spin their way to Denver|date=December 6, 2014| accessdate= May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Globetrotters invited [[Louis Klotz|Louis "Red" Klotz]] to create a team to accompany them on their tours. This team, the [[Washington Generals]] (who also played under various other names), became the Globetrotters' primary opponents. The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters, with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/washington-generals-folding-harlem-globetrotters/|title=Losers' Lament: After decades of defeat, the Washington Generals have lost for the final time|first=Joe|last=Posnanski|accessdate=August 14, 2015|work=[[NBC Sports]]|publisher=[[NBC Sports Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13433859/harlem-globetrotters-drop-washington-generals-primary-opponent|title=After 63 years, Globetrotters drop rival Generals as primary opponent|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015|first=Darren|last= Rovell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Harlem Globetrotters in Scheveningen.ogv|thumb|right|250px|The Harlem Globetrotters in the Netherlands (1958)]]
In 1959, the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Gricorevich, the director of [[Luzhniki Stadium|Lenin Central Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Sun 16 June 1959" /&gt; The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities; they met Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]&lt;ref name="Victoria Advocate 9 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Khruschchev Surprises U.S. Cagers By Street|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yQBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0IAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=5358%2C2447599|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|publisher=Victoria Advocate Publishing|date=July 9, 1959|agency=Associated Press|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.&lt;ref name="Cummings 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Harlem Globetrotters and Nikita Khrushchev|url=http://coldwarradios.blogspot.com/2011/01/harlem-globetrotters-and-nikita.html|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=Cold War Radios|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to one report, spectators were initially confused: "A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition."&lt;ref name="Eagle 7 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians Baffled by Harlem Fun|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sJAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-JcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=6190%2C2163140|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|publisher=Reading Eagle Company|date=July 7, 1959|agency=[[United Press International]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers.&lt;ref name="Sun 16 June 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe's 'Trotters Off to Moscow|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YY9lAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FooNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=3015%2C3683991|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|date=June 16, 1959|agency=Associated Press|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[Pravda]] stated, "This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks" but praised the Globetrotters' skills and suggested that "they have some techniques to show us."&lt;ref name="Leader-Post 8 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Globetrotters impress Soviets|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IatUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pzsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=3437%2C1213817|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Leader-Post]]|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=July 8, 1959|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American press—particularly [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]]—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent of $4,000, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off its criticism of race relations inside America, and that the USSR was becoming more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money).&lt;ref name="Pearson 1959"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Drew|title=US–USSR Relations Much Improved|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BJUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OUgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=7134%2C5499922|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Management Corporation]]|date=July 30, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 11 Sept 1959"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Drew|title=Ike Should Go to Russia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bVcrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8JwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=1202%2C1724043|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=September 11, 1959|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters. Greats such as "Wee" Willie Gardner, [[Connie Hawkins|Connie "The Hawk" Hawkins]], [[Wilt Chamberlain|Wilt "The Stilt" Chamberlain]], and [[Nathaniel Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] later went on to join the NBA. The Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold medalist [[Lynette Woodard]], in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cleveland.com/sports/index.ssf/2008/12/globetrotters_mains.html |work= [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]] |location= Cleveland |title= It's a new spin: Harlem Globetrotters trying to put a high-tech gleam on a vintage product |date= December 22, 2008 |first= Bill |last= Lubinger |accessdate= May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globetrotters have featured thirteen female players in their history. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Bob Gibson, and Ferguson Jenkins also played for the team at one time or another. 
Because the majority of the team players have historically been [[African American]], and as a result of the  buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters' [[sketch comedy|skit]]s, they drew some criticism during the [[Civil Rights]] era. The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of "Tomming for Abe", a reference to [[Uncle Tom]] and Jewish owner [[Abe Saperstein]]. However, prominent civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] (who would later be named an Honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating,
"I think they've been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;
In 1995, Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team. He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters' roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/sports/sports-people-basketball-a-non-black-player-joins-globetrotters.html|title=Sports People: Basketball – A Non-Black Player Joins Globetrotters|date=December 28, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|access-date=July 6, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned, the games themselves are not fixed. While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters’ hijinks while on defense, they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is "real". This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals, to the distress of a watching crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/basketball-3/as-the-harlem-globetrotters-ditch-their-archrivals-we-remember-the-one-time-the-washington-generals-won/|title=Washington Generals Beat Harlem Globetrotters|date=August 14, 2015|work=SportsGrid|access-date=July 6, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draft==
Starting in 2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual "draft" a few days before the [[National Basketball Association Draft|NBA draft]], in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: Anthony "Ant" Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William "Bull" Bullard (2008), Tay "Firefly" Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul "Tiny" Sturgess (2011), Jacob "Hops" Tucker (2011), Darnell "Spider" Wilks (2011), Bryan "B-Nice" Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), Corey "Thunder" Law (2013), Tyler "Iceman" Inman (2014) Devan "Beast" Douglas (2016) and AJ "Money" Merriweather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/harlem-globetrotters-mark-10th-anniversary-draft-first-ever-live-announcements-twitter|title=Harlem Globetrotters Mark 10th Anniversary of Draft with First-Ever Live Announcements on Twitter|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
The Harlem Globetrotters have been featured in several of their own films and television series:
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters (film)|The Harlem Globetrotters]]'', a 1951 feature film starring [[Marques Haynes]] and other Globetrotters, also featuring [[Thomas Gomez]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], Bill Walker, and Angela Clarke. Young Bill Townsend drops out of college to join the famous independent Trotter team. He also finds romance along the way. "Goose" Tatum and fancy dribbler Haynes were the star players of the Globetrotters at the time and Saperstein was the owner. Tatum, Haynes, Babe Pressley, Ermer Robinson, Duke Cumberland, Clarence Wilson, [[Pop Gates]], Frank Washington, Ted Strong, and other current team members appear in the film as themselves. Also featured is a lot of actual game footage (three times against the Celtics with [[Tony Lavelli]] and Big Bob Hahn), including the "Sweet Georgia Brown" warm-up routine. (Along with making the film, the team toured [[Major League Baseball]] stadiums that year and went on their first tour of South America.)
* ''[[Go, Man, Go!]]'', a 1954 sequel starring [[Dane Clark]] as Abe Saperstein and [[Sidney Poitier]] as Inman Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bosley |last= Crowther | authorlink = Bosley Crowther |title= The Screen in Review; Harlem Globetrotters Perform in a Sports Romance, 'Go, Man, Go!' at the Globe |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2DE1738E23BBC4852DFB566838F649EDE |work= The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 10, 1954 |accessdate=May 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 19, 1956, twelve members of the Globetrotters appeared as guest challengers on the TV panel show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' Clarence Wilson acted as the spokesman and was accompanied by members George "Meadowlark" Lemon, Charlie Hoxie, Roman Turmon, Andy Johnson, Woodrow "Woody" Sauldsberry, Carl Green, Leon Hillard, Willie Gardner, and others.
* ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', a [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Saturday morning cartoon]], broadcast from September 12, 1970, to May 1973. Originally broadcast on [[CBS]] and later rerun on [[NBC]] as ''The Go-Go Globetrotters''. The cartoon Globetrotters also guest-starred three times on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. [[Scatman Crothers]] provided the voice for [[Meadowlark Lemon]]'s character on the show.
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine]]'', a 1974 live-action Saturday morning [[variety show]] starring the Globetrotters that featured comedy skits, [[blackout gag]]s, and educational segments. The show was produced by Funhouse Productions and Yongestreet Productions for CBS. The show also starred [[Rodney Allen Rippy]] and [[Avery Schreiber]].
* ''[[The Super Globetrotters]]'', a second animated series created by Hanna-Barbera for [[NBC]] in 1979. It featured the Globetrotters (now including new squad members [[James Sanders (American basketball player)|James "Twiggy" Sanders]], [[Nate Branch]], and [[Louis Dunbar|Louis "Sweet Lou" Dunbar]]) as undercover [[superhero]]es who would transform themselves by entering magic portable lockers carried in "Sweet Lou" Dunbar's [[afro]] or in a basketball-shaped medallion. Although the Super Globetrotters would first attempt to take on the villain with standard comical heroics, things would almost always be settled with a basketball game.
* In a 1979 episode of ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'', the Globetrotters appear wherein Coach Reeves convinces the team to help him send his basketball team a reality check about overconfidence and underestimating their opponents as a result of a winning streak that got to his players' heads. The Globetrotters returned in season three (1980) when star player Warren Coolidge convinced that his basketball ability would preclude his need to finish high school, considers dropping out of school and trying out for the Globetrotters. After failing miserably in his tryout, Coolidge is persuaded to finish his education before giving any thought to a basketball career.
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'', a 1981 made-for-TV film featured the Globetrotters alongside [[Bob Denver]] and the rest of the cast of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. The film's plot follows the first animated series' formula to a degree with a conflict that ends with an unusual basketball game against an opposing team made up of [[robot]]s. The Globetrotters decide to play with standard moves in the first half, which the robots are able to counter until Gilligan unwittingly comments that they have not done any fancy tricks. This makes the Professor advise the team to use their comedic style of play to win, which hopelessly confuses the machines. However, a couple of Globetrotters suffer injuries, and the team needs the help of Gilligan and Skipper to substitute.
* In "Hoopla" (1984), an episode of the television series ''[[The Love Boat]]'', the Globetrotters are on a cruise and challenged the crew to a game in the dining room.
* In "[[Homie the Clown]]", an episode of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Krusty the Clown]] bets all the money he earned franchising his name against the Globetrotters in a game, saying that he "thought [[Washington Generals|the Generals]] were due". He then shouts "That game was fixed! They used a freakin' ladder for God's sake!"
* The animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' features several episodes in which the Harlem Globetrotters appear as brilliant scientists as well as basketball players living on another planet, the Globetrotter Homeworld. Ironically, the Harlem Globetrotters react harshly to anyone who "laughs at their antics" as evidenced in the episode "[[Time Keeps On Slippin']]" (2001).
* The Globetrotters appeared in the 2000 comedy ''[[Little Nicky]]'' with [[Adam Sandler]], wherein they are shown losing to the [[Washington Generals]], which is caused by one of Nicky's demonic brothers.
* ''Harlem Globetrotters: The Team that Changed the World'', a 2005 [[documentary film|documentary]] featuring interviews with the Globetrotters, NBA coaches, and fans such as [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Phil Jackson]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]—himself an honorary Globetrotter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Maurice |last= Sorrell |title=The Week's Best Photos | journal=JET |volume=51 |issue=17 |pages=41–41 |date=January 1977  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and including photos of the Globetrotters with [[Pope John Paul II]].
* ''[[Harlem Globetrotters: World Tour]]'', a video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and the [[Nintendo DS]]
* In ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'': [[The Amazing Race 15|season 15]] (2009), [[Herbert "Flight Time" Lang]] and [[Nathaniel "Big Easy" Lofton]] participated, finishing fourth place. They returned for [[The Amazing Race 18|season 18]] (2010), which is subtitled "Unfinished Business," featuring fan-favorite teams who lost the competition because of various circumstances. The pair finished second overall. They also returned for [[The Amazing Race 24|season 24]] (2014), dubbed an "All Star" season, featuring some of the shows fan favorites, this time finishing sixth.
* As part of the cross-promotion of ''The Amazing Race'', Lang and Lofton also appeared on [[CBS Daytime]]'s game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' to model prizes (a Sport Court basketball court) and present a showcase.
* In 2009 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title| id=1931370| title= 77th McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade ''(2010) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSx_Vsa9-tc |title=2010 2N Globetrotters | website= YouTube |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the Harlem Globetrotters appeared on the nationally-televised McDonald's Thanksgiving Day Parade in [[Chicago]].
* In 2010, five members of the Globetrotters appeared on ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'', raising money for charity.
* On December 5, 2010, in a game televised on [[ESPN2]] against the [[Washington Generals]] from [[HP Field House]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], the game saw several landmark events occur. A four-point shot may be scored from the four-point circle {{convert|35|ft|abbr=on}} away from the basket, with three minutes or less to go in any quarter. A penalty box was introduced as the price to be paid for any 'funny business' by a player. The Globetrotters made the first, and most, of the four-point shots in the game. All of the penalties in this game were assessed to the Globetrotters. The visiting Globetrotters went on to beat the Generals 104–98 in this historical game of firsts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/?article_id=276 |title= Game Ball From Historic 4-Point Shot Headed to the Hall| website= Harlem Globetrotters| access-date= December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three members of the Globetrotters appear in the "Harlem NY" episode (2011) of ''[[Man v. Food Nation]]'', in which they have to defeat a spicy two-pound barbecue sandwich in 15 minutes.
* Special K Daley, Ant Atkinson, and Blenda Rodriguez of the Globetrotters made a guest appearance in the October 18, 2011, episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', in which they talk with the Muppet [[Elmo]] about the number 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/trotters-appear-sesame-street |title= Trotters Appear on '&amp;#39;Sesame Street'&amp;#39; |website= HarlemGlobetrotters.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, the Globetrotters made a special guest appearance on [[Disney XD]]'s ''[[Kickin' It]]'', in the episode "Eddie Cries Uncle".
* Three members of the Globetrotters appeared in a February 28, 2012, episode of the [[Blendtec]] online video series ''[[Will It Blend?]]'', wherein they help Blendtec CEO Tom Dickson and his Uncle Floyd blend miniature basketballs, glitter dust, a whistle, and a bottle of [[Gatorade]]. The team then pour the mixture into a bucket, magically turning it into confetti, which they throw on Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Dickson, Tom (host) |date=February 28, 2012 |title=The Harlem Globetrotters |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalqszWGtEM&amp;hd=1 |medium=Television production |trans_title= |publisher=[[Blendtec]] |location= |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry J. Maar''' (1921–1992), known as "The Sultan of Balloons", was one of the pioneers in balloon twisting. He appeared for over a decade on episodes of the long running [[Bozo the Clown|Bozo's Circus]]. While the origins of balloon twisting is impossible to prove, [[Emmy Award]] winning producer/director Joseph Maar has provided evidence that his father, Henry, may be the founder of balloon twisting.&lt;ref name="Joe"&gt;Maar, Joseph.[http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html The Story of Henry Maar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075403/http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html |date=2007-09-30 }} TMyers.com 6/20/06 Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Moss (artist)|Larry Moss]] calls Joseph Maar's evidence "compelling" but warns that if Joseph Maar is correct then the history of balloon twisting would have to be rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Larry. [http://www.balloonhq.com/column/bhq/jul06/ Evolution of Balloon Entertaining] BalloonHQ. July 2006. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1975 book by "Jolly the Clown" Petri credits "Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939" as being the first balloontwister.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Ralph. [http://www.balloonhq.com/column/dewey/aug06/ Balloon History] BalloonHQ Column. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseph Maar's account==

Joseph Maar is the three time Emmy Award Winning Coordinating Director formerly with ESPN who worked on several shows including "Sports Center", "Sports Century", "Pardon the Interruption", "Around the Horn" and many other shows. He is also a client of some of the largest ballooning stores in the country.&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; His story of his father has been picked up by several sources as the story of the origins of Balloon Twisting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://balloon_animal.totallyexplained.com/ History: The Inventor and History of Balloon Twisting] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130205001800/http://balloon_animal.totallyexplained.com/ |date=2013-02-05 }} Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Maar, his father had pleurisy as a child and spent several years at a TB Sanitorium in Milwaukee. To develop his lungs, the facility had Henry blow up balloons. In the 1930s Henry became a [[vaudeville]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. While preparing for a show in 1938 or 1939, Joseph writes, "he came back to the car to get the rest of his magic tricks only to find the vehicle had been broken into and everything was gone."&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; With his magic tricks stolen, Maar went on stage and performed a show consisting primarily of balloon twisting. "Afterward, the agents went nuts and told him to forget the magic and to start doing the balloons. That &lt;nowiki&gt;[Henry Maar's agents said]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'everyone's doing regular magic tricks but no one is doing the balloon tricks.'"&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt;

Henry spent the next ten years performing under the stage name of "Johnny Ford" and entertaining GI's with the USO. After [[World War II]] an agent offered Maar twice his rate to wear a [[clown]] suit while performing his act. Joseph Maar states "that was the advent of a clown doing balloons."&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; From the late 50s to mid-70s, Joseph and a 1968 article from the Waukegan Sun-Times{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} cites that his father was a regular on "Bozo's Circus" and other children's shows. Two of these episodes reside with BalloonHQ and in IMDb he is listed in the credits of the March 16, 1977 episode of "Bozo's Circus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0805092/ Bozo's Circus] and [http://imdb.com/title/tt0254011/ Bozo's Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Maar also credits his father with inventing 'face painting.'  According to Joseph, his father would sometimes have trouble with his makeup during long summertime events. To cover his own need to touch up his clown make up, he would invite kids up on stage where Henry Maar would "make them up" like a clown.&lt;ref name="Joe" /&gt;

==Other origin stories==

While Joseph Maar's story has been accepted as "compelling," it is not viewed as conclusive. Other twisters have been credited with being the originator of balloon twisting. They include:

*Val Andrews, in ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'', credits H.J. Bonnert of Scranton, PA as being the "daddy of them all."&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;Andrew, Val. ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'' 1981, Magico Magazine, NYC quoted on [http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/history.html Balloon History] BalloonHQ. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Shirley, in the preface to ''One balloon animals; the rubber jungle / Roger's rubber jungle'' by Roger Siegel, writes "probably began sometime around 1920 but did not become popular until the advent of the skinny balloons after World War II...The inventor of the one balloon animal is unknown, but his origination opened the door to a new art." &lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;
*Jim Church III writes, " Frank Zacone from Youngstown, Ohio was doing a balloon act during the 1940s and had been doing the act for some time."&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13915">A '''magician's assistant''' is  a performer in a [[magic (illusion)|magic act]] who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the [[theatrical property|prop]]s that are used by a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.&lt;ref name="johnstone"&gt;{{cite journal

Although magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser [[Billing (film)|billing]] than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of [[Joanie Spina]], who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I did find fault with the term "assistant" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History and critiques==

[[File:FarlaAssistents.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sabrina and Vanessa with illusionist [[Christian Farla]]]]
Assistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded [[Timeline of magic|history of magic]] as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live [[vaudeville]] and [[variety shows]] and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womeninboxes"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.womeninboxes.com
 |title = ''Women in Boxes''
 |publisher = WIB, LLC
 |accessdate = 2007-04-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of "victim" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include ''[[Aztec Lady]]'', ''[[Devil's Torture Chamber]]'', ''[[Mismade Girl]]'', ''[[Radium Girl]]'', ''[[Zig Zag Girl]]'', and, perhaps most famous of all, ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]''.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in "Violent magic" the final episode of the six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series ''Magic'' in 2004, see {{cite web
 |url = http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0200-0249/0230.htm

 |accessdate = 2007-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a "sawing" type illusion was first performed publicly by [[P. T. Selbit]] in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled "''Sawing through a woman''" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House
 |year = 2003
 |pages = 277–295
 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.&lt;ref name="hiding2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:DietrichKlein.jpg|thumb|Magician Dorothy Dietrich sawing celebrity assistant and comedian Robert Klein in half on TV]] One female magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]] has turned the tables and used men as assistants, sawing them in half.  

Changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: "During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

That was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

In contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the [[Finsbury Park]] Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.&lt;ref name="hiding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artandartifice"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname "box jumper" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant.&lt;ref name="boxjumpers1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

[[Feminist]] critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is [[misogynist]]ic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see "[[#Documentaries|Documentaries]]" below).&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;

Some modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act [[Pendragons|The Pendragons]], for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional "box jumping" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is [[Kristen Johnson (escape artist)|Kristen Johnson]], who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an [[escapology|escape artist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12552">'''Minsky's Burlesque''' refers to the brand of [[American burlesque]] presented by four sons of Louis and Ethel Minsky: '''Abraham 'Abe' Bennett Minsky''' (1880–1949), '''Michael William 'Billy' Minsky''' (1887–1932), '''Herbert Kay Minsky''' (1891-1959), and [[Morton Minsky]] (1902–1987).&lt;ref name=morton&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morton Minsky Is Dead |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF123FF937A15750C0A961948260|quote=Morton Minsky, the last of four brothers who made burlesque a New York institution, died yesterday of cancer at his home in Manhattan.

Brother Abe, 54, had been running a nickelodeon theatre of his own and drifted in to help. When Brother Herbert, 40, acquired his law degree from Columbia and Brother Morton, 30, was graduated from New York University, they helped out, too.  |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=May 2, 1932 |accessdate=2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They started in 1912 and ended in 1937 in [[New York City]]. Although the shows were declared obscene and outlawed, they were rather tame by modern standards.

==History==
The eldest brother, Abe, launched the business in 1908 with a [[Lower East Side]] [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeon]] showing racy films. His own father shut him down and bought the National Winter Garden on Houston Street, which had a theater inconveniently located on the sixth floor. He gave the theater to Abe and his brothers Billy and Herbert. At first they tried showing respectable films but could not compete with the large theater chains. The Minskys tried to bolster their shows by bringing in vaudeville performers but could not afford good acts.

Then they considered [[American burlesque|burlesque]]. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called "wheels") supplied a new show every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the [[Columbia Wheel]], the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was "clean"; a fourth wheel, the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed to be the next [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].

But Minsky's clientele of poor immigrants had not been taught to appreciate clean burlesque, and the Minskys were not about to teach them. Plus, their audience needed a compelling reason to trek up to a sixth-floor theater. Billy realized that success in burlesque depended on how the women were featured. Abe, who had been to Paris and the [[Folies Bergère]] and [[Moulin Rouge]], suggested importing one of their trademarks: a runway to bring the women out into the audience. The theater was reconfigured, and the Minskys were the first to feature a runway in the United States. Billy had the sign out front changed to "Burlesque As You Like It – Not a Family Show," and the Minskys were on their way.

The Minskys were raided for the first time in 1917 when Mae Dix absent-mindedly began removing her costume before she reached the wings. When the crowd cheered, Dix returned to the stage to continue removing her clothing to wild applause. Billy ordered the "accident" repeated every night. This began an endless cycle: to keep their license, the Minskys had to keep their shows clean, but to keep drawing customers they had to be risqué. Whenever they went too far, they were raided.

Morton joined the company in 1924, after graduating from [[New York University]], and worked at the Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. There was a raid during the very first show. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after [[payola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=4 Brothers |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7DB153FF933A05750C0A960948260|first=Gerald |last=Goldberg|work=[[New York Times]]|quote=Morton - the youngest of the four Minsky brothers - joined the family firm in 1924, fresh out of New York University, and became the resident Minsky at their newly acquired Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after payola. |date=March 30, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy's attempt, however, to present classy burlesque at the Park Theater on Columbus Circle failed miserably.

Another famous raid occurred in April, 1925, and inspired the book and film ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. By this time it was permissible for women in shows staged by Ziegfeld, [[George White's Scandals|George White]], and [[Earl Carroll]] – as well as burlesque – to appear topless as long as they did not move (a similar rule in London burlesque was famously demonstrated in the film [[Mrs. Henderson Presents]]). In a show at the National Winter Garden, Mademoiselle Fifi (née Mary Dawson from Pennsylvania) stripped to the waist and then moved.  Occasionally a raid was triggered by the comedy material, but filthy comics did not last long, because they were a liability to the management.

Business boomed during [[Prohibition]] and the National Winter Garden's notoriety grew. Regular patrons included [[John Dos Passos]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[George Jean Nathan]], [[Condé Montrose Nast|Condé Nast]], and [[Hart Crane]] (see Crane's poem "National Winter Garden" in [[The Bridge (long poem)|''The Bridge)'']].

Billy realized that while burlesque could not be classy it could be presented in classy surroundings. In 1931 he proposed bringing the Minsky brand to Broadway, amid the respectable shows. The brothers leased the Republic Theater on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and staged their first show on February 12. The Republic became Minsky's flagship theater and the capital of burlesque in the United States. (The theater is now called the [[New Victory Theater|New Victory]] and, ironically, specializes in children's entertainment.) Other burlesque shows were inspired to open on 42nd Street at the nearby Eltinge and Apollo Theaters.

[[The Great Depression]] ushered in the greatest era for burlesque, and Minsky burlesque in particular. Few could afford to attend expensive Broadway shows, yet people craved entertainment. Furthermore, there now seemed to be an unlimited supply of unemployed pretty women who considered the steady work offered by burlesque. By the time they finished expanding, the various Minskys controlled over a dozen theaters – six in New York and others in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Albany, and Pittsburgh. They even formed their own "wheel."

Minsky's featured comics [[Phil Silvers]], [[Joey Faye]],&lt;ref&gt;He was "House Comic" from 1931 to 1939,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rags Ragland]], [[Zero Mostel]], [[Jules Munshin]], [[Jimmy Savo]], [[Eddie Collins]], [[Pinky Lee]], [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[Red Buttons]], [[Benny Rubin]], [[Irving Benson]], [[Red Skelton]], and [[Abbott and Costello]], as well as headlining [[stripper]] [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; Others included [[Danny Kaye]], [[Jack Albertson]] and [[Robert Alda]], as well as [[stripper]]s [[Lili St. Cyr]], [[Georgia Sothern]], [[Ann Corio]], [[Margie Hart]], [[Mara Gaye]] and [[Sherry Britton]]. These women, who began stripping in their teens, made between $700 and $2,000 a week.

With burlesque thriving in New York (there were now 14 burlesque theaters, including Minsky's rivals), competition was fierce. Each year, various license commissioners issued restrictions to keep burlesque from pushing the limits. But convictions were rare, so theater managers saw no need to tone down their shows.The Minskys emphasized that a good strip-tease dance must know exactly the right psychological moment to remove each garment. 'It is not just a matter of going on the stage and taking off clothes - it needs finesse.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Zemeckis, Leslie (2013). [www.behindtheburlyq.com Behind The Burly Q] Check |url= scheme (help). Delaware: Skyhorse. {{ISBN|978-1-62087-691-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, irate citizens' groups began calling for action against burlesque. [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]] deemed them a "corrupting moral influence." &lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The city's license commissioner, Paul Moss, tried to revoke Minsky's license but the State Court of Appeals ruled that he did not have grounds without a criminal conviction. Finally, in April, 1937, a stripper at Abe Minsky's New Gotham Theater in Harlem was spotted working without a [[G-string]]. The ensuing raid led to the demise not only of Minsky burlesque but of all burlesque in New York. The conviction allowed Moss to revoke Abe's license and refuse to renew all of the other burlesque licenses in New York.

After several appeals, the Minskys and their rivals were allowed to reopen only if they adhered to new rules that forbade strippers. The owners went along, hoping to stay in business until the November election when reformist mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] might be voted out. But business under the new code was so bad that many New York burlesque theaters closed their doors for good. By the time La Guardia was re-elected, the word "burlesque" had been banned and, soon after, the Minsky name itself, since the two were synonymous. With that final blow, burlesque and the Minskys were finished in New York.

=== Harold Minsky ===
Of all the Minskys, only '''Harold,''' Abe's adopted&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;Goodwin, Joanne. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003956/http://onlinenevada.org/Minsky_s_Burlesque "Minsky's Burlesque,"] Online Nevada Encyclopedia. Accessed Aug. 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; son, remained active in burlesque. Harold started at age nineteen at the height of the [[Great Depression]], learning the business by working in all facets from the [[box office]] to theater management. "At nineteen, Harold took over the business from his father. Every summer, his parents went to Europe for vacation and the theatres would close due to the heat in [[New York City]]. Theatres
weren’t air-conditioned. The performers begged Harold to keep his doors open; the girls were broke, and they desperately needed the money from the performances. So Harold stayed open and, though a ticket cost a dime, 'He made over
a million dollars,' claimed his wife Dardy Minsky.” &lt;ref name=Zemeckis&gt;{{cite book|last=Zemeckis|first=Leslie|title=Behind the Burly Q|date=2013|publisher=Skyhorse|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-62087-691-6|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By his early twenties, Harold had already produced shows. Harold was the first one to do nudity in a nice way.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Harold would become responsible for discovering and grooming dozens of the most famous names throughout the 1930s into the '50s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Harold claimed to have targeted future headliner fourteen-year-old [[Sherry Britton]] from an audition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Harold also employed and nurtured first-rate comic talents such as [[Phil Silvers]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt; Zemeckis, Leslie (2013). [www.behindtheburlyq.com Behind The Burly Q] Check |url= scheme (help). Delaware: Skyhorse. {{ISBN|978-1-62087-691-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Harold brought the Minsky name to a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] revue at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]],&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; where it could exist without apology. Harold, Dardy and their two children moved there while he put on a show at the Dunes.  He kept a [[chorus line]], top-rate comedians, a snazzy band, and, of course, the star strippers.  He did smashing business; for the first time making burlesque accessible to an upper-middle-class crowd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; That [[revue]] ran for six years; subsequently, he moved Minsky productions into other landmark casinos such as the [[Silver Slipper]], the Thunderbird, and [[The Aladdin]]. 

Harold resided in Las Vegas until his death in 1977.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt;

A '''motive''', in law, especially [[criminal law]], is the cause that moves people to induce a certain action.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book 
|title= Blacks Law Dictionary, Abridged Eight Edition

|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motive, in itself, is not an [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of any given [[crime]]; however, the legal system typically allows motive to be proven in order to make plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those motives may be obscure or hard to identify with. However, a motive is not required to reach a verdict.&lt;ref name="JRank Articles 2014"&gt;Law Library - American Law and Legal Information - JRank Articles. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Motives are also used in other aspects of a specific case, for instance, when police are initially investigating.&lt;ref name="JRank Articles 2014"/&gt;

The law technically distinguishes between motive and [[intent (law)|intent]].  "Intent" in criminal law is synonymous with ''[[Mens rea]]'', which means the mental state shows liability which is enforced by law as an element of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mens Rea |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea |website=LII / Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2015-10-15 |first=Sara S. |last=Frug}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Motive" describes instead the reasons in the accused's background and station in life that are supposed to have induced the crime. Motives are often broken down into three categories; biological, social and personal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologydiscussion.net/motive/types-of-motives-biological-social-and-personal-motives-psychology/694 Types of Motives: Biological, Social and Personal Motives]. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
There are two objections to motive when considering punishment. The first is volitional objection, which is the argument that the person cannot manage his or her own motives and therefore cannot be punished for them. The second objection is neutrality objection. This is based on the idea that our society has contrasting political opinions and therefore a government’s preference should be limited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.law.upenn.edu/phr/conversations/status/viewFile.cfm?file=Hessick2_467_1.pdf.|title = Motive's Role in Criminal Punishment|last = Hessick|first = Carrisa|date = 2006|journal = Southern California Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pertinence ==
There are four different ways a defendants motive can be pertinent to his or her criminal liability. Motive can be fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this is when motive is fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible then that motive is fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the motive is partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant is responsible, the motive is partially inculpatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">The  term '''multilingual titling''' defines, in the field of [[titling]] for the performing arts (musical theatre, drama, audiovisual productions), the chance for the audience to follow more than one linguistic option.

==History==
In the audiovisual field, multilingual titling was made possible by the introduction of [[DVD]] (1996) &lt;ref name="DVD first appearance (1996)"&gt;DVD was first launched on the market by [[Warner Home Video]] both in the USA (1996) and in Europe (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an integrated data-base gives access to several language channels dedicated to titling.&lt;br /&gt;
In the live performing arts, multilingual options (with possibility of individual choice) were introduced in 1998 at [[Santa Fe Opera]] by mean of custom individual displays set mainly on the back of the seats, as in airplanes.&lt;ref name=" set mainly on the back of the seats, as in the airplanes "&gt;This device, lately adopted by other international theatres, has been realized by [[Figaro Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction, at the end of the 1900s, of Web 2.0 and of the new mobile device technologies caused deep changes also in this field. &lt;br /&gt;
In Europe, in 2011, a significant innovation was provided by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] Theatre in Florence, which started the testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices,&lt;ref name="testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices "&gt;OperaVoice devised the software.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be integrated to monolingual [[surtitles]].&lt;br /&gt;
In the same year, another multilingual software for mobile consumer devices was developed, as an alternative to the use of [[subtitles]] in cinemas and, the following year (2012), a new head-mounted display system (multimedia glasses) was introduced, serving the same function.&lt;ref name="starts off a new head mounted display system (multimedia glasses) which serves the same function"&gt;Both products (app and glasses) are by MovieReading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011-2012, the Royal Opera House Muscat carried out the most advanced multilingual custom display system to date, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel.&lt;ref name="multilingual custom display system nowadays, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel"&gt;A [[Radio Marconi]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solutions==
The simultaneous presentation of two languages is quite unusual within the more traditional surtitling system, which is used in most cases with monolingual function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9654">The '''National Society of Arts and Letters''', known as the NSAL, is an American non-profit group founded in 1944 as a [[women's organization]] to assist promising young artists through arts [[competitions]], [[scholarships]] and other [[career]] opportunities.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history"&gt;NSAL, [http://www.arts-nsal.org/history.shtml "The History of NSAL"] (NSAL website, last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara McCormick, [http://www.bocaratontribune.com/national-society-of-arts-and-letters-hosts-afternoon-tea/ "National Society of Arts and Letters Hosts Afternoon Tea"], ''Boca Raton Tribune'', March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation"&gt;[http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=2719 "National Society of Arts and Letters Day"] (May 13, 2008) - Proclamation by City of Bloomington, Indiana, dated May 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition.

==National Career Awards Competition==
The National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, [[dance]], [[drama]], [[literature]], [[music]] or [[musical theater]]. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First-place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society’s annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more.

The competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts.

During its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer [[Shirley MacLaine]] and international opera star [[Jessye Norman]] among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization.

All competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A [[master class]] is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one-on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged.

==History==
Begun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.uiuc.edu/events/national-society-of-arts-and-letters "National Society of Arts and Letters"], "Events" (Announcements), University of Illinois Dept. of Dance (last visited July 15, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non-political and non-profit-making. The [[Chevy Chase]], [[Maryland]] Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder.

A second chapter, the [[Chicago]] Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago).

On June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: [[Washington, D.C.]], Chicago, [[Florida]], [[Colorado]], [[North Dakota]], [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Kentucky]]. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter.

By 1946 four more chapters had started: [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]] and [[New Jersey]]. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15–16 of that year, at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. [[First Lady of the United States|American First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]], initiated the festivities with a reception at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;

As growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A [[Certificate of Incorporation]], was issued July 29, 1949 and [[tax-exempt status]], was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started.

In October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central [[Illinois]] Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders.

Today there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states.

==Master classes==
Part of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges.

The National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership.

Master classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including:
* Larry Leichman (co-owner of [[Arbor Books]]), literature
* Joel Revzen, [[Nathan Gunn]] and Gayletha Nichols, singing
* Robert and Louise McCall, art
* Brian Palmer, assistant professor of dance and Chair of the Division of Theatre and Dance at [[Jacksonville University]], dance
* [[Terence Knapp]], acting and theater
* Mark Hoebee, Associate Director of [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], theater
* [[George Pinney]] co-creator of Blast!
* Jane Alderman
* Karen Azenberg, [[choreographer]], dance
* Marek Cholewa, dance
* [[Lucine Amara]] of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], music
* Sarah Caldwell [[Dramatic Soprano]], Maestra, opera
* Alfonso Montecino, concert pianist, music
* Lori Belilove, [[modern dance]]
* Cynthia Bringle, pottery
* Professor [[Josip Novakovich]], writing.

==Awards==
Since the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition.

Early on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition.

Individuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include:

NSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award

A second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient’s field.

Notable recipients of NSAL awards have included [[Malcolm Frager]] (pianist),&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation" /&gt; [[Shirley MacLaine]] (actor),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Jessye Norman]] (opera singer; winner of a NSAL contest),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Menahem Pressler]] (Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters),&lt;ref&gt;[http://menahempressler.org/?page_id=381 MenahemPressler.org], last visited 2012/07/16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Balanchine]] (1980 Gold Medal of Merit recipient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sab.org/school/history/balanchine_biography.php Balanchine Biography], School of American Ballet at Lincoln Center] (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">'''Neo-[[Benshi]]''' is the practice of producing live alternate voice-overs for movies.

The art form’s acknowledged starting point is in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other East Asian nations during the silent film era. [[Benshi]] is a Japanese word referring to the oral "interpreter" who performed a live narrative accompaniment to silent movies, in lieu of showing intertitles with dialogue, etc. In Korean the practice is known as pyônsa. Currently, it is finding a resurgence among experimental poets in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles.

==Movietelling==
Movietelling is a reinstatement, or retelling, of the film narrator practice(s). Long time practitioner and one of the foremost scholars on the subject of live film narration, Walter Lew, coined this phrase with the intention of reviving and revamping what he considers to have been an international practice, finding its roots throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. In January 2008, Walter Lew, along with several poets and video artists, began shadoWord productions, an organization dedicated to the practice, as well as the evolution, of Movietelling.

'''''Nickelodeon Guts''''' (stylized as '''''Nickelodeon GUTS''''') is an American television "action sports" competition series hosted by actor/writer [[Mike O'Malley]] and [[Referee|officiated]] by British actress [[Moira Quirk|Moira "Mo" Quirk]]. The series originally ran from 1992 to 1996 on [[Nickelodeon]].

Each episode features three young athletes competing against each other in four "extreme" versions of athletic events culminating in a fifth and final round which set the three competitors on a race up an artificial "mountain" called the '''Aggro Crag''', '''Mega Crag''', or '''Super Aggro Crag'''. ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' reruns were shown on [[Nickelodeon]] from January 15, 1996 until January 31, 1999 before moving to [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nickelodeon GAS]] from March 1, 1999 until the station ceased broadcasting on December 31, 2007 (April 23, 2009 on [[Dish Network]]). It has occasionally been seen in reruns on [[TeenNick]] since January 1, 2008; since 2011 those reruns would be found on the channel's ''[[NickSplat]]'' block on an occasional basis.

Season 1 began taping on August 12, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burton|first1=Tim|title=New show for kids|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7492802/nickelodeon_guts_1992/|accessdate=December 29, 2016|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=August 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Nickelodeon produced two seasons of a revival of the program, ''[[My Family's Got GUTS]]''.

==Setting==
The series was filmed at [[Impact Wrestling Zone|Sound Stage 21]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]] on a set dubbed the "Extreme Arena". This arena consists of a turf playing field, a pool, an obstacle course, and the Aggro Crag.

==Gameplay==
On each half-hour episode, three children or teenagers (blue, red and purple) compete against each other in four events that are based on "extreme" versions of skills in popular sports, such as basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. While most of these events include the use of an elastic harness, others make use of a [[wave pool]], and sometimes a racing track is used. During the show's run, more creative and ambitious events were developed, even including a fabricated ski slope.

The competitors are awarded points based on their comparative performance in each event. First place in each event is worth 300 points. Second place receives 200 points, and third place earns 100 points.

The contestants are introduced in the breaks between events in a segment dubbed "Spill Your GUTS". The segment was done as an interview with one of the hosts in the first two seasons (O'Malley in season 1 and Quirk in season 2), and was subsequently a pre-recorded segment. In seasons 3 and 4, the contestants introduced themselves. In season 5, during Global Guts, a flag of the player's country would be shown, followed by the contestant introducing him/herself. Then, the location where the contestant is from would be shown on a map, followed by him/her giving more information about what he/she does.

==Events==
There are several different types of events, ranging from field sports to the pool. Many aerial events made use of elastic harnesses.

==The Crag==
The fifth and final event of each episode pits the three contestants in a race to climb a fabricated mountain called the Aggro Crag (season 1–2), and later called the Mega Crag (season 3), and the Super Aggro Crag (Global GUTS). Each contestant had a separate (but identical) side of the mountain to climb, and was not permitted to cross into their opponents' paths or disrupt their progress.

The object of the Crag was for all three contestants to race to the peak of the Crag, while hitting a series of buttons (referred to as "actuators") along the way to the peak. If a contestant misses any of the actuators along the way, a spotter at the top (often referred to as the "crag troll") prevents that player from completing the climb until he/she returns and activates whatever targets they missed. The first contestant to successfully activate all of their actuators, including the final one at the peak, earns 725 points. The second and third-place contestants earn 550 and 375 points, respectively.

The climb is made more difficult by strobe lights "lightning", foam rock "avalanches", flying "snow" in the form of glitter and confetti, and "nuclear flying crystals" that are each triggered either at random or when the players step on specific switchbacks on the crag.

A number of violations/errors on the Crag could result in a player automatically receiving third place points. These include:
* Crossing into another player's section of the mountain
* Hitting someone else's actuator (excluding the final actuator)
* Reaching the top of the mountain by grabbing a hand rail, a rule seldom enforced during the Mega Crag
* Making a false start at the beginning of the climb
* Finishing the climb without lighting all of one's own actuators
* Not stepping on all of the boulders in the Crag's "Boulder Canyon" section, introduced in the 1993 season, at the base of the mountain.

The increased point structure in the final event allows contestants overcome a deficit of as much as 300 points to win,&lt;ref&gt;The first four events are scored in increments of 100. The winner of the Crag can earn as many as 350 points more than the contestant who finishes the Crag third.&lt;/ref&gt; despite earlier mistakes. The point structure for the Crag eliminates the possibility of a tie except in the unlikely event that two players who are already tied are each disqualified during the Crag and therefore both receive third-place points. While dual-disqualifications did occur during the show's run, it never resulted in a tie.

The sound design for the action on the Aggro Crag was created by Nickelodeon Senior Sound Designer Mark Schultz, who converted the voltages supplied by the infrared actuator "eyes" to triggers read by a MIDI-based sampler.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=XxylMGZIPEEC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;dq=Mark+Schultz+Nickelodeon+Guts+MIDI&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=caW3DfhuC4&amp;sig=5IFUkwo8LMpV3wGSSeDlzOrQRvY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1v6Stt5LZAhUCKGMKHamEB0UQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Mark%20Schultz%20Nickelodeon%20Guts%20MIDI&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The total height of the Aggro Crag was {{convert|28|ft|m}}. For the Mega Crag, as well as the Super Aggro Crag on ''Global GUTS'', the total height was {{convert|30|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;Nickelodeon.

==Winning==
The player with the most points after all five events wins the game and receives a gold ''GUTS'' medal, as well as a faux glowing piece of the Aggro Crag. When the show changed to ''Global GUTS'', the medals were redesigned to reflect the show's new logo. With all seasons of the show, second place receives a silver medal and third receives a bronze medal. The highest possible score for a player is 1,925 points, and was attained several times throughout the show's run. Three contestants who achieved this score in 1992 were invited back to compete in a one-hour ''GUTS All-Star Special'' in 1993.

==''Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars''==
On July 25, 1993, at the start of the show's second season, Nickelodeon aired a one-hour special known as ''Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars'', where three former players from the previous season who made a perfect score of 1,925 points compete for a college scholarship and a special GUTS All-Star trophy. The one-hour special featured seven events plus the Aggro Crag. This special also debuted five new events, which were later seen throughout the second season. The new events were: Rebound, Tornado Run, Hang Ten, Fumble and Mad Max. The special also included an extended version of Basic Training. The three perfect-scoring players from the first season were: Mike "Superman" Schmidt, Jana "The Warrior" Waring, and Kelli "The Maniac" Marchewka. In the award ceremony, each player received a silver Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars plate along with their college scholarship. Third place received a $1,000 college scholarship, second place received a $1,500 college scholarship and the winner received a $2,500 college scholarship. Jana "The Warrior" Waring, dressed in red, won the Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars trophy at the end of the show. In 1994, Sony Wonder released a VHS based on the "All-Star Special", which featured special guest commentaries by Super Bowl Champion Lawrence Taylor.

==''Global GUTS''==
For the show's final season, Nickelodeon produced an international spinoff, '''''Global Guts''''', featuring contestants from various countries, including the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Mexico]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (simply referred to as "CIS" on air, this included only [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]). Although the countries had multiple contestants, no country was ever represented twice in a single episode except for the Special Olympic special where it had 2 U.S. players. Each country had its own team of broadcasters; O'Malley retained this role for the US broadcast. The format remained identical to the original version, but the Mega Crag was upgraded to the ''Super Aggro Crag''. In the "Spill Your GUTS" segments, for players from non-[[English language|English]]-speaking countries, an interpreter was used.

Taping of ''Global GUTS'' took place from July 12 to August 15, 1995, and episodes began airing September 5, 1995,&lt;ref name="hinman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinman|first=Catherine|title=Nickelodeon's 'GUTS' Wins over the World|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=1995-08-29|quote=[''Global GUTS''] debuts Sept. 5 in the United States on Nickelodeon ... the show ... began production July 12 and wrapped up Aug. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of [[Nick in the Afternoon]].

Medal presentations were also accompanied by the raising of flags and the playing of the national anthem of the winning country, and a victory lap by the contestants, draped in the flags of their home countries.&lt;!---It wasn't just the winner who took a victory lap.---&gt; A medal count was also tabulated at the beginning of each episode, similar to the [[Olympics]].

In addition to airing the program on Nickelodeon in the United States, these broadcasters have seen in represented countries as follows:
*Germany: [[Nickelodeon (Germany)|Nickelodeon]]
*Israel: Israeli's Children Channel
*Mexico: [[MVS Multivisión]]

==Famous contestants==
In 1992, [[Backstreet Boys|Backstreet Boy]] [[A. J. McLean|A.J. McLean]] appeared on ''Nickelodeon GUTS'', competing against Amanda "The Accelerator" Bulger and Jamie "The Jackal" Mendelsohn, and finished with the silver medal. He was in blue and referred to on the show as AJ "Mean" McLean. He had one event win during his appearance, that being a win in the Slam Dunk event.

In 1993, Hollywood stuntwoman [[Anna Mercedes Morris]] competed on the show under the name Anna "Roadrunner" Morris. She was dressed in red, competing against "Lawless" Lauren Shealy and Paul "Running Man" Battson, and she finished with the gold medal, despite injuring her knee in the Basic Training event.

In 1993, actor [[Mike Vogel]] competed on ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' with Christy "Blast" Gast and Cam "The Ice Man" Burke, and finished with the silver medal. He tied with the other players for first place on Over the Top and also won the Aggro Crag event, coming from third place to take second overall. He was known as Mike "Flea" Vogel and was dressed in blue.

In 1994, actress [[Ashley Eckstein|Ashley Drane]] competed on ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' with Nicole "The Bomber" Bozard and UK resident Leanne "Panther" Kelley, and finished with the silver medal. She was known as Ashley "The Face" Drane and was dressed in blue. Exactly 10 years later, Ashley made a 2nd Nickelodeon appearance, this time on ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]'' playing Drake's girlfriend Susan in the episode "Believe Me Brother". Mike "The Dominator" Drane, a ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' player from season 1, is also her brother.

In 1994, [[D. C. United]] defender [[Bobby Boswell]] appeared on ''Nickelodeon GUTS'', competing against Robin "The Lizard" Rexroat and Jennifer "The Jaguar" Barnes, and finished with the silver medal. He was known on the show as Bobby "Lightning" Boswell and won the soccer event "Shoot Out", just a hint of what was to come for his career. Boswell, who was dressed in purple, also won the Mega Crag event in that very same show.

==Special guests==
The only guest during the 1992 season:
* [[Wendy Bruce]]

The only guest during the 1993 season:
* [[Lawrence Taylor]]

The following were guests during the 1994 season:
&lt;!--- In order of appearance in the first five episodes of the season ---&gt;
* [[Evander Holyfield]]
* [[Charlie Ward]]
* [[Adam Oates]]
* [[Picabo Street]]
* [[Dominique Wilkins]]

The guests in the 1994 season would, before each event, give a list of three "Smart Moves" (suggestions) that they felt that the players should follow.

The only guest during the 1995 season (Global GUTS):

*[[E.T.|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]] (only during the Medal Ceremony)

==Episode status==
All of the episodes of ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' exist, and have aired on [[Nickelodeon]] until 1999, the now defunct [[Nick GaS]] from 1999 to 2007. ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' was also on the list of programs to be included on ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' ([[TeenNick]]'s 1990s block) upon its launch in July 2011, but the program did not make its debut until August 2013.

As of October 2015, the show airs in reruns occasionally on the TeenNick block ''[[The Splat]].''

==2008 revival==
{{main|My Family's Got Guts}}

A revival of the show, ''My Family's Got Guts'', debuted on September 15, 2008, filmed at Universal Studios Florida as was the original (but due to it already being occupied, not on the same sound stage as the original). This version is hosted by [[Ben Lyons]], along with Australian celebrity Asha Kuerten as the referee. Unlike the original, it follows a bracket tournament format featuring 2 families competing as teams per episode, with points earned being used instead to provide a head start during the Aggro Crag rather than deciding the winner.

==Video game==
In November 1994 Nickelodeon released a video game based on the ''Nickelodeon GUTS'' game show for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. One or two players may compete in many of the events that debuted in the TV show, including the Aggro Crag. The game is based on the actual footage of the show and contains filmed contestants.&lt;ref&gt;Bassave, Roy (May 23, 1995). "Video game of the week: 'Nickelodeon: Guts". ''Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|title=Nickelodeon Guts|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12526|website=[[AllGame]]|accessdate=July 31, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114190152/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12526|archivedate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' praised the game's graphics, but criticized the poor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Guts|url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20067%20December%201994#page/n111/mode/1up|website=Nintendo Power|accessdate=July 31, 2017|date=December 1994|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crossover==
In the episode of ''[[Sanjay and Craig]]'' "G.U.T.S. Busters", the boys competed in the game show itself. [[Mike O'Malley]] and [[Moira Quirk|Moira "Mo" Quirk]] also guest starred in the episode as themselves.

'''''Nitro Circus''''' is an "action sport collective" led by [[Travis Pastrana]], featuring his friends and him traveling around the world riding dirtbikes, base jumping, and performing stunts. It has spawned a tour, a second television series based on the tour, and a 3D feature film.

==History==

===DVDs===
The collective began by releasing about 10 DVDs during the early 2000s.   Good sales led to the creation of the television show.

Jim DeChamp suffered a serious back injury on June 29, 2011, while shooting for the 3D film. After undergoing surgery, his doctors indicated there was no spinal damage and that they expect him to make a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/action/fmx/news/story?id=6731513|title=DeChamp injured on 'Nitro Circus' set|last=Stewart|first=Ethan|date=July 2, 2011|website=ESPN|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">{{Distinguish|Non-sequitur (logic)}}

A '''non-sequitur''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|n|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|ɛ|k|w|ᵻ|t|ər}}; {{IPA-la|noːn ˈsɛkᶣɪtʊr|classical}} "it does not follow") is a conversational [[Literary technique|literary device]], often used for comedic purposes. It is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; seems [[Absurdity|absurd]] to the point of being humorous or confusing.

This use of the term is distinct from the [[Non-sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur in logic]], where it is a [[fallacy]].

==Etymology==
The expression is [[Latin]] for "it does not follow."&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary. http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/non%20sequitur&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from the words "non" meaning not, and the [[Deponent verb|deponent]] verb ''sequor'', ''sequi'', ''secutus sum'' meaning 'to follow'. Deponent verbs have passive forms but active meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/Deponent.pdf|title=The Latin Library "Deponent Verbs"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
A non-sequitur can denote an abrupt, illogical, or unexpected turn in plot or dialogue by including a relatively inappropriate change in manner. A non-sequitur joke sincerely has no explanation, but it reflects the idiosyncrasies, mental frames and alternative world of the particular [[comic persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first1=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThJJP4b21DwC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Parody: The Art that Plays with Art |publisher=Peter Lang Publishers |year=2010 |page=75 |isbn= 978-1433108693 |accessdate=2014-09-17 |quote=Along with a rhythmic pattern, these jokes, however absurd they may be, build dual frames of reference, if not alternative worlds entirely reflecting the idiosyncrasies of the individual stand-up artist. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opsis''' ({{lang-grc|ὄψις}}) is the Greek word for [[spectacle]] in the [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. Its first use has been traced back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]].'' It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the [[mise en scène]] of a performance or theatrical event.

==Origins==

Opsis comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for "appearance, sight, view."&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%29%2Fyeis&amp;la=greek#lexicon ὄψις] entry in Liddell-Scott disctionary at the Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; The English word [[optic]] is derived from this word.

==Aristotle and the Greeks==

Aristotle's use of the term opsis, as [[Marvin Carlson]] points out, is the "final element of tragedy," but the term "receive[d] no further consideration".&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Carlson, Marvin | title = ''Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present'' | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8014-8154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kennydominican.joyeurs.com/GreekClassics/AristotlePoetics.htm Aristotle - Poetics], Translated by S. H. Butcher, with original Greek text&lt;/ref&gt; but only goes as far as to suggest that "spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet".&lt;ref name="Dukore"&gt;{{cite book | author = DUKORE, Bernard Frank | title = ''Dramatic theory and criticism: Greeks to Grotowski'' | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-0-03-091152-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Theories of the Theatre'' by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent "spectacle," but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' Opsis is listed in the "terms" section, and defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
that which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the notions of ''spectacle'' and ''performance''. In Aristotle's ''Poetics, spectacle'' is one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the performance. ''Opsis'' is a spectific feature of the performing arts.&lt;ref name="Pavis"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pavis, Patrice, Christine Shantz, Marvin Carlson | title = ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-8020-8163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J. Michael Walton, in ''The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed'', challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that “the visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.” Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word.

Ronald W. Vince, suggests that while it may &lt;blockquote&gt;
seem logical simply to recognize ''opsis'' as stage spectacle or the ''mise-en-scene'' and so include it — if anywhere — in the vocabulary of performance theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible interpretation which would link ''opsis'' with the art of writing plays as well as with the art of staging them.&lt;ref name="Vince"&gt;{{cite book | author = Vince | title = Opsis as a Term in Dramatic Theory | year = 1990 | journal = Assaph C, no 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.  But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that ''he'' is no singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohencentric.com/2015/06/22/rarely-viewed-video-leonard-cohen-on-his-atrocious-voice-dylan-lead-belly-ice-t-songwriting-love-wheres-the-beef/|title=1992 Video: Leonard Cohen On His Atrocious Voice, Dylan, Ice-T, Songwriting, Love &amp; Where's The Beef|date=22 June 2015|work=cohencentric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

'''''Our Little Genius''''' is a [[game show]] produced for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network that was pulled before making it to air, hosted by [[Kevin Pollak]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-pollak-turns-genius-91959|title = Kevin Pollak turns "Genius"|first = James|last = Hibberd|date = December 3, 2009|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was slated to premiere on Fox on January 13, 2010, at 9:15 PM Eastern following ''[[American Idol]]'' with a special 45-minute episode, with further episodes being 60 minutes.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/fox-debut-mark-burnett-our-little-genius-game-show-january-13-9993.php|title = FOX to debut Mark Burnett's "Our Little Genius" game show January 13|first = Christopher|last = Rocchio|date = November 25, 2009|work = Reality TV World|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the show was postponed on request by its creator and eventually [[list of television series canceled before airing an episode|canceled]] before any episodes aired due to two separate issues related to the show's integrity.

According to Fox, [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] would answer trivia questions to win money for their families; their parents would be able to appeal to experts for help.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
The show's producers were (in alphabetical order): Noah Bonnett, Mark Burnett, Lauren Franson, Ron Muccianti, Dave Schapiro, Tod Schellinger, John Stevens, Jenny Tyson and Chris Wagner.  Music was produced by David Vanacore. The film editors were Robert M. Malachowski Jr. and Hudson Smith. The casting department was Jennifer Cron and Joshua Robinson.

==Removal from schedule==
On January 7, 2010, one week before its scheduled premiere, the show's creator, [[Mark Burnett]], announced that he'd asked Fox to postpone it due to concerns about its integrity. Burnett said that issues with how information was relayed to contestants were serious enough that he felt compelled to reshoot the episodes. Fox supported Burnett's decision, and added that all contestants would keep their winnings.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"&gt;Wyatt, Edward. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/business/media/08genius.html Integrity Concerns Force Fox to Postpone Child Quiz Show]. [[The New York Times]], 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that some contestants may have known what questions were going to be asked (though not the answers) rather than just the topics to be covered.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Burnett's main concern was that contestants somehow got more information than they should have prior to taping.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Maria Elena.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2010-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the abrupt pulling of the series, ''[[American Idol]]'' aired for 90 minutes that night, with a repeat showing of the "[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' following at 9:30 PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003 |title=Fox’s Our Little Genius Pulled From Schedule, Will It Return?|last1=Gorman|first1=Bill |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.com |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=2016-09-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110020712/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003|archivedate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "variety-fox-pulls-little-genius"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013460.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title = FOX Pulls "Our Little Genius"|last = Schneider|first = Michael|date = January 7, 2010|work = Variety|accessdate = January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of cheating==
''The New York Times'' reported that a member of the production team gave a prospective contestant and his parents specific answers to at least four questions. If the show were found to be deliberately rigged, it would mark the first known instance of such a deception in America since the [[quiz show scandals]] of the late 1950s. Rigging a game show is a felony under the [[Communications Act of 1934]] ({{usc|47|509}}), which was added to the law in 1960 in the wake of the scandals.  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has opened an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Edward [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/business/media/20genius.html F.C.C.

'''Performance art''' is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

==Visual arts, performing arts, art performance==
[[File:Lubo Kristek,2007,Requiem für die Mobiltelephone,Wien.jpg|thumb|left|''Requiem für die Mobiltelephone'' by [[Lubo Kristek]], 2007, [[Vienna]]]]
Performance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like "democracy" or "art", it implies productive disagreement with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 1, 2 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]] and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to [[theatre]], challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art | editors = Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-10-26 | isbn = 0748618996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 103–105 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a [[conceptual art]] which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any [[performing arts]] such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|left|Conceptual work by [[Yves Klein]] at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960, photo by Shunk Kender. ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (''Leap into the Void'')]]
Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, [[Angie Hobbs]], Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; [[Miriam Griffin]], Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and [[John Moles]], Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with [[Melvyn Bragg]] the idea that [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] which means "dog" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.

Western cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Dada]]. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], by the likes of [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. [[Russian Futurist]] artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as [[David Burliuk]], who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and his wife [[Varvara Stepanova]].

According to the art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1940s and 1950s [[Action Painting]] gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as "an arena in which to act", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[Action painting]] preceded the [[Fluxus movement]], [[Happenings]] and the emergence of Performance Art.

Performance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by [[Japan]]'s [[Gutai group]] of the 1950s, especially in such works as [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]'s ''Electric Dress'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yves Klein]] had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]'' (''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'') 1959–62, ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s [[Land art|Earth artists]] as diverse as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michael Heizer]] and [[Carl Andre]] created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like [[Sol LeWitt]], who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.

==1960s==
[[Image:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.]]
In the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art.  Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled "performance art", were works of artists like [[Yoko Ono]] with her ''Wall piece for orchestra'' (1962), [[Carolee Schneemann]] with pieces like ''Meat Joy'' (1964) and ''Interior Scroll'' (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolf Vostell]] with his Happening ''YOU'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: YOU|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=12 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964 in New York); [[Joseph Beuys]] with ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare'' (1965); [[Yayoi Kusama]], with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and [[Allan Kaprow]] in his many ''Happenings''.

Kaprow had coined the term [[Happening]] describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A ''Happening'' allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was "Happenings in the New York Scene," written in 1961 as the form was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. The New Media Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.: MIT, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include [[Jim Dine]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]: ''Theater is in the Street'' (Paris in 1958).

[[Hermann Nitsch]] in 1962 presented his "Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.

[[Andy Warhol]] during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_films.html|title=Andy Warhol Films|author=|date=|website=www.warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-60s sponsored the [[Velvet Underground]] and staged events and performances in New York, like the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Living Theatre]] and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]] in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'' was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.

The work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. [[Barbara T. Smith]] with ''Ritual Meal'' (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: [[Carolee Schneemann]], and [[Joan Jonas]]. Schneemann and Jonas along with [[Yoko Ono]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] pioneered the relationship between ''[[Body art]]'' and performance art.

At the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.

New artists with radical performances were [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 performance piece ''Shoot'', in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and [[Vito Acconci]] in the same year with ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]''.

The book ''[[Expanded Cinema]]'', by [[Gene Youngblood]], marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions [[Jud Yalkut]] as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with [[Nam June Paik]], who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and [[Robert Whitman]] from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Youngblood | first1 = Gene | title = Expanded Cinema | publisher = A. Dutton | year = 1970 | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-based pair [[Gilbert and George]], already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their "living sculpture" performance, being painted in gold and singing "Underneath The Arches" for extended periods. [[Joan Jonas]] began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.

In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] performed ''Duets on Ice'', on the streets of New York City. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', conceptually included the violation of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/ | title = Marina Abramović Rhythm 10 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = Media Art Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as  Clifford Owens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=9 March 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Walsh, [[Pat Oleszko]] and [[Rebecca Patek]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0 |title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=30 July 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.

[[Carolee Schneemann]] work in 1963, ''Eye Body'', already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like ''Interior Scroll'', showing the female body as an artistic medium.

In the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged [[Orshi Drozdik]] performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced "emancipation program", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.

In 1976, [[HA Schult]] filled [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]] with old newspapers in an overnight action he called ''Venezia vive.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas, ''The Art of Performance: A Critical Anthology'' (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton, 1984), pp. 330-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Wines, ''De-Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli International, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 performance, "Crash", the same artist let a [[Cessna]] crash into the garbage dump on [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Art in the Seventies'' (Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the [[avant-garde]] of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

Until the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 120, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''Presence and Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auslander | first1 = Philip | title = Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1992 | location = Ann Arbour | pages = 64–65, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philip Auslander]], dance critic [[Sally Banes]] writes "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; [[mass culture]], especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Ann Magnuson]], had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 10, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[RoseLee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500203393|title=Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present|first=Roselee|last=Goldberg|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by [[Linda Montano]] and [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece), and [[Karen Finley]]'s ''I'm an Ass Man'' 1987.

Until the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map - media archive performance | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archivedate = 2011-04-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1982, [[Hedwig Gorski]] designated the term [[performance poetry]], to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist [[PINK de Thierry]] created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.

== 1990s ==
[[File:Trash People Roma 2007.JPG|thumb|''Trash People'' by [[HA Schult]], Rome, 2007]]
While the [[Soviet bloc]] disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like [[György Galántai]] in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like [[Zhang Huan]] had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s [[Chinese performance art]] already was acclaimed in the international art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, [[HA Schult]] has installed one thousand life sized "Trash People" made from garbage as "silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide". They travelled to [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] (1999), the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] (2002) and the [[Great Wall of China]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaIwmEh-OpsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carlos Rojas, ''The Great Wall: A Cultural History''] (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina-Maria Greverus and Ute Ritschel, eds., ''Aesthetics and Anthropology: Performing Life, Performed Lives'' (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Levin]], ''ARTnews'', volume=6, 2011, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Targ Brill | first1 = Marlene | title = America in the 1990s | publisher = Lerner Publishing Group | year = 2009 | pages = 93, 1 | location = Minneapolis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BNXeIFQScocC&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;q=performance#v=snippet&amp;q=performance&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 978-0-8225-7603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate (2009), [https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/09/horrifically-bad-software-demos-become-performance-art.ars "Horrifically bad software demo becomes performance art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of [[Marina Abramović]]'s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history.&lt;ref&gt;Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010).

Retrieved 2010-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the run of the exhibition, Abramović performed ''The Artist is Present'', a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium, while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yazmany-arboleda/bringing-marina-flowers_b_592597.html|title=SBringing Marina Flowers|last=Arboleda|first=Yazmany|authorlink=Yazmany Arboleda|date=May 28, 2010|newspaper=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2010-06-16|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vy37wSbU?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yazmany-arboleda/bringing-marina-flowers_b_592597.html|archivedate=2011-01-24|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A support group for the "sitters", "Sitting with Marina", was established on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=122578407758954%22|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance attracted celebrities such as [[Björk]] and [[James Franco]] and received coverage on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoughtcatalog.com/2010/marina-abramovic-the-staring-woman-at-moma/ thoughtcatalog.com/2010/marina-abramovic]&lt;/ref&gt; During Marina's performance, other artists performed for her.

A '''practical joke''', or '''prank''', is a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/practical%20joke?fromAsk=true&amp;o=100074 |title= Practical joke|publisher = Dictionary.com|accessdate= 2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"&gt;Marsh, Moira. 2015. ''Practically Joking''. Logan: Utah State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-87421-983-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who performs a practical joke is called a "practical joker".&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; Other terms for practical jokes include '''gag''', '''jape''', or '''shenanigan'''.

Practical jokes differ from [[confidence trick]]s or [[hoax]]es in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes are generally lighthearted and without lasting impact; they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish, but not victimized or [[humiliation | humiliated]]. Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to encourage [[laughter]]. However, practical jokes performed with [[cruelty]] can constitute [[bullying]], whose intent is to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Relational Rituals and Communication: Ritual Interaction in Groups|page= 156

Some countries in [[Western culture]] traditionally emphasize the carrying out of practical jokes on [[April Fools' Day]].&lt;ref name=EconJape&gt;

==Description==

A practical joke is "practical" because it consists of someone doing something physical, in contrast to a verbal or written joke. For example, the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a [[door]]way and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. [[practical joke device|Objects]] can also be used in practical jokes, like [[fake vomit]], [[chewing gum bug]]s, [[exploding cigar]]s, [[stink bomb]]s, [[costume]]s and [[whoopee cushion]]s.

Practical jokes often occur inside [[office]]s, usually to surprise co-workers. Covering the computer accessories with Jell-O, wrapping the desk with Christmas paper or aluminium foil or filling it with balloons are just some examples of office pranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.weirdomatic.com/funny-office-pranks.html |title=Funny Office Pranks|publisher =Weirdomatic.com|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical jokes are also common occurrences during [[sleepover]]s, whereby teens will play pranks on their friends as they come into the home, enter a room or even as they sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.terrysblinds.co.uk/infographics/10-pranks-to-play-on-friends/ |title=Funny Sleepover Pranks|publisher =Terrysblinds.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American humorist [[H. Allen Smith]] wrote a 320-page book in 1953 called ''The Compleat Practical Joker'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03705-4}}) that contains numerous examples of practical jokes. The book became a best seller not only in the United States but also in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|magazine=Publishers Weekly|volume=209|page=2:24

|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Marsh has written an entire volume about practical jokes.&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"/&gt; One of her findings is that in the USA they are more often done by males than females.

== Famous examples ==

A practical joke recalled as his favorite by the [[playwright]] [[Charles MacArthur]], concerns the American painter and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] character [[Waldo Peirce]]. While living in [[Paris]] in the 1920s, Peirce "made a gift of a very big [[turtle]] to the woman who was the [[concierge]] of his building". The woman doted on the turtle and lavished care on it. A few days later Peirce substituted a somewhat larger turtle for the original one. This continued for some time, with larger and larger turtles being surreptitiously introduced into the woman's apartment. The concierge was beside herself with happiness and displayed her miraculous turtle to the entire neighborhood. Peirce then began to sneak in and replace the turtle with smaller and smaller ones, to her bewildered distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fun Fare: a Treasury of Reader's Digest Wit and Humor|page=36

Modern and successful pranks often take advantage of the modernization of tools and techniques. In Canada, engineering students have a reputation for annual pranks; at the [[University of British Columbia]] these usually involve leaving a Volkswagen Beetle in an unexpected location (such as suspended from the Golden Gate Bridge&lt;ref&gt;Curiel, Jonathan.

Not unlike the [[Stone Louse]] of Germany, in the American West the [[jackalope]] has become an institutionalized practical joke perennially perpetrated by ruralites (as a class) on [[tourism|tourists]], most of whom have never heard of the decades-old myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Deception|page=555

The 2003 TV movie ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', consists of an elaborate practical joke on the film's star, Perry Caravallo, who is led to believe that he is starring in a faux action film, ''Windy City Heat'', where the filming which is ostensibly for the film's DVD extras actually documents the long chain of pranks and jokes performed at Caravallo's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Grantland|title=The Greatest Trick Comedy Ever Pulled|date=2013-11-12|first=Steven|last=Hyden|url=http://grantland.com/features/windy-city-heat-10-years-later-history-comedy-store/|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prestige pictures are largely the province of major [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios—such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]]—that produce numerous films every year.

'''Rhetorical modes''' (also known as '''modes of discourse''') describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of [[language]]-based [[communication]], particularly [[writing]] and [[speaking]]. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Narrative mode|narration]], [[description]], [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]].{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}  The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in ''A Practical System of Rhetoric'' in 1827.{{sfn|Connors|1981|p=445}} 

==Narration==
{{further|Exposition (narrative)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of [[narrative mode|narration]] is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Exposition==
Expository writing is a type of [[writing]] where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Arnetha F.|title=Expository Writing|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~arnetha/expowrite/info.html|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|title=Expository Writing|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/e/g/Expository-Writing-term.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In [[narrative]] contexts (such as [[history]] and [[fiction]]), [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] provides background information to teach or entertain. In other [[nonfiction]] contexts (such as [[technical communication]]), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}
* Business
**[[Business letter]]s
**[[Report]]s
**[[News release|Press releases]]
* Journalism
**[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]]
**[[Article (publishing)|News article]]
* Personal
**[[Personal letter]]s
**[[Will (law)|Wills]]
* Academic and [[technical communication]]

**[[Academic writing]]
***[[Term paper]]s
***[[Textbook]]s
***General [[reference work]]s
****[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]]
**[[Technical writing]]
***[[User guide]]s
***[[Technical standard]]s

==Argumentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:
*[[Copywriting|Advertising copy]]
*[[review|Critical review]]
*[[Editorial]]s
*[[Job evaluation]]
*[[Job application]] letter
*[[Letter of recommendation]]
*[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]]
*[[Résumé]]s

Another form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is [[Jonathan Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]".

==Fiction-writing modes==
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''seating plan''' is a [[diagram]] or a set of written or spoken instructions that determines where people should take their seats. It is widely used on diverse occasions. 

Seating plans have a wide range of purposes. At formal [[dinner]]s, they are usually used to avoid chaos and confusion upon entrance and to follow the [[etiquette]]. In this case, it is customary to arrange the [[Hospitality|host]] and hostess at the opposite sides of the table, and alternate male and female guests throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Oretha D. Swartz|title=Service Etiquette|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1988|isbn=9780870216206|pages=267-278}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Place card]]s can be used to direct guests. [[State dinner]]s have their own protocol and arrangements are made so that the most distinguished guests can have the possibility to engage in conversation. Plans are also made for [[airplanes]], where the objective is to differentiate [[passenger]]s between the various [[Travel class|travel classes]] and ensure everybody has a place. Similarly, [[theatre]]s or [[movie theatre|cinema]]s may allow spectators to choose their seats beforehand. A seating plan is of crucial importance for [[musical ensemble]]s or [[orchestra]]s, where every type of [[Musical instrument|instrument]] is allocated a specific section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Band &amp; Orchestra: Methods and Materials|author=Lynn G.

'''Self-working [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]''' is [[stage magic|magic]] that works simply from following a procedure that is known to the audience. It requires no secret set-up, trickery, [[sleight-of-hand]], or other hidden objects or moves. Some self-working magic allows the audience to have a secret that they do not reveal to the magician until the end. The audience can be told every step, and can even repeat the trick. It can be done alone, since the "magician" may be just as surprised as anybody. All the magician has to do is follow a certain procedure, and everything will be good. [[Optical illusion]]s and some other science demonstrations could fall into this category. The wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon. Basically, self-working magic relies on some expectation or lack of knowledge in the audience about what produces the outcome. Usually, self-working [[card trick]]s revolve around some mathematical principle, such as in the trick "Magical 13", where the spectator is asked to cut the deck 13 times, then split the deck into 13 piles. Upon revealing each pile, it is found that each pile contains only cards of the same value (i.e., one pile has all four fours, the other pile has all four twos, etc.). This is based on the principle that beforehand, the deck is set up with all the suits in order. No matter how many times you cut the deck, the same cards will always be 13 cards away from each other.

==Example==
Self-working magic tricks can be baffling in a special way. The [[patter]] can take different forms that make them more entertaining. One variation of patter is to say that you are hiding nothing, and explaining every step of the trick. Some audience members may still think it is a trick. Another variation, possibly with some tricks, is to say, "I will not be doing the magic, here: you will". Another way of doing it is to make a story that explains—gives a reason to—each step, so that no step is hidden, and the audience can even DO the steps, but the audience members are baffled, anyway.

Story: Make a story of cutting the deck 7 times. 7 drunken sailors decide to play a high-stakes poker game with a new deck of cards. (Use a new deck that is ordered correctly for this game, all cards in order in every suit, not backwards order as some decks have, or have the audience put the cards in order to simulate a new deck). Then say, none of them are in a state of mind to shuffle, so they decide to cut the deck 7 times, one time each. The dealer deals but forgets his own 2nd and 4th cards, so he ends up with 3 cards. He asks for 2 more, but the other sailors refuse, arguing, but none of them want to start the round over. They finally agree to let him get 5 new cards. They make their bets, and each sailor bets high, giving up everything he owns. The dealer bets last, and accepts all the bets. Everybody is all in. Finally, they reveal their cards, the dealer revealing last. Every drunken sailor has a full house. But the dealer rarely loses the hand, having usually a straight flush, and sometimes a royal straight flush. Every step of the trick has been told directly to the audience, but they are still amazed.

No magic, here. Say, "No magic, here. You will tell me which cards you picked." Ask the audience to pick 3 cards, not show them to you, and write them down. Make a pile of 10 cards, a pile of 15, another pile of 15, and a pile of 9, in order (no Jokers in the deck). Ask the audience to place the first card face down on the first deck. Then, take any number of cards from the 2nd deck and place them on the 1st. Put the 2nd card on top of the 2nd deck, and put any number of cards from the 3rd deck onto the 2nd deck. Put the 3rd card on top of the 3rd deck. Now, you put the 4th pile on the 3rd, both on the 2nd, and all 3 on the 1st. You have one deck. Take 4 cards from the top and put them on the bottom. You can tell the audience every step you are doing. Now, you can get 0 points to 3 points. I will go thru the deck, and you grab your cards if you see them. If you grab all 3 by the end, you get 3 points, if you grab 1, you get one point, and so on.

Now, put the 1st card face up, the 2nd face down. They will find no cards. Say that is OK, we will keep going. Pick up the face-down deck and keep going. Do it again, and again. They will never see their card. Stop when only 3 cards are left. And say, gee—only 3 cards left. Turn them over, and there are their 3 cards. It works every single time. Sometimes, you can arrange it so that they do not know that they had to memorize the cards after writing them down. They may pick the wrong cards. Show them that they picked the wrong cards by looking at their paper. They will think the trick is over. Then, reveal the correct 3 cards.

==Popular types==
1. Steps of math operations that use some secret knowledge of the audience like their birthday, and then reveal that secret knowledge in an unexpected way at the end. For example, think of any secret 3-digit number, multiply it by one specific number, and then another, and it always comes out a 6-digit number with the original 3
-digit number repeated twice.

2. Another one asks the audience to think of words that start with certain letters, and then words linked to the last letters of those words, asking the audience to reveal only their last choices, but somehow almost always ends with the words "Grey elephant in Denmark" even though the audience thought up their own words throughout the steps.

3. Another one ends up with the audience getting all the same number, but it is the WRONG number! Like an optical illusion, people are susceptible to adding up this particular sequence the wrong way almost every time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]

[[Image:Shemahinskaya boyaderka 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A dancer from [[Shamakhi]]. [[Grigory Gagarin|G.Gagarin]], mid-19th century]]
The '''Shamakhi dancers''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Şamaxı rəqqasələri'') were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in [[Shamakhi]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to [[tawaif]]s.

[[Russia]]n painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] who lived in the [[Caucasus]] in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as ''bayaderki''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cultur/359/ Ими восхищался Дюма] by Emil Karimov and Mehpara Aliyeva. ''Azeri.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; (баядерки; sg. ''bayaderka'' – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term ''balliadera'' borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (''bayadère'') and initially used to refer to the [[devadasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayadère. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved February 1st, 2008 from Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in [[Arthur Gobineau|Comte de Gobineau]]'s novel ''The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales''.

''The Dancer of Shamakha'' recounts the life of Armenian dancer [[Armen Ohanian]], her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as ''La Danseuse de Shamakha'' in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by [[Rose Wilder]].  After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles.  She eventually moved to Mexico.  She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, Armen.  ''La Danseuse de Shamakha''.  Forward by Anatole France. Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1918

Each world is built on a [[game engine]] called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for ''SAO'' by [[List of Sword Art Online characters#Heathcliff|Akihiko Kayaba]], but was later duplicated for ''ALO'', and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry.

===Plot===
In 2022, a virtual reality [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (VRMMORPG) called ''Sword Art Online'' (''SAO'') is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.

On November 6, 10,000 players log into the ''SAO''{{'}}s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of ''SAO'', if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.

One of the players, named [[Kirito (Sword Art Online)|Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya]], is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous [[closed beta]]. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a [[portmanteau]] of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named [[Asuna (Sword Art Online)|Asuna Yuuki]], forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.

In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 ''SAO'' players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another ''SAO'' survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on "The [[Yggdrasil|World Tree]]" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called ''Alfheim Online'' (''ALO''). Assisted in-game by his cousin [[Leafa|Suguha "Leafa" Kirigaya]] and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from ''SAO''), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ''ALO'' are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 ''SAO'' players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ''ALO'' to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a [[Package (package management system)|package]] program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.

Soon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called ''Gun Gale Online'' (''GGO''), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named [[Sinon (Sword Art Online)|Shino "Sinon" Asada]], he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in ''SAO''. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.

Kazuto is later recruited to assist in testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with [[suxamethonium chloride]]. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that UnderWorld was created as part of an experiment to create [[artificial intelligence]] that could be used for military purposes.

[[Reki Kawahara]] wrote the first volume in 2002 as a competition entry for [[ASCII Media Works]]' {{nihongo|Dengeki Game Novel Prize|電撃ゲーム小説大賞|Dengeki Game Shōsetsu Taishō|extra=now [[Dengeki Novel Prize]]}}, but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori.&lt;ref name="afterword vol.1"&gt;Afterword of the first light novel volume&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he added three further episodes and several short stories.&lt;ref&gt;Afterword of the sixth light novel volume&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordgear novel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|author=Fumio Kunori (Reki Kawahara)|title=web novel|work=WordGear|language=Japanese|accessdate=July 7, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EV8ijtat?url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|archivedate=February 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing ''[[Accel World]]'', this time winning the Grand Prize. Aside from ''Accel World'', he was requested to get his earlier work, ''Sword Art Online'', published by ASCII Media Works.&lt;ref name="afterword vol.1" /&gt; He agreed and withdrew his web novel versions.&lt;ref name="wordgear novel" /&gt;

For the character protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters,&lt;ref name="inquisitr"/&gt; and jokingly remarked: "but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]]. We [both] tend to play solo in these games a lot."&lt;ref name="figure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.figure.fm/en/post/47517/Interview+with+Kawahara+Reki+Sakura+Con+2013.html |title=Interview with Kawahara Reki @ Sakura-Con 2013 |publisher=figure.fm |accessdate=August 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826004522/http://www.figure.fm/en/post/47517/Interview+with+Kawahara+Reki+Sakura+Con+2013.html |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that the female characters in the story were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, stating: "I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable."&lt;ref name="inquisitr"/&gt; He added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, but rather decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels.&lt;ref name="inquisitr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2055209/sword-art-online-season-3-and-2-kawahara-reki-talks-sao-accel-world-anime-and-future-plans/ |author=Frye, Patrick |title='Sword Art Online' Season 2 and 3: Kawahara Reki talks SAO, 'Accel World', anime, and future plans |publisher=Inquisitr|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that "the character of Asuna I might have created a little too perfectly for ''Sword Art Online''".&lt;ref name="figure"/&gt;

Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] hails ''Sword Art Online'' as the smartest series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the psychological aspects of [[virtual reality]] on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a [[massively multiplayer online game]] setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle a wide variety of genres within the series.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|title=''Sword Art Online'' Is the Smartest Anime I’ve Seen in Years (And It’s Only Half-Done)|publisher=Kotaku|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406060444/http://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|archivedate=April 6, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing "definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world."&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1" /&gt; However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis1" /&gt; He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied on the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, "Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|title=''Sword Art Online''{{'}}s Second Half Isn't Quite as Brilliant as Its First|publisher=Kotaku|date=December 26, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926162313/http://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''telematic performance''' refers to a live performance (art, dance, music, etc.) which makes use of [[telecommunications]] and [[information technology]] to distribute the performers between two or more locations.

While this may involve use of conventional [[videoconferencing]] technology, it has more recently come to mean the use of internet technologies. Performance groups my also refer to their events as ''internet concerts'', ''online jamming'', or ''teleconcerts''.

==History==
On June 21, 1982, The first International Summer Solstice Radio Broadcast.  Created by Charlie Morrow. Produced by New Wilderness Foundation and WNYC FM. Celebrating the first day of summer (and winter below the equator) with a satellite mix of live events in Sweden, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, and Italy. The solstice jam in real time concluded the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/arts/druids-mark-solstice-euphoniously.html |title='DRUIDS' MARK SOLSTICE EUPHONIOUSLY |last1=Rockwell |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=22 June 1982 |website= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2012, a ghostpianist concert has been realized in Berlin Philharmonie. Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda played Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante op. 22 on a Yamaha Clavinova digital piano in the backstage of the hall,  sending the midi signal in real time to the robot-pianist Teo Tronico, which acted as a mirrorpianist, mirroring Prosseda's performance on the Steinway grand piano on stage with Berliner Symphoniker conducted by Michelangelo Galeati.

==Issues==
Performers and researchers work to overcome the following obstacles:

# '''Audio latency:'''  Most musicians who play in a group rely on audio cues to maintain tempo and other communication.  The most obvious example is the use of a drummer in pop music to keep time. In a normal rehearsal or performance environment, there is a delay between the time one musician plays and another hears the sound due to the speed of sound in air. This is typically from 3 - 50ms. When audio is transmitted through a digital medium (i.e. the Internet), the delay (or [[Latency (audio)|latency]]) can be much longer. Cell phones have latency of approximately 50ms. Applications such as Skype have approximately 100ms. And, QuickTime and Windows Media server-based streaming systems add 8 or more seconds of latency. When the latency is too high, the audio cues are no longer effective. Researchers&lt;ref name='lester_boley'&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lester, M, &amp; Boley, J. | title=The Effects of Latency on Live Sound Monitoring | journal=Audio Engineering Society | year=2007 }}{{Full|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--volume number, inclusive pages, and the specific page reference for this citation are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  have shown that some musicians can ignore this delay while others find it obtrusive.  In general, the higher the audio quality and the more channels transmitted, the higher the latency needs to be to reliably transmit the audio stream.
# '''Echo cancellation:''' Since the latency between locations is much higher than the speed of sound, standard techniques to eliminate feedback from monitoring systems, such as [equalization], do not work. However, when the latency between locations is low enough, teleconferencing [[echo cancellation]] techniques can be used.
# '''Video latency:''' Musicians also rely on visual cues to maintain synchronization. The most obvious example is the use of a conductor with orchestral music. Due to the size of video data, latency tends to higher for video than audio latency.
# '''Audio/video synchronization:''' In order to maintain audio and video synchronization, audio may be delayed more than necessary. Some performers opt to sacrifice AV synchronization for lower audio latency. For example, those involved with [[improvised]], musical telematic performances may require low latency audio cues.

'''The California Raisins''' were a [[fictional]] [[rhythm and blues]] [[virtual band|animated musical group]] as well as [[advertising character|advertising]] and merchandising characters composed of  [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[raisins]]. Lead vocals were sung by musician [[Buddy Miles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/arts/music/28cnd-miles.html?hp |title= Buddy Miles, Hendrix Drummer, Dies |first= Jon |last= Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Raisins concept experienced high popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s principally through [[clay animation|claymation]] [[Television advertisement|TV commercials]] and [[animation|animated]] [[television special|specials]], winning an [[Emmy Award]] and one nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/21/arts/tv-review-claymation-christmas-on-cbs.html |title=TV Review; 'Claymation Christmas,' On CBS |work= The New York Times |date=December 21, 1987 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-12/news/tv-509_1_california-raisins |title=On View: A Feat of Clay: The Creator of California Raisins Molds an Animated Easter Special |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 12, 1992 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and success==
The concept was originally created for a 1986 [[Sun-Maid]] commercial on behalf of the [[California Raisin Advisory Board]] when one of the writers, Seth Werner (at the time with the advertising firm Foote, Cone &amp; Belding SF, and now with big) came up with an idea for the new raisin commercial, saying, "We have tried everything but dancing raisins singing '[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]'" (the 1968 song popularized by [[Marvin Gaye]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Stardom Is Feat Of Clay For California Raisins|work= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|date= January 25, 1988 |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-01-25/lifestyle/0010260008_1_california-raisins-stardom-critical-acclaim|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To their surprise, the commercial became wildly popular, paving the way for several future commercials and opportunities through other media. The commercials were produced by [[Will Vinton|Vinton Studios]] using their [[claymation]] technique, with character designs by Michael Brunsfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Corliss |first= Richard |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/18/bad-25-spike-lee-brings-michael-jackson-back-to-thrilling-life/ |title= Bad 25: Spike Lee Brings Michael Jackson Back to Thrilling Life |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Raisins appeared in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[A Claymation Christmas Celebration]]'', singing the [[Christmas carol]] "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]".

The California Raisins released four [[studio album]]s on [[Priority Records]] between 1987 and 1988, and their signature song, "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," landed on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, the Raisins would continue to make their strongest impression through animated endeavors, and the characters proved popular enough that they were used to endorse [[Post Consumer Brands|Post]]'s [[Raisin Bran]] cereal.

On November 4, 1988, [[CBS]] aired a primetime special entitled ''[[Meet the Raisins!]]''. The musical [[mockumentary]] was again created by Vinton Studios and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Primetime Emmy Award]]. It also provided the band members more personality and individual names: A.C., Beebop (drums), Stretch (bass), and Red (guitar/piano). A [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] series, ''[[The California Raisin Show]]'', debuted the following year but lasted merely 13 episodes. While [[cel animation|cel animated]] by [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson]], it maintained Will Vinton's creative direction. A sequel to the original CBS special aired in 1990 under the title ''The Raisins: Sold Out!: The California Raisins II''. This special saw the Raisins hiring a new manager with the goal of making a comeback.

==Merchandise==
Many of the items created for the campaign have become part of the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Merchandise sales included toys and Raisins images on nearly every conceivable medium: [[lunch box]]es, notebooks, clothing, [[posters]], bedsheets, and even a [[Halloween costume]] just to name a few. A California Raisins Fan Club began in 1987 which included a Grapevine Gazette Newsletter and various memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wharble.com/California_Raisins_Collectibles.htm |title= California Raisins Collectibles |work= Wharble.com |access-date= May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blackthorne Publishing]] also released a 6-issue [[comic book]] series entitled ''The California Raisins 3-D'' which included [[Stereoscopy#3D viewers|3D glasses]]; these would later be re-released in the ''Ultimate Collection'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].

Several California Raisins music albums were also released, featuring classic [[Motown]] and rock standards. These albums were included in the Smithsonian collection and were illustrated and art-directed by [[Helane Freeman]], who later became famous for her work on ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'', among other [[Disney]] programs.

Perhaps the most memorable piece of California Raisins merchandise, however, came in the form of small, non-poseable California Raisins figures. The [[Hardee's]] restaurant chain offered these as part of a promotion for their Cinnamon 'N' Raisin biscuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hardees.com/company/story/ |title= The Hardee's Story |publisher= Hardees |access-date= June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different collections were produced in 1987, 1988, 1991, and finally in 2001 (the latter adding [[Carls Jr.]] due to their late '90s acquisition of Hardee's) for their new stylization. This latest incarnation can still be seen on the California Raisin Marketing Board website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calraisins.org/raisins_home/ CalRaisins.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, [[Capcom]] produced a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] titled ''[[The California Raisins: The Grape Escape]]'',&lt;ref name="NP-9"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher = [[Nintendo]]| title = Pak Watch| page = 95| author = Nintendo Power Staff|date=November–December 1989| issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five [[side-scrolling]] levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins' music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.

==Decline==
Although popular with the public, the California Raisin campaign eventually failed because its production cost the raisin growers almost twice their earnings. [[California Raisin Advisory Board|CALRAB]], the organization who made the campaign, was also closed on July 31, 1994 due to disagreements with raisin producers over the fairness of required payments to the organization.

==Post-popularity and legacy==
On March 28, 1997 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' published "The 50 Best Commercials of All Time" as its [[Front cover|cover story]]. The article ranked The California Raisins' premiere advertisement, "Lunchbox," at #15 with comments by ad agency executive Claude Jacques and described the Raisins as "The coolest wrinkled musicians this side of the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287305_2,00.html |title= The 50 Best Commercials of All Time |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= March 28, 1997 |access-date= May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast amount of California Raisins merchandise has made for a substantial collectors' market. It even led to an unauthorized collectibles guide published in 1998, cataloging the many items based on the clay characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Collectible-California-Raisins-Unauthorized-Collectors/dp/076430433X |title= Collectible California Raisins: An Unauthorized Guide With Values |work= Amazon.com |access-date= May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Food Network]] program ''[[Unwrapped]]'' featured a segment on The California Raisins featuring interviews with [[Will Vinton]], David Altschul, and Mark Gustafson of Vinton Studios. Concept illustrations of the Raisins were also featured as interviewees discussed the characters' creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDN_C70xpZ8 |work= Unwrapped |title= The California Raisins |via= YouTube |access-date= June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[['Tis the Fifteenth Season]]", The California Raisins were spoofed as ''The California Prunes'', on a special entitled ''Christmas with the California Prunes''. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] dismisses it as "offensive to both [[Christians]] ''and'' prunes."

An article published by AnimateClay.com in the late 2000s details the whereabouts of the original claymation sculptures used by Vinton Studios. The figures were kept in a box for several years and headed for the trash before being obtained by Webster Colcord, a former employee of Vinton. Several photos were taken providing a close look at the Raisins' internal armatures and detailing their extremely poor condition, including the absence of the A.C. puppet's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Spess |first= Marc |url= http://www.animateclay.com/index.php/articles/69-behind-the-scenes/119-california-raisin-raisin-puppets-late-80s-early-90s |title= California Raisin Raisin Puppets: Late 80's - Early 90's |work= AnimateClay.com |date= April 18, 2010 |access-date= May 15, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143703/http://www.animateclay.com/index.php/articles/69-behind-the-scenes/119-california-raisin-raisin-puppets-late-80s-early-90s |archivedate= July 7, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010s, packages of [[Sun-Maid]] Natural California Raisins still modestly feature an updated California Raisin character. This figure is also included on [http://www.calraisins.org/ CalRaisins.org].

In 2010, [[Clay animation|claymation]] versions of the California Raisins were featured in the special [[Christmas]] episode of ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', '"A Very Sunny Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Zingale |first= Jason |url= http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2009/11/21/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-a-very-sunny-christmas/ |title= It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia: A Very Sunny Christmas |work= Premium Hollywood |date= November 21, 2009 |access-date= September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the California Raisins made a cameo appearance in the [[RadioShack]] [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] commercial "[[The '80s Called]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/tv/radioshack-super-bowl-commercial-every-80s-reference-in-the-ad-spot/ |title=Celebrating Every '80s Reference in That RadioShack Super Bowl Commercial |author=Jones, Nate |publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' called "[[The Cad and the Hat]]" included a couch gag segment featuring the California Raisins being killed by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Animation on FOX|title=Robot Chicken Couch Gag, Season 28 Ep. 14, ''The Simpsons'' |date=February 16, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzLju-4Su8|accessdate=February 23, 2017 |via= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an episode of ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'' called "[[Rififi (The Americans)|Rififi]]" feature a cereal box featuring the California Raisins on the back.

===Planned film===
In 2015, it was announced that a live-action/CGI reboot of the California Raisins would be produced, with president of The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation, Rusty Citron, as one of the people behind the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/california-raisins-set-for-comeback-in-live-actioncg-feature-exclusive-110510.html |title= California Raisins Set for Comeback in Live-Action Feature |work= Cartoon Brew.com |access-date= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury-Wonder-Show-1943.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Advertising herald for ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' (August 1943)]]
'''''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''''' was a 1943 magic-and-variety stage show by the [[Mercury Theatre]], produced by [[Orson Welles]] and [[Joseph Cotten]] as a morale-boosting entertainment for US soldiers in [[World War II]]. Directed by Welles, the show starred Welles ("Orson the Magnificent"), Cotten ("Jo-Jo the Great"), [[Agnes Moorehead]] ("[[Calliope]] Aggie") and [[Rita Hayworth]], whose part was later filled by [[Marlene Dietrich]]. [[Jean Gabin]] also worked on the show backstage, as a propman. The show ran to 150 minutes.

==Background==
[[File:Welles-Draft-1943.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Orson Welles leaving his Army physical examination after being judged unfit for military service (May 6, 1943)]]
In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'', ''[[Hello Americans]]'') that Orson Welles created for [[CBS Radio|CBS]] to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part [[circus]] and part [[magic (illusion)|magic show]]. He offered his services as magician and director,&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;Charvet, David, "Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show". ''[[Magic (magazine)|Magic, An Independent Magazine for Magicians]]'', Volume 2 Number 12, August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}} and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he called ''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay.&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}} The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

"It was just like a circus — I would have adored it if I'd been a member of the audience, I know that," Welles later told filmmaker [[Peter Bogdanovich]].&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|177|date=June 2014}}

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's [[Selective Service System|draft status]] in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F — unfit for military service — for a variety of medical reasons. "I felt guilty about the war," Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. "I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status."&lt;ref name="Leaming Hayworth"&gt;Leaming, Barbara, ''If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth''.

A portion of the stage show was filmed and included in the 1944 variety film, ''[[Follow the Boys]]''. The film segment was directed by Welles, uncredited.

Welles and Dietrich agreed to appear in the film while ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' was still running. The seven-minute segment was shot on the Universal lot in late September 1943. Welles traded his robe and fez for white tie and tails, and brought along a crew from the show — Shorty Chirello, Tommy Hanlon, Professor Bill and his Circus Symphony, Death Valley Mack, two female assistants and eight chorus girls. Welles performed a few illusions; his own appearance on stage and the comic version of the sawing-a-woman-in-half illusion featuring Dietrich were achieved with trick photography.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|184}} Welles received $30,000 for his part in the film. The segment was to be shot in four or five days, but Welles stretched filming to 16 days to give additional pay to his crew.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|185–186}}

'''''The Pocket Book of Boners''''' is a book illustrated by  Theodor Seuss Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]), originally published as four separate books in 1931–32 by [[The Viking Press]].  In 1941, Readers' League of America compiled these four books and published the ''Pocket Book of Boners''.&lt;ref name="1941note"&gt;Hansen, Harry (7 August 1941).

''The Pocket Book of Boners'' contains 22 illustrations of [[wikt:boner|boner]]s by [[Dr. Seuss]].  The rest of the volume consists of short jokes and humorous observations with most being no more than four lines long, and is notable for its early examples of [[Dr. Seuss]]' illustration style.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

The first book was released in February 1931.  A short positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Dr. Seuss's illustrations as "hilarious."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;(March 1, 1931).

'''''The Red Balloon''''' ({{lang-fr|Le ballon rouge}}) is a 1956 French [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy-drama]] [[featurette]] written, produced, and directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0048980|title=The Red Balloon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thirty-five-minute&lt;ref name=bbfc/&gt; short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the [[Ménilmontant]] neighbourhood of [[Paris]].

Lamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a little girl.

The film won numerous awards, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lamorisse for writing the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] in 1956 and the [[Short Film Palme d'Or|Palme d'Or for short films]] at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]]. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and to receive a nomination for anything besides [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]].

==Plot==
The film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his bedroom window, as his mother will not allow it in their apartment.

The balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up in his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like the red one.
One Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding [[beadle]].

In their wanderings around the neighborhood, Pascal and the balloon encounter a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon and attempt to steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery; however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch the balloon, throw stones at it, and bring it down with sling shots before one of the boys finish it off by stomping on it.

The film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a [[cluster balloon]] ride over the city.

==Themes==
As the film was filmed in [[Paris]] after World War II, its mise-en-scene is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood.  In contrast, the balloon's bright colour acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koresky|first1=Michael|title=The Red Balloon|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/655-the-red-balloon|website=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its "spirit" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said to be a metaphor for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alisashortfilm.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/the-red-balloon-1956/|title=The Red Balloon (1956)|date=2011-02-28|work=Notes on Short Film|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/778-the-red-balloon-written-on-the-wind|title=The Red Balloon: Written on the Wind|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child’s gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, “in a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader”. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BREEN|first=MYLES P.|date=1978|title=The Rhetoric of the Short Film|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20687433|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=30|issue=3|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film serves as a color record of the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous café "Au Repos de la Montagne", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the [[Parc de Belleville]]. Only the church still stands.

Albert Lamorrise was a former auditor at the [[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]] (IDHEC), and the crew that he used for the making of the film was entirely composed of IDHEC graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TESSONNEAU|first=RÉMY|last2=Ferguson|first2=Charles|date=1957|title=The French Institute Of Cinema (IDHEC)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20686478|journal=Journal of the University Film Producers Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered and opened nationwide in France on 19 October 1956; it was released in the United Kingdom on 23 December 1956 (as the supporting film to the 1956 Royal Performance Film ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'', which ensured it a [[Wide release|wide distribution]]) and in the United States on 11 March 1957.

It has been featured in many festivals over the years, including the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival; the Los Angeles Outfest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival; the [[Wisconsin Film Festival]]; and others.

The film, in its American [[television]] premiere, was introduced by then-actor [[Ronald Reagan]] as an episode of the [[CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' on 2 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmovie title|id=40656|title=The Red Balloon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, the film was popular in elementary classrooms throughout the United States and Canada. A four-minute clip is on the rotating list of programming on [[Classic Arts Showcase]].

===Reception===
Since its first release in 1956, the film has generally received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics. The film critic for ''[[the New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]], hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing that "Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E7DC1639E33BBC4A52DFB566838C649EDE|title=Screen: Documentary and Fantasy; 'Lost Continent,' 'Red Balloon' on Bill|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by [[Janus Films]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote, "More than any other children's film, ''The Red Balloon'' turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see ''The Red Balloon'' is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162166,00.html|title=The Red Balloon|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Brian Gibson wrote, "So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, ''The Red Balloon'' taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20130205160335/http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7536|title=What childhood films are these? :: Film :: VUE Weekly|date=2013-02-05|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: "[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. ''The Red Balloon'' may be the most seamless fusion of [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think [[Calvary]]–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the [[New Testament]]. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] or, at least, an old-fashioned [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_balloon/ ''The Red Balloon''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Accessed July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]].

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

==Renaissance==
===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

{{see also|English Renaissance theatre|Shakespearean tragedy|Revenge play|Domestic tragedy}}

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

The '''United Service Organizations Inc.''' ('''USO''') is a nonprofit organization that provides live entertainment, such as comedians and musicians, and other programs to members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and their families. Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], and later with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is [[US Congress|congressionally]]-chartered, it is not a government agency.

During [[World War II]], the USO became the [[GI (military)|GI]]'s "home away from home" and began a tradition of entertaining the troops that continues today. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, with nearly 1.5 million people having volunteered their services in some way. After it was disbanded in 1947, it was revived in 1950 for the [[Korean War]], after which it also provided peacetime services. During the [[Vietnam War]], USOs were sometimes located in combat zones.

The organization became particularly famous for its live performances, called camp shows, through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. [[Hollywood]] in general was eager to show its patriotism, and many famous celebrities joined the ranks of USO entertainers. They entertained in military bases at home and overseas, sometimes placing their own lives in danger, by traveling or performing under hazardous conditions.

The USO has over 200 locations around the world in 14 countries (including the U.S.) and 27 states. During a gala marking the USO's 75th anniversary in 2016, retired Army Gen. [[George W. Casey Jr.]], the current chairman of the USO Board of Governors, estimated that the USO has served more than 35 million Americans over its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/651462/from-world-war-ii-to-afghanistan-uso-marks-75th-anniversary "From World War II to Afghanistan: USO Marks 75th Anniversary"], Department of Defense, February 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pat-gallagher/uso-anniversary_b_9133132.html "Happy 75th Anniversary USO!"], ''Huffington Post'', February 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mission and goals===
[[File:Uso-show-mickey-rooney.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Mickey Rooney]], a World War II Bronze Star recipient, honoring the USO in 2000]]

The USO was founded in 1941 by [[Mary Shotwell Ingraham|Mary Ingraham]] in response to a request from President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the [[Salvation Army]], [[Young Men’s Christian Association]] (YMCA), [[Young Women’s Christian Association]] (YWCA), [[National Catholic Community Service]], [[National Travelers Aid Association]] and the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]]. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops. Roosevelt said he wanted "these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces." According to historian Emily Yellin, "The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military."&lt;ref name=Yellin&gt;Yellin, Emily. ''Our Mothers' War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Simon and Schuster (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national campaign chairman was [[Thomas Dewey]], who raised $16 million in the first year. The second chairman was future senator [[Prescott Bush]].&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; The USO was incorporated in New York on February 4,&lt;ref name="USO Historical Timeline"/&gt; with the first facility erected in DeRidder, Louisiana,1941.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II. "USO." ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History''. Oxford University Press (2000), [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O126-USO.html highbeam.com]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Bill. ''High Hat Sam: The Life and Times of Louisiana Governor Sam Houston Jones''. Springfield, Missouri : James E. Cornwell, 2014. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; More USO centers and clubs opened around the world as a “Home Away from Home” for [[GI (military)|GIs]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The USO club was a place to go for dances and social events, for movies and music, for a quiet place to talk or write a letter home, or for a free cup of coffee and an egg.{{clarify|reason=Just an egg? Really?  And what would a GI do with that?|date=May 2018}}

The USO also brought [[Hollywood]] celebrities and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] entertainers to perform for the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, "most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home." They did this, he noted, by "nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment."&lt;ref name=Cohan&gt;Cohan, Steven. ''The Road Movie Book'', Routledge (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Look'' magazine at the time, stated, "For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that is the goal of every fighting American far away from home." [[Maxene Andrews]] wrote, "The entertainment brought home to the boys. ''Their'' home." Actor [[George Raft]] stated at the beginning of the war, "Now it's going to be up to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home."&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

USO promotional literature stated its goals:

:"The story of USO camp shows belongs to the American people, for it was their contribution that made it possible. It is an important part in the life of your sons, your brothers, your husbands, and your sweethearts."&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

===World War II===
[[Image:Hope WWII 44.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Hope]] USO show, 1944]]

After being formed in 1941, in response to World War II, "centers were established quickly... in churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, castles, beach clubs, and log cabins."&lt;ref name=Clairday&gt;Clairday, Robynn. ''Postcards from World War II'', Square One Publishers (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Most centers offered recreational activities, such as holding dances and showing movies. And there were the well-known free coffee and doughnuts. Some USO centers provided a haven for spending a quiet moment alone or writing a letter home, while others offered spiritual guidance and made childcare available for military wives.

But the organization became mostly known for its live performances called ''Camp Shows'', through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. USO Camp Shows, Inc. began in October 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2uso.org/history.html WWII USO Preservation Association. ''History: USO Camp Shows, Inc.''], accessed 15 Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and by that fall and winter 186 military theaters existed in the United States. Overseas shows began in November 1941 with a tour of the Caribbean. Within five months 36 overseas units had been sent within the Americas, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and during 1942 1,000 performed as part of 70 units. Average performers were paid $100 a week; top stars were paid $10 a day because their wealth let them contribute more of their talents.{{r|jstor3204158}}

These overseas shows were produced by the American Theatre Wing, which also provided food and entertainment for the armed services in their Stage Door Canteens. Funds from the sale of film rights for a story about the New York Canteen went toward providing USO tours of shows for overseas troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/perry.html |title=Who is 'Tony'? |publisher= The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards®|website=TonyAwards.com |date=June 28, 1946 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, [[Edward G. Robinson]] was the first movie star to travel to Normandy to entertain the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J., [http://www.usc.edu/vh/tfm/autumn-2011/little-caesar-and-the-mccarthyist-mob.1.html "Little Caesar and the McCarthyist Mob"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114232149/http://www.usc.edu/vh/tfm/autumn-2011/little-caesar-and-the-mccarthyist-mob.1.html |date=November 14, 2016 }}, USC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2d/6d/77/2d6d77eeb0ab767294a28c6d8d05b836.jpg|title=Photo of Edward G. Robinson entertaining troops in Normandy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already been active back home selling war bonds, and donated $100,000 to the USO. During his show, he said, "This is the most privileged moment of my life, the opportunity to be here with you."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward G. ''All My Yesterdays'', Hawthorn Books (1973) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Camp Shows began in Normandy. 

Until fall 1944 overseas units contained five performers or fewer; ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', using local theaters in France and Italy, was the first to use an entire theater company, including scenery.{{r|jstor3204158}} At its high point in 1944, the USO had more than 3,000 clubs, and curtains were rising on USO shows 700 times a day. The USO's fundraising efforts were controversial. An [[MGM]] film, ''Mr. Gardenia Jones'', created to assist the USO in its fundraising campaign, was nearly withdrawn from theaters due to objections by the War Department, mainly because of scenes showing soldiers jumping with joy at the opportunity to shower in canteens and rest in overstuffed and comfortable USO chairs. The Army, noted the ''[[New York Times]]'', "feels this is not good for morale as it implies that there are no showers or other comforts for soldiers in military camps." The film starred [[Ronald Reagan]], then a captain in the [[United States Army Air Force|Army Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas. ''New York Times'', June 28, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundraising was also aided by non-USO entertainment groups. Soldier Shows, which troops – often experienced actors and musicians – organized and held their own performances, were common. The army formed a [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] unit that organized such shows and supervised the USO, and the experience from the Soldier Shows led to [[Irving Berlin]]'s Broadway show ''[[This Is the Army]]''. Performers and writers from throughout the army were recruited for the production; they remained soldiers and continued drills. Berlin, who had written and produced the similar ''[[Yip, Yip, Yaphank]]'' during World War I, took the entire 165-person cast on tour in Europe in 1942, raising nearly $10 million for the [[Army Emergency Relief]] Fund. The following year the show was made into a film by the same title, again starring Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;{{r|jstor3204158}} One of the highlights of the film was its introduction of Berlin's song, "[[God Bless America]]," considered one of the nation's most patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|09Gj7mJbPPc|"God Bless America" sung by Kate Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''This Is The Army'' stage production toured worldwide until it closed in October 1945 in [[Honolulu]].{{r|jstor3204158}}

War correspondent [[Quentin Reynolds]], wrote in an article for ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' in 1943, that "Entertainment, all phases of it – radio, pictures and live – should be treated as essential. You don't know what entertainment means to the guys who do the fighting until you've been up there with the men yourself. [...] You can quote me as saying that we should use entertainment as an essential industry so long as it's for the boys in service. Anybody who has been there would insist on it.  [...] Hell, you should have seen how happy the G.I.'s were when they heard the ballplayers were coming over. And [[John Steinbeck]], just back from a chore as war correspondent, [...] also applauded show business as part of the war effort and its importance as a morale builder."&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vwwEAAAAMBAJ "Quentin Reynolds Talks on Terrific Job Big and Little Showbiz is Doing Overseas"], ''Billboard'', October 30, 1943 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Irving Berlin aboard the USS Arkansas, 944.jpg|thumb|[[Irving Berlin]] singing aboard [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS ''Arkansas'']], 1944]]
According to historian Paul Holsinger, between 1941 and 1945, the USO did 293,738 performances in 208,178 separate visits. Estimates were that more than 161 million servicemen and women, in the U.S. and abroad, were entertained. The USO also did shows in military hospitals, eventually entertaining more than 3 million wounded soldiers and sailors in 192 different hospitals. There were 702 different USO troupes that toured the world, some spending up to six months per tour.&lt;ref name=Holsinger&gt;Holsinger, Paul. ''War and American Popular Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Publishing Group (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, a [[United States]] [[Liberty ship]] named the [[SS U.S.O.|SS ''U.S.O.'']] was launched. She was scrapped in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/116liberty_victory_ships/116facts1.htm Reading 1: Liberty Ships] ''[[National Park Service]] Cultural Resources.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-eight performers died in the course of their tours, from plane crashes, illness, or diseases contracted while on tour.&lt;ref name="jstor3204158"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matson | first1 = Lowell | last2 = | first2 = | year = 1954 | title = Theatre for the Armed Forces in World War II | journal = Educational Theatre Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | publisher = | doi = 10.2307/3204158 | jstor = 3204158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such instance in 1943, a plane carrying a USO troupe crashed outside [[Lisbon]], killing singer and actress [[Tamara Drasin]], and severely injuring Broadway singer [[Jane Froman]]. Froman returned to Europe on crutches in 1945 to again entertain the troops. She later married the co-pilot who saved her life in that crash, and her story was made into the 1952 film ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'', with Froman providing the actual singing voice.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Richard. [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/answers-about-world-war-ii-in-new-york/ "Answers About World War II in New York"] ''New York Times'', September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Al Jolson]], the first entertainer to go overseas in World War II, contracted [[malaria]], resulting in the loss of his lung, cutting short his tour.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Martin. [http://jolsonville.net/articles/world-war-ii-tours/ "Jolson Sings Again"], ''The Real Al Jolson'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

One author wrote that by the end of the war "the USO amounted to the biggest enterprise American show business has ever tackled. The audience was millions of American fighting men, the theatre's location: the world, the producer: USO camp shows"&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt; Performances continued after the end of the war in 1945. 60 new units went to Europe after [[V-E Day]], and 91 new units went to the Pacific after [[V-J Day]]. The USO dissolved in December 1947, after having spent $240 million in contributions on Camp Shows, canteens, and other services. Special Services productions grew in number as replacement.{{r|jstor3204158}}

In 1991, [[20th Century Fox]] produced the film, ''[[For the Boys]]'', which told the story of two USO performers, and starred [[Bette Midler]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]]. It covered a 50-year timespan, from the USO's inception in 1941 through [[Operation Desert Storm]], in 1991. Another movie was planned in 1950 but never made. Just 10 days after [[Al Jolson]] returned from entertaining troops in Korea, he agreed with [[RKO]] producers to star in a new movie, ''Stars and Stripes for Ever,'' about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. Unfortunately, he died a week later as a result of physical exhaustion from his tour.

====Women in the USO====
[[File:USO Girls Airventure 2013.jpg|thumb|left|USO women from the World War II era ([[Historical reenactment|reenactment]])]]

According to Emily Yellin, many of the key foot soldiers in the USO's mission were women who were "charged with providing friendly diversion for U.S. troops who were mostly men in their teens and twenties."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; USO centers throughout the world recruited female volunteers to serve doughnuts, dance, and just talk with the troops. USO historian Julia Carson writes that this "nostalgic hour," designed to cheer and comfort soldiers, involved "listening to music – American style" and "looking at pretty girls, like no other pretty girls in the world – American girls."&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Julia. ''Home Away From Home: The Story of the USO'', Harper &amp; Brothers (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American women scrambled to rally the community around the soldiers and create programs for them. By 1946, hostesses had served more than two thousand soldiers a day while also providing facilities for the wounded and convalescent who were on leave. They went to black businesses and fraternal organizations in order to find sponsorship for their USO group, and later expanded to fulfill the needs of soldiers during the Korean War. Moreover, they worked to merge black and white USOs into one desegregated unit. As black historian Megan Shockley noted, "Their work for the desegregation of USOs had begun during World War II, and it finally paid off."&lt;ref&gt;Shockley, Megan Taylor. ''We, Too, are Americans: African American Women in Detroit and Richmond, 1940–55'', Univ. of Illinois Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also key entertainers who performed at shows. Stars such as [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Rita Hayworth]] had traveled over a million miles. Yellin notes that on one tour, Hayworth visited six camps, gave thousands of autographs, and "came back from Texas with a full-fledged nervous breakdown from over-enthusiasm!"&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Opera singer [[Lily Pons]], after she had performed a "serious" opera song to troops in [[Burma]], "an applause erupted that stunned even the most seasoned performers." She later wrote in a letter, "Every woman back home wears a halo now, and those who represent her had better keep theirs on, too."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;

Author Joeie Dee pointed out that "for women entertainers, traveling with the USO made it possible to be patriots and adventurers as well as professionals." She adds, however, that the G.I.s in the USO audiences "tended to see these women in a different light – as reminders of and even substitutes for their girls back home, as a reward for fighting the war, as embodiments of what they were fighting for."&lt;ref name=Dee&gt;Dee, Joeie. ''Hi GI'', Xulon Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Skvarna remembers 1943, when he met [[Donna Reed]] at a USO canteen and asked her to dance. "I had never danced with a celebrity before, so I felt delighted, privileged even, to meet her.... But I really felt she was like a girl from back home." Jay Fultz, author of a biography of Reed, states that soldiers "often wrote to her as if to a sister or the girl next door, confiding moments of homesickness, loneliness, privation and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/arts/25donna.html?pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th "Dear Donna: A Pinup So Swell She Kept G.I. Mail"], ''New York Times'', May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women entertainers====
[[Image:USO Vietnam70.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard, 1st show in Vietnam, 1970]]

One female entertainer wrote about conditions while performing:
{{quote|We've played to audiences, many of them ankle deep in mud, huddled under the ponchos in the pouring rain (it breaks your heart the first two or three times to see men so hungry for entertainment.) We've played on uncovered stages, when we, as well as the audience, got rain-soaked. We've played with huge tropical bugs flying in our hair and faces; we've played to audiences of thousands of men, audiences spreading from our very feet to far up a hillside and many sitting in the trees. ... We've played to audiences in small units of 500 or so, and much oftener to audiences of 8 to 10,000. Every night we play a different place.&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;}}

Singer-actress-dancer [[Ann Miller]] described performing for badly wounded soldiers. She did forty-eight shows for "broken soldiers," who were mostly lying on stretchers in the lobbies of hotels, watching as she entertained them. Yellin writes, "During her last show she collapsed and had to be taken home on an Army airplane."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Afterwards, Miller described the experience:

{{quote|We went from ward to ward to ward, singing and dancing and trying to boost the morale of these men. It was just hell. ... I just fell apart and I think the shock of seeing those men with their arms and legs blown off – it was just frightening. But when you do it, you do it. You try to help them, try to sing and dance. You try to keep their spirits up. It's heartbreaking.&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;}}

In November and December 1968 Jennie and [http://sedonasevenarcheslive.com/terrie-s-uso---veteran-connection.html Terrie Frankel] (the [[Doublemint Twins]]) performed in Vietnam with the USO – Hollywood Overseas Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/78282|title=Terrie Maxine Frankel Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were shepherded around Vietnam by escort officers (USO Performers were given GS15 ratings{{clarify|reason=What does that mean? And what does a rating have to do with safety?|date=May 2018}}, equivalent to Colonel, to help maintain their safety) to entertain troops in the field, where larger USO shows could not perform.

===Korean War===
[[File:Jolson-Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Al Jolson]], the first star to perform in Korea, September 17, 1950]]
In 1947, the USO was disbanded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/history.aspx/|title=The Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due partly to lack of funds.&lt;ref name=Freedland&gt;Freedland, Michael. ''The Story of Al Jolson '' (1972), pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, when the United States entered the Korean War, Secretary of Defense [[George Marshall]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Francis P. Matthews]] requested that the USO be reactivated "to provide support for the men and women of the armed forces with help of the American people." According to war historian Paul Edwards, Between 1952 and 1953, not a day went by without the USO providing services somewhere in Korea. At home or overseas, in 1952 it was serving 3.5 million in the armed forces using much the same methods of operation as it did in World War II.

Many stars, both well-known and new, came to perform, including [[Bob Hope]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Donald O'Connor]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Rory Calhoun]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Al Jolson#World War II and Korean War tours|Al Jolson]] and many others. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Military|Hispanic-American soldiers]] were entertained by artists such as [[Dámaso Pérez Prado|Pérez Prado]]'s Show featuring [[Evita Muñoz]] as his invited [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] dancer. Jolson was the first to volunteer, but due to lack of USO funds traveled to Korea at his own expense&lt;ref&gt;Akst, Harry [http://jolsonville.net/articles/korean-war-tours/first-stop-tokyo/ "The Jolson Nobody Knew"], ''Cosmopolitan'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; (he was also the first to entertain troops during World War II).&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, S.J. [http://jolsonville.net/articles/world-war-ii-tours/army-minstrel-1942/ "Army Minstrel"], ''New York Times'', September 27, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marilyn Monroe - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|[[Marilyn Monroe]] performing in Korea, 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marilyn Monroe Ends Korea Swing|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/marilyn-monroe-ends-korea-swing-1.6409|accessdate=6 May 2018|work=Stars and Stripes|publisher=Stripes.com|date=February 23, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Veterans have recalled many of the USOs events, sometimes in vivid detail:

{{quote|On that cold, overcast day, there were more than five thousand troops in the audience. They sat on the ground or up on the hillside. When everyone was settled, [[Danny Kaye]] opened the show by going to the microphone, looking at his large audience, and shouting, "Who's holding back the enemy?" The GIs roared with laughter. We were thrilled to have Kaye and his entertainers in our area. We especially liked the young women in the show. Danny was okay, with his stories and jokes, but after all, we knew what American men looked like.&lt;ref name=Granfield&gt;Granfield, Linda. ''I Remember Korea: Veterans Tell Their Stories of the Korean War, 1950–53'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}}}

Author Linda Granfield in describing the show, writes, "For two hours, the men could forget they were soldiers at war. After the show, they returned to the fighting in the hills. Some in that audience never made it back."&lt;ref name=Granfield/&gt; By the end of the war, over 113,000 American USO volunteers were working at 294 centers at home and abroad.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Paul M. ''The Korean War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; And 126 units had given 5,422 performances to servicemen in Korea and the wounded in Japan.

===Vietnam War===
The USO was in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] before the first combat troops arrived, with the first USO club opened in Saigon in April 1963. The 23 centers in Vietnam and [[Thailand]] served as many as a million service members a month, and the USO presented more than 5,000 performances during the [[Vietnam War]] featuring stars such as [[John Wayne]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Raymond Burr]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Joey Heatherton]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Anita Bryant]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Lola Falana]], [[George Peppard]] and [[Bob Hope]]. [[Philip Ahn]], the first actor of Korean descent to become a Hollywood star, became the first Asian American USO performer to entertain troops in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Seung. ''Hollywood Asian'', Temple Univ. Press (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thousands of service personnel listen to Miss Ann-Margret sing one of her numbers during her show in Danang, Vietnam. - NARA - 532506.tiff|thumb|px240|[[Ann-Margret]] performing in Vietnam, 1966]]
[[File:USO Show Vietnam 1968 Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, 3 Soldiers, Jennie Frankel.jpg|thumb|USO Show Vietnam, 1968: Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, Jennie Frankel, and three Soldiers]]

In addition, the USO operated centers at major U.S. airports to provide a lounge and place to sleep for American servicemen between their flights. Vietnam historian James Westheider noted that the USO "tried to bring a little America to Vietnam." Volunteer American civilians, who did 18-month tours, staffed the clubs. According to Westheider, "The young women wore miniskirts – no slacks were allowed." Each club had a snack bar, gift shops, a barbershop, photo developing, overseas phone lines, and hot showers.&lt;ref name=Westheider&gt;Westheider, James E. ''The Vietnam War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When providing entertainment, the USO did its best to attract known stars from back home to help relieve the stresses of war. Senator [[John Kerry]] recalled how important this kind of diversion would become. He remembered a "Bob Hope Follies" USO show, which included actress [[Ann-Margret]], Miss America, football star [[Rosey Grier]], and others. According to Kerry biographer Douglas Brinkley, "When the Swift finally made it back to the My Tho River, the crew confronted the heartbreaking sight of a huge Navy landing craft ferrying the troops back. The USO show was over." Kerry later wrote, "The visions of Ann Margret and Miss America and all the other titillating personalities who would have made us feel so at home hung around us for a while until we saw three Chinook helicopters take off from the field and presumed that our dreams had gone with them."&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Douglas. ''Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War'' HarperCollins (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

But for GIs who saw the show, it was worth it: "We turned to watch Ann perform, and for about two minutes of American beauty, the war was forgotten. Everyone fully understood just what was really worth fighting for. . . . The show was fantastic, but the escape the Bob Hope tour provided us in expectation for days before, and after, helped us keep in touch with what we were there for – God, Country, apple pie ... and Ann-Margret!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-bob-hope-1966-2.asp War-Stories.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The visits by the stars meant a lot to the men and women in Vietnam. "It was not just the entertainment; it meant that they were not forgotten that far away from home," writes Westheider.&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt; He adds that the tours made a "deep impression" on the stars as well. Singer and actress [[Connie Stevens]] remembered her 1969 tour with Bob Hope, when she decided to go despite the fact she had two children both under the age of two. Today, she claims that "veterans were still stopping her and thanking her for visiting Vietnam over 30 years later."&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt;

Similarly, [[Ann-Margret]] during a book signing was approached by a veteran who asked her to sign a photo he took of her performing in Vietnam. Although the book's publishing representative for the signing event would not allow her to sign anything other than her book, the veteran's wife recalls:

{{quote|She took one look at the photo, tears welled up in her eyes, and she said, 'This is one of my gentlemen from Viet Nam and I most certainly will sign his photo. I know what these men did for their country and I always have time for 'my gentlemen.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://jdeaustcp.blogspot.com/2013/04/ann-margret-real-woman-of-year.html "Ann-Margret ... The Real WOMAN OF THE YEAR"], jdeaustocp blog, April 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November–December 1968 the Sig Sakowitz troop from Chicago performed over 36 shows in South Vietnam with the USO in: Pleiku, Dalat, Danang, Cam Ran Bay, Phu Bai, Phu Loy, Hue, Natrang, Tan Son Nhut Airbase, Saigon and places in the boonies known only to military intelligence and the lonely soldiers yearning for a taste of home. The troop consisted of Doublemint Twins Terrie and Jennie Frankel, Gaslight Club singer Sara Sue, Comedian Tony Diamond and personality Sig Sakowitz. Shows were also performed with comedian Joey Bishop of the Rat Pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.78282/ |title=Terrie Maxine Frankel: Digital Collection: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Peppard, successful star of stage, TV and motion pictures, arrived in Vietnam for a USO HANDSHAKE TOUR in 1970 to visit the military in the hospitals and out in the “boonies.” ...He showed a keen interest in the men’s mission while they were hungry for news of life back in the “World.” ... Polaroid pictures were taken by Mr. Peppard’s escort officer, autographed, and given to the men.&lt;ref&gt;Credit USO Photo/Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a bloody [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]] was raging in Lebanon. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Multinational Force]] of [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]]s composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name="CCN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historiccamdencounty.com/ccnews17.shtml |title=Launch your own missile from Battleship New Jersey: Warship Museum Prepares New 'Interactive' Combat Control Center |accessdate=May 21, 2007 |last=Levins |first=Hoag |publisher=HistoricCamdenCounty.com|date=October 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
American troops have been deployed in [[Italy]] since the end of [[World War II]]. In 1988, a car bomb [[1988 Naples bombing|targeted the USO club in Naples]], which killed five people including a U.S. Navy officer.

===Gulf War===
[[Image:Bob Hope and Ann Jillian.jpg|thumb|Bob Hope and [[Ann Jillian]] perform at the USO Christmas Tour during [[Operation Desert Shield]]]]
To support troops participating in [[Operation Desert Shield]], USO centers opened in [[Saudi Arabia]].

===Afghanistan and Iraq===
To support troops participating in Operations [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Enduring Freedom]] and [[Iraqi Freedom]], USO centers opened in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Qatar]]. USO centers number more than 160 around the world. In those years, the USO opened centers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Afghanistan. The USO provides a variety of programs and services, including orientation programs, family events, free Internet and e-mail access, free drinks and snacks, free phone calls home and recreation services. One of the newer programs, called "USO in a Box," delivers program materials ranging from DVD players and videos to musical instruments to remote forward operating bases in Afghanistan.

U.S. military personnel and their families visit USO centers more than eight million times each year.

In 1997, the U.S. Congress honored [[Bob Hope]] by declaring him the "first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2014/08/bob-hope-first-and-only-honorary-veteran-of-the-armed-forces/ "Bob Hope: First and only honorary veteran of the Armed Forces"], ''Army Live'', August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faith&gt;Faith, William. ''Bob Hope: A Life in Comedy'', Da Capo Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hope biographer William Faith, his reputation has become ingrained in the "American consciousness" because he had flown millions of miles to entertain G.I.s during both wartime and peace. His contribution to the USO began in 1941 and ended with [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1991, spending 48 [[Christmas]]es overseas with American service personnel.&lt;ref name="MaroldaSchneller"/&gt; He was always treated as "an asset to the U.S. Government with his willingness to entertain whenever they needed him."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; After WWII was declared over, the USO had sent out an "impassioned bulletin" asking entertainers not to abandon the GIs now that the war was over. Hope was among the first to say yes. The [[Military Order of the Purple Heart]] notes that "his contributions to the USO are well known: they are legend."&lt;ref&gt;Military Order of the Purple Heart, ''Legacy of the Purple Heart'', 4th Ed., Turner Publishing Co. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his non-stop entertainment to both the civilian population and the military, he received numerous other honors over the years: a [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Air Force plane]] was named ''The Spirit of Bob Hope''; a naval vessel was named the ''[[USNS Bob Hope]]''; and streets, schools, hospitals, and a golf tournament were also named in his honor. A Senate resolution declared him "a part of American folklore." The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' called him the most honored entertainer ever.  And during his 1993 televised birthday celebration, when he turned 90, [[General Colin Powell]] saluted Hope "for his tireless USO trouping", which was followed by onstage tributes from all branches of the armed forces. [[General William Westmoreland]] spoke about his loyalty to the GI throughout the gritty Vietnam years. And bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], who was with him during many of his tours, mentioned that his band "had seen more of Hope's ass in the last forty years than any of Hope's immediate family."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds wrote in 1943, "He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows... One of the generals said Hope was a first rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope's value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there."&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

During the Vietnam War years he gave a number of high-rating television specials and sensed that the media had given him a broad endorsement for continuing on his GI mercy missions. Soon after his Christmas show in Saigon in 1967, he learned that the [[Vietcong]] had planned a terrorist attack at his hotel against him and his entire troupe, missing him by ten minutes. He was later "mystified," writes Faith, "and ... increasingly intolerant of the pockets of dissent. [[Draft-card burning]]s on college campuses angered him..." "Can you imagine," Hope wrote in a magazine article, "... that people in America are burning their draft cards to show their opposition and that some of them are actually rooting for your defeat?"&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; In the spring of 1973, Hope began writing his fifth book, ''The Last Christmas Show'', which was dedicated to "the men and women of the armed forces and to those who also served by worrying and waiting." He signed over his royalties to the USO.

His final Christmas show was during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1990. The show was not easy, notes Faith. "There were so many restrictions. Hope's jokes were monitored by the State Department to avoid offending the Saudis... and the media was restricted from covering the shows... Because in Saudi Arabia national custom prescribes that women must be veiled in public, [[Ann Jillian]], [[Marie Osmond]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]] were left off Hope's Christmas Eve show."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

In 2009, [[Stephen Colbert]] performing his last episode of weeklong taping in Iraq for his ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' show, carried a golf club on stage and dedicated it to [[Bob Hope]]'s service for the USO.

==Financial matters==
The USO has a paid staff of approximately 300. Additionally, more than 44,000 USO volunteers provide an estimated 371,417 hours of service annually. As reported by the USO, the unpaid volunteer to paid employee ratio overseas is 20 to 1. Within the United States, the number is "significantly higher."

The following information is based on USO's audited financial statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/financial-statements.aspx|title=USO.org|publisher=|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930162941/http://www.uso.org/financial-statements.aspx|archive-date=September 30, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the year ended December 31, 2011:

==Cultural references==
[[Billy Joel]]'s song, "[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]" (1982), includes the lines: "Well our fathers fought the Second World War/
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore/
Met our mothers in the USO/
Asked them to dance/
Danced with them slow."

From the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'': "[[Viet Cong|Charlie]] didn't get much USO. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast. His idea of great R&amp;R was cold rice and a little rat meat. He had only two ways home: death, or victory."

The music video for the My Chemical Romance song, "The Ghost of You" is set at a USO dance. 

The climax of the 1999 ''South Park'' movie, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut|South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut]]'', is set at a USO show.

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In comedy, a '''visual gag''' or '''sight gag''' is anything which conveys its [[humour]] visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence.&lt;ref name=LifeSightGagRevival&gt;{{cite news|title=Sight Gag Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22sight+gag%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6pr_TuyKPMzisQL-voWtAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sight%20gag%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=3 February 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on.&lt;ref name=Carroll146&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Noel|title=Theorizing the moving image|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46049-1|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpPOPQyOzb8C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22sight+gag%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6pr_TuyKPMzisQL-voWtAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sight%20gag%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies.

==Types==
The most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events.&lt;ref name=Carroll148&gt;Carroll, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; This type is used in the 1935 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]''. Lead actor [[Robert Donat]] was kidnapping actress [[Madeleine Carroll]] and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways.&lt;ref name=Carroll148 /&gt;

Another visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before.&lt;ref name=Carroll152&gt;Carroll, page 152&lt;/ref&gt; Switched movement may be the gag, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] in ''[[The Pawnshop]]''. Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor.&lt;ref name=Carroll152 /&gt; 

Noel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below.

Mutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands

Mimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a [[doughnut]] is a [[barbell]] or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the [[Lumière brothers]]' 1895 short, ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]'' ("The Waterer Watered"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaines|first=Jane M.|title=Early Cinema's Heyday of Copying|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~bookworm/gaines-cinema.pdf|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=31 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111220145/http://www.indiana.edu/~bookworm/gaines-cinema.pdf|archive-date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early pioneer in visual gags was [[Georges Méliès]]. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt;

[[Vaudeville]] actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop.&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks /&gt;  Visual gags were continued into [[silent film]]s and are considered a hallmark of the genre.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing.&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks /&gt;  Comedians including [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and the [[Marx Brothers]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Dana|title=Holiday Books: Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Stevens-t.html?scp=51&amp;sq=%22sight+gag%22+-%22Laugh+Lines+Blog%22&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' cites the fourth ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' episode, "Goodnight, Sweet Skipper", as a classic American sight gag.&lt;ref name=NYTimesNewSitcoms&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=Naked Truth: New Sitcoms Are Reruns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/arts/television/new-girls-2-broke-girls-last-man-standing-new-season-for-old-jokes.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq&amp;st=nyt&amp;%2334;Laugh%20Lines%20Blog&amp;%2334;sight%20gag&amp;%2334;&amp;%2334;%20-&amp;scp=3|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a [[radio]]. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a [[transmitter]] in [[World War II]] when he was [[sleepwalking]]. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled.&lt;ref name=NYTimesNewSitcoms /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1053">'''Voice casting''' is a vital pre-production process for selecting the [[voice talent]] for [[radio]] and [[television]] [[commercials]], [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[corporate]] [[narrations]], [[audiobook]]s and [[online tutorials]]. It involves a series of [[auditions]] in front of a [[Film producer|producer]]/[[Film director|director]].

==Online voice casting==
There has been a shift to online voice over casting in recent years. With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdrewvo.com/html/home_voiceover_studio.html|title=Home Voiceover Studios-Equipping Yours-Peter Drew Voiceovers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents. Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.

A '''workshop production''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] performance, in which a play or musical is staged in a modest form which does not include some aspects of a full production. For example, costumes, sets and musical accompaniment may be excluded, or may be included in a simpler form.

One common purpose of a workshop production is to provide a [[preview (theatre)|preview]] staging of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official [[premiere]]. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model.

Some fictional works, including the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' and the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'', depict the audition and workshop processes of developmental theatrical productions.
