The '''Association for Business Communication''' ('''ABC''') is  a  [[learned society]] for the field of [[business communication]]. Its mission statement states: "The Association for Business Communication (ABC) is an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice". The organization is [[interdisciplinary]], with members belonging to academic fields such as [[management]], [[marketing]], [[English language|English]], foreign languages, [[public speaking|speech]], [[communication]], [[linguistics]], and [[information systems]]. Additionally the organization brings together university academicians, business practitioners, and business consultants.

==Organizational structure==
ABC is an international organization, divided into nine regional divisions (Europe, Asia and Pacific Rim, Caribbean and Central America, and five North American regions: Canada plus Eastern, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western United States), each with its own separate academic conferences. Each year, the association holds an International Conference in October or November. Midyear, regional conferences are held—one in the European region and one or two of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years or more frequently.

A [[board of directors]] and an [[executive committee]] lead the ABC. The board of directors is directly elected with a vice president elected from each of 9 regions and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. The executive committee consists of a permanent position of executive director and four officers of the association. The members of the executive committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as second vice president in the first year, then first vice president the next, president the next, and past president the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the second vice president position from among candidates on the board of directors.

The current executive director of the ABC is [[James M. Dubinsky]] ([[Virginia Tech]]). He took office in 2011.

For 2018-2019 the executive committee consists of President Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder ([[North Carolina A &amp; T University]]), First Vice President Marcel Robles ([[Eastern Kentucky University]]), Second Vice President Geert Jacobs ([[Ghent University]]), and immediate Past President Deborah Roebuck ([[Kennesaw State University]]).

== Publications ==
Two [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]s, ''[[International Journal of Business Communication]]'' and the ''[[Business and Professional Communication Quarterly]]'' are published by [[SAGE Publications]] on behalf of ABC.

== Standing committees, ad hoc committees and interest groups ==

The ABC has standing committees, as follow:

    Academic Environment
    Business Practices
    Conference Procedures
    C.R. Anderson Research Fund
    Diversity and Inclusion
    Employment Opportunities
    Graduate Studies
    International Issues
    Marketing and Membership
    Modern Language Association Liaison (MLA)
    Nominating
    Publications Board
    Research
    Student Competition
    Teaching
    Technology
    Undergraduate Studies

The ABC has ad hoc committees for interests that have not yet warranted a standing committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the standing committees began as ad hoc committees. In 2017, the ABC had these ad hoc committees:

    Finance Committee
    National Communication Association Liaison
    Proceedings Editorial Review Board
    Vision/Mission Review Committee

Additionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. A Special Interest Group may be convened by the First Vice President or by members’ current interest groups. In 2017, the ABC had the following Special Interest Groups:

    Business Writing and Speaking Centers
    Community College
    Consulting
    Intercultural Communication
    MBA
    Rhetoric
    Teaching with Technology


==History==

ABC was founded in 1936, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], was then named the “Association of College Teachers of Business Writers.” The next year, 1937, that name changed to the “American Business Writing Association.”

By the 1960s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In 1967, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the “American Business Communication Association” to reflect this change.

By the late 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more members from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term “American” became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current “Association for Business Communication.”

In 1990, ABC moved its headquarters from [[Illinois]] first to the [[University of North Texas]] (1990–1994) and then to [[Baruch College]] [[CUNY]] in [[New York City]] (from 1994–2007) and then to [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] (from 2007-2011). Presently, the ABC is headquartered at [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].

'''Aurora Fashions''' was a [[holding company]] of several retail fashion brands, formed in 2009 to purchase a number of businesses from the collapsed [[Mosaic Fashions]]. The company operates over 1250 stores in 38 countries, including franchises, under the Oasis, Warehouse and [[Coast (clothing)|Coast]] brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Tiffany|title=Aurora Fashions to be broken up in radical restructure|url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/fashion/aurora-fashions-to-be-broken-up-in-radical-restructure/5047015.article|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=Retail Week|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the company announced plans to spin-off [[Karen Millen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/fashion/aurora-fashions-to-spin-off-karen-millen/5023002.article |title=Aurora Fashions to spin off Karen Millen |last=Rushton |first=Katherine |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=Retail Week |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruddick|first1=Graham|title=Aurora moves closer to break-up as Karen Millen boss departs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11319553/Aurora-moves-closer-to-break-up-as-Karen-Millen-boss-departs.html|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Millen was separated from the group to be owned by Aurora's parent [[Kaupthing Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Charlie|title=Mixed trading conditions for Aurora Fashions|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/mixed-trading-conditions-for-aurora-fashions-1.2497110|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=The Irish Times|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurora announced further plans in March 2013 for a wider restructuring. As part of this, Coast was also separated from the rest of the group, under the ownership of Kaupthing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Sarah|title=Kate Bostock to head up Coast|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/20/kate-bostock-coast|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was planned that Oasis and Warehouse would be merged under a new single parent company, Fresh Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Gemma|title=Aurora Fashions to restructure business|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/articles/30324-aurora-fashions-to-restructure-business|accessdate=31 December 2014|work=Retail Gazette|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Losses widen at fashion giant|url=http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/national/133023-losses-widen-fashion-giant/|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=Insider Media|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two brands were eventually demerged as the Oasis and Warehouse Group, led by Liz Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neville|first1=Simon|title=Oasis: Fashion brand turns profit for first time in three years as it goes upmarket|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/oasis-fashion-brand-turns-profit-for-first-time-in-three-years-as-it-goes-upmarket-a6750846.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Philip|title=Oasis carries Warehouse as group turns profit|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2015/11/oasis-carries-warehouse-as-group-turns-profit|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=Retail Gazette|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stock market trading, a '''Bull trap''' is an inaccurate signal that shows a [[Bear market|decreasing trend]] in a [[stock]] or [[Index (economics)|index]] has reversed and is now heading [[Bull market|upwards]], when in fact, the security will continue to decline.

It is seen as a trap because the [[bullish]] investor purchases the stock, thinking it will increase in value, but is trapped with a poor performing stock whose value is still falling.

'''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, key performance indicators, business / operational exceptions and business risks, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s.

The term was originally coined by analysts at [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/105500/105562/105562.pdf Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a [[business process]] that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management.

==Goals and benefits==
The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed [[business decision]]s, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.

==Key features==
One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing the [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems.

Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably.

Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the [[issue tracking system]]. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated [[problem solving]], where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes.

==Deployment effort==
In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions.

BAM is now considered{{who|date=January 2016}} a critical component of [[Operational Intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information.

==Processing events==
All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on [[complex event processing]] (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers.

==Examples==
A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.

Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

A '''business plan''' is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, and the time frame that these goals need to be achieved. It also describes the nature of the business, includes background information on the organization, the organization's financial projections, and the strategies it intends to implement to achieve stated targets. In its entirety, this document serves as a road map that provides direction to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/business-plan|title=Business Plan Definition - Entrepreneur Small Business Encyclopedia|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written business plans are often required to obtain a bank loan or other kind of financing.

==Audience==

Business plans may be internally or externally focused.  Externally-focused plans draft goals that are important to outside stakeholders, particularly financial stakeholders.  These plans typically have detailed information about the organization or the team making effort to reach its goals.  With for-profit entities, external stakeholders include investors and customers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/planning/sbabusplan.html Small Business Notes] business plan outline for small    business start-up&lt;/ref&gt;  for non-profits, external stakeholders refer to donors and clients,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152438/http://ase.tufts.edu/yet/pdf/Non-Profit%20Incorporating%20%20The%20Business%20Plan.pdf Tufts University] non-profit business plan&lt;/ref&gt;  for government agencies, external stakeholders are the tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], various economic agencies of the [[United Nations]], and [[Multilateral development bank|development banks]].

Internally-focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals.   They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization.  An internally-focused business plan is often developed in conjunction with a [[balanced scorecard]] or a list of critical success factors.  This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures.  

Business plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called [[Strategic planning|strategic plans]].

Operational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doa.louisiana.gov/opb/faf/OPFormatWord_FY01MWLayout.pdf State of Louisiana, USA]  government agency operational plan&lt;/ref&gt; Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project.  They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base Tasmanian government project management knowledge base] government project plan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622211235/http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Business plans are [[decision-making tools]].  The content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization's mission.  Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization's ability to repay the loan.  [[Venture capitalists]] are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation.  A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will lead to a high exit valuation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Preparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: [[finance]], human resource management, [[intellectual property]] management, [[supply chain management]], operations management, and [[marketing]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Business Plan Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116051622/http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html |date=2008-01-16 }} The business school advises students that "To create a robust business plan, teams must take a comprehensive view of the enterprise and incorporate management-practice knowledge from every first-semester course." It is increasingly common for business schools to use business plan projects to provide an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge learned through their courses.&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.&lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993"&gt;Eric S. Siegel, Brian R. Ford, Jay M. Bornstein (1993), ''''The Ernst &amp; Young Business Plan Guide'''' (New York: John Wiley and Sons) {{ISBN|0-471-57826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... a good business plan can help to make a good business credible, understandable, and attractive to someone who is unfamiliar with the business. Writing a good business plan can’t guarantee success, but it can go a long way toward reducing the odds of failure." &lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993" /&gt;

== Presentation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is common for businesses, especially start-ups, to have three or four formats for the same business plan.

An "[[elevator pitch]]" is a short summary of the plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners. It is called an elevator pitch as it is supposed to be content that can be explained to someone else quickly in an elevator. The elevator pitch should be between 30 and 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="inc magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/mastering-business-elevator-pitch.html|title=How to Master Your Elevator Pitch|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sales presentation|pitch deck]] is a slide show and oral presentation that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation.  The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits, a demonstration of the product may be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/pitchdeck/|title=How To Create An Early-Stage Pitch Deck For Investors|first=|last=Contributor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A written presentation for external stakeholders is a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.

An internal operational plan is a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders.  Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders and others.

== Revising the business plan ==

=== Cost overruns and revenue shortfalls ===

Cost and [[revenue]] estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the [[dot-com bubble]] 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. [[Reference class forecasting]] has been developed to reduce the risks of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls and thus generate more accurate business plans.

==Legal and liability issues==

=== Disclosure requirements ===
An externally targeted business plan should list all legal concerns and financial liabilities that might negatively affect investors.  Depending on the amount of funds being raised and the audience to whom the plan is presented, failure to do this may have severe legal consequences.

=== Limitations on content and audience ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Non disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs) with third parties, [[non-compete agreement]]s, conflicts of interest, privacy concerns, and the protection of one's [[trade secrets]] may severely limit the audience to which one might show the business plan.  Alternatively, they may require each party receiving the business plan to sign a contract accepting special clauses and conditions.

This situation is complicated by the fact that many venture capitalists will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan, lest it put them in the untenable position of looking at two independently developed look-alike business plans, both claiming originality.  In such situations one may need to develop two versions of the business plan: a stripped down plan that can be used to develop a relationship and a detail plan that is only shown when investors have sufficient interest and trust to sign an NDA.

==Open business plans==
Traditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in audience.
The business plan itself is generally regarded as secret.

An open business plan is a business plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically
web published and made available to all.

In the free software and open source business model, trade secrets, [[copyright]] and patents can no longer
be used as effective locking mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models.

== Uses ==
*[[Education]]
**Business plans are used in some primary and secondary programs to teach economic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Economic Spa|url=http://www.economicspa.org/products.asp?cat=15&amp;hierarchy=02|title= Pennsylvania Business Plan Competition}} competition intended to teach economic principles to K-12 students&lt;/ref&gt;  
:*[[Wikiversity]] has a [[v:Lunar Boom Town|Lunar Boom Town]] project where students of all ages can collaborate with designing and revising business models and practice evaluating them to learn practical business planning techniques and methodology

*Fundraising
Fundraising is the primary purpose for many business plans, since they are related to the inherent probable success/failure of the company risk.
:*[[Angel investor]]s
:*[[Business loan]]s
:*[[Grant (money)|Grants]]
:*[[Startup company]] funding
:*[[Venture capital]]

*Internal use
:*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO) is a process of agreeing upon objectives (as can be detailed within business plans) within an organization so that management and employees agree to the objectives and understand what they are in the organization.
:*[[Strategic planning]] is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy, including its capital and people. Business plans can help decision makers see how specific projects relate to the organization's strategic plan.
:*[[Total quality management]] (TQM) is a business management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. TQM has been widely used in manufacturing, education, call centers, government, and service industries, as well as NASA space and science programs.

==Not for profit businesses==
The business goals may be defined both for [[non-profit]]  or for-profit organizations.  For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals, such as profit or creation of wealth.  Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the "organizational mission" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively—although non-profits may also focus on optimizing revenue.

The primary difference between profit and non-profit organizations is that "for-profit" organizations look to maximize wealth versus non-profit organizations, which look to provide a greater good to society. In non-profit organizations, creative tensions may develop in the effort to balance mission with "margin" (or revenue).

==Satires==
The business plan is the subject of many satires.  Satires are used both to express cynicism about business plans and as an educational tool to improve the quality of business plans.  For example,
* In his presentation, ''Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech'', Dr. Roger Bernier, uses ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strips to remind people what ''not'' to do when researching and writing a business plan for a biotech start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |title=Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech |author=Bernier, Roger Laurent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201111/http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |archivedate=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Selena Maranjian's "Fool on the Hill" article in ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', "'South Park's' Investing Lesson" (November 8, 2001), references the "Underpants Gnomes" to illustrate the fallacy of focusing on goals without a clear implementation strategy. That "[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]" episode satirizes the business plans of the [[Dot.com bubble|Dot-com era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Park's' Investing Lesson|author=Maranjian, Selena|date=November 8, 2001|work=The Motley Fool|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm|access-date=2007-10-16|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ArVrcEB?url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm#|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapter 26 of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel [[Cryptonomicon]] begins with the business plan of a fictional high tech company, satirizing both the writing style and the physical form of slickly produced business publications like business plans and [[annual report]]s.

'''Business process re-engineering''' ('''BPR''') is a [[Strategic management|business management strategy]], originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of [[workflow]]s and [[business process]]es within an organization. BPR aimed to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s.&lt;ref name="GAO97"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/76302.pdf Business Process Re-engineering Assessment Guide], United States General Accounting Office, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Re-engineering emphasized a [[Holism|holistic]] focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, [[business transformation]], or business process change management.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Reengineering guidence.jpg|thumb|240px|Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology.]]
Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's [[Mission statement|mission]] and reduce [[cost]]s. Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use modern technology to enhance data dissemination and decision-making processes. Then, they alter functional organizations to form functional teams.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and [[requirements|customer needs]]. Basic questions are asked, such as "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Within the [[Conceptual framework|framework]] of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create [[Product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|service]]s that meet the needs of particular [[customer]]s or [[Market (economics)|market]]s. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's [[business process]]es are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one is responsible for the overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

== History ==
Business process reengineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help [[organization]]s fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve [[customer service]], cut [[operational costs]], and become world-class [[competitor]]s. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated [[information system]]s and [[Computer network|networks]]. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.&lt;ref name="GAO97"/&gt;

=== Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990 ===
In 1990, [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]], a former professor of computer science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), published the article "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate" in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to obliterate forms of work that do not add value, rather than using technology for automating it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer, [http://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate "Reengineering Work: Don’t Automate, Obliterate"], ''Hardvard Business Review'', July, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the wrong issues, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating existing processes rather than using it as an enabler for making non-value adding work obsolete.

Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their inability to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Even well-established management thinkers, such as [[Peter Drucker]]  and [[Tom Peters]], were accepting and advocating BPR as a new tool for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world.&lt;ref name="Forbes93"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/08/23/78237/index.htm Forbes: Reengineering, The Hot New Managing Tool], August 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, a fast-growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods. However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to dehumanize the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]], i.e. major reductions of the work force,&lt;ref&gt;(Greenbaum 1995, Industry Week 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and a rebirth of [[Taylorism]] under a different label.

Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.&lt;ref name="AAAI"&gt;[http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031 Hamscher, Walter: "AI in Business-Process Reengineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311194739/http://aaaipress.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1113/1031|date=11 March 2014}}, AI Magazine Volume 15 Number 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study ''Made in America'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Dertouzos, Robert M. Solow and Richard K. Lester (1989) ''Made In America: Regaining the Productive Edge''. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, [[time-to-market]] and [[productivity]].

=== Development after 1995 ===
With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some{{Who|date=August 2016}} of the early BPR proponents{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed.

More recently, the concept of [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for process efficiency supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change.

== Topics ==
The most notable definitions of reengineering are:
* "... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer and Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human, and organizational dimensions."&lt;ref name="dav93"&gt;[[Thomas H. Davenport]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson ''et al.'' (1993):  "Business Process Reengineering, although a close relative, seeks radical rather than merely continuous improvement. It escalates the efforts of JIT and TQM to make process orientation a strategic tool and a core competence of the organization. BPR concentrates on core business processes, and uses the specific techniques within the JIT and TQM ”toolboxes” as enablers, while broadening the process vision."&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of [[information technology]] (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR – organization, technology, strategy, and people – where a process view is used as common framework for considering these dimensions.

Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of [[communication technology]] in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / [[human resources]] dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality.

===The role of information technology===
Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca0b8dc-dfc0-11df-bed9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VySiR5f7 Business efficiency: IT can help paint a bigger picture, Financial Times, featuring Ian Manocha, Lynne Munns and Andy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

BPR literature&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hammer &amp; Champy (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several so called ''disruptive technologies'' that were supposed to challenge traditional wisdom about how work should be performed.
* Shared databases, making information available at many places  
* Expert systems, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
* Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
* Decision-support tools, allowing decision-making to be a part of everybody's job
* [[Wireless data communication]] and [[portable computer]]s, allowing field personnel to work office independent
* Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers
* Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found
* High performance computing, allowing on-the-fly planning and revisioning

In the mid-1990s, especially workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP ([[enterprise resource planning]]) vendors, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[JD Edwards]], Oracle, [[PeopleSoft]], positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement.

===Research and methodology ===
[[Image:Bpr1.png|thumb|240px|Model based on PRLC approach]]
Although the labels and steps differ slightly, the early methodologies that were rooted in IT-centric BPR solutions share many of the same basic principles and elements. The following outline is one such model, based on the PRLC (Process Reengineering Life Cycle) approach developed by Guha.&lt;ref&gt;Guha et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified schematic outline of using a business process approach, exemplified for pharmaceutical R&amp;D
# Structural organization with functional units
# Introduction of New Product Development as cross-functional process
# Re-structuring and streamlining activities, removal of non-value adding tasks

Benefiting from lessons learned from the early adopters, some BPR practitioners advocated a change in emphasis to a customer-centric, as opposed to an IT-centric, methodology.  One such methodology, that also incorporated a Risk and Impact Assessment to account for the effect that BPR can have on jobs and operations, was described by Lon Roberts (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lon Roberts (1994) ''Process reengineering: the key to achieving breakthrough success''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also stressed the use of change management tools to proactively address resistance to change—a factor linked to the demise of many reengineering initiatives that looked good on the drawing board.

Some items to use on a process analysis checklist are: Reduce handoffs, Centralize data, Reduce delays, Free resources faster, Combine similar activities. Also within the management consulting industry, a significant number of methodological approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;A set of short papers, outlining and comparing some of them can be found here, followed by some guidelines for companies considering to contract a consultancy for a BPR initiative:

=== Framework ===
An easy to follow seven step INSPIRE framework is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are '''Initiate''' a new process reengineering project and prepare a business case for the same; '''Negotiate''' with senior management to get approval to start the process reengineering project; '''Select''' the key processes that need to be reengineered; '''Plan''' the process reengineering activities; '''Investigate''' the processes to analyze the problem areas; '''Redesign''' the selected processes to improve the performance and '''Ensure''' the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.

== Factors for success and failure ==
{{tone|date=February 2014}}
Factors that are important to BPR success include:

# BPR team composition.
# Business needs analysis.
# Adequate IT infrastructure.
# Effective [[change management]]. 
# Ongoing continuous improvement

The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities and performance measurements, incentive systems, skills development, and the use of IT. BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today.  Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure.

If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Productivity Organization: Business Process re-engineering. http://www.apo-tokyo.org/productivity/pmtt_016.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include:

# One department may be optimized at the expense of another
# Lack of time to focus on improving business process
# Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem
# Lack of training
# People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] to fix problems
# Inadequate infrastructure
# Overly bureaucratic processes
# Lack of motivation

Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed.  Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them.  As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"&gt;(Covert, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process.  Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.&lt;ref&gt;(Berman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization-wide commitment ===
Major changes to business processes have a direct effect on processes, technology, job roles, and workplace culture.  Significant changes to even one of those areas require resources, money, and leadership.  Changing them simultaneously is an extraordinary task.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt; Like any large and complex undertaking, implementing reengineering requires the talents and energies of a broad spectrum of experts.  Since BPR can involve multiple areas within the organization, it is important to get support from all affected departments. Through the involvement of selected department members, the organization can gain valuable input before a process is implemented; a step which promotes both the cooperation and the vital acceptance of the reengineered process by all segments of the organization.

Getting enterprise wide commitment involves the following: top management sponsorship, bottom-up buy-in from process users, dedicated BPR team, and budget allocation for the total solution with measures to demonstrate value. Before any BPR project can be implemented successfully, there must be a commitment to the project by the management of the organization, and strong leadership must be provided.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"&gt;(Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Reengineering efforts can by no means be exercised without a company-wide commitment to the goals.  However, top management commitment is imperative for success.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"&gt;(Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  Top management must recognize the need for change, develop a complete understanding of what BPR is, and plan how to achieve it.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"&gt;(Motwani, et al., 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership has to be effective, strong, visible, and creative in thinking and understanding in order to provide a clear [[company vision|vision]].&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"&gt;(Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Convincing every affected group within the organization of the need for BPR is a key step in successfully implementing a process.  By informing all affected groups at every stage, and emphasizing the positive end results of the reengineering process, it is possible to minimize resistance to change and increase the odds for success. The ultimate success of BPR depends on the strong, consistent, and continuous involvement of all departmental levels within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;(King, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team composition ===
Once organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the reengineering effort and at different levels, the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization. The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows: 
* competency of the members of the team, their motivation,&lt;ref&gt;(Rastogi, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* their credibility within the organization and their creativity,&lt;ref&gt;(Barrett, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques,&lt;ref name="Carr, 1993"&gt;(Carr, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* effective team leadership,&lt;ref&gt;(Berrington &amp; Oblich, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* proper organization of the team,&lt;ref&gt;(Guha, et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and 
* specificity of goals.&lt;ref&gt;(Katzenbach &amp; Smith, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups: top management, business area responsible for the process being addressed, technology groups, finance, and members of all ultimate process users’ groups. Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the reengineered process according to their desired requirements.  The BPR team should be mixed in depth and knowledge.  For example, it may include members with the following characteristics:

* Members who do not know the process at all.
* Members who know the process inside-out.
* Customers, if possible.
* Members representing affected departments.
* One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts.
* Members from outside of the organization&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

Moreover, Covert (1997) recommends that in order to have an effective BPR team, it must be kept under ten players.  If the organization fails to keep the team at a manageable size, the entire process will be much more difficult to execute efficiently and effectively.  The efforts of the team must be focused on identifying breakthrough opportunities and designing new work steps or processes that will create quantum gains and competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Motwani, et al., 1998"/&gt;

=== Business needs analysis ===
Another important factor in the success of any BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis.  Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs reengineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR.  These sessions build a consensus as to the vision of the ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model.  Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process.  Results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project.

This plan includes the following: 
* identifying specific problem areas, 
* solidifying particular goals, and 
* defining business objectives.  
The business needs analysis contributes tremendously to the re-engineering effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine where it should focus its improvements efforts.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;

The business needs analysis also helps in relating the BPR project goals back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization.  This linkage should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the re-engineering effort. This alignment must be demonstrated from the perspective of financial performance, customer service, associate value, and the vision for the organization.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Developing a business vision and process objectives relies, on the one hand, on a clear understanding of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and on the other, on awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"&gt;(Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
BPR projects that are not in alignment with the organization’s strategic direction can be counterproductive.  There is always a possibility that an organization may make significant investments in an area that is not a core competency for the company and later outsource this capability.  Such reengineering initiatives are wasteful and steal resources from other strategic projects. Moreover, without strategic alignment, the organization’s key stakeholders and sponsors may find themselves unable to provide the level of support the organization needs in terms of resources, especially if there are other more critical projects to the future of the business, and are more aligned with the strategic direction.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;

=== Adequate IT infrastructure ===
Researchers consider adequate [[IT infrastructure]] reassessment and composition as a vital factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  Hammer (1990) prescribes the use of IT to challenge the assumptions inherent in the work process that have existed since long before the advent of modern computer and communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Factors related to IT infrastructure have been increasingly considered by many researchers and practitioners as a vital component of successful BPR efforts.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"&gt;(Ross, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Effective alignment of IT infrastructure and BPR strategy, 
* building an effective IT infrastructure,
* adequate IT infrastructure investment decision, 
* adequate measurement of IT infrastructure effectiveness,
* proper information systems (IS) integration, 
* effective reengineering of legacy IS, 
* increasing IT function competency, and 
* effective use of software tools are the most important factors that contribute to the success of BPR projects.

These are vital factors that contribute to building an effective IT infrastructure for business processes.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;  BPR must be accompanied by strategic planning which addresses leveraging IT as a competitive tool.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"&gt;(Weicher, et al., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; An IT infrastructure is made up of physical assets, intellectual assets, shared services,&lt;ref&gt;(Broadbent &amp; Weill, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and their linkages.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"&gt;(Kayworth, et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which the IT infrastructure components are composed and their linkages determines the extent to which information resources can be delivered.  An effective IT infrastructure composition process follows a top-down approach, beginning with business strategy and IS strategy and passing through designs of data, systems, and computer architecture.&lt;ref&gt;(Malhotra, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Linkages between the IT infrastructure components, as well as descriptions of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT infrastructure components.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt;  Furthermore, IT standards have a major role in reconciling various infrastructure components to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets.&lt;ref name="Kayworth, et al., 1997"/&gt; The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT infrastructure components, in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition.  IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Al-Mashari &amp; Zairi, 1999"/&gt;

Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked.  Walmart, for example, would not have been able to reengineer the processes used to procure and distribute mass-market retail goods without IT.  Ford was able to decrease its headcount in the procurement department by 75 percent by using IT in conjunction with BPR, in another well-known example.&lt;ref name="Weicher, et al., 1995"/&gt; The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the information requirements for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR.&lt;ref name="Ross, 1998"/&gt; Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs.  This, in turn, is determined by the types of activities embedded in a business process, and their sequencing and reliance on other organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;(Sabherwal &amp; King, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effective change management ===
Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) suggest that BPR involves changes in people behavior and culture, processes, and technology.  As a result, there are many factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. [[Change management]], which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance, is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort.One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementers believe will benefit the most.  Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort.  Many people fail to understand that change is not an event, but rather a management technique.

Change management is the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines.&lt;ref name="Covert, 1997"/&gt;  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.  An important step towards any successful reengineering effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  It is a well-known fact that organizations do not change unless people change; the better change is managed, the less painful the transition is.

[[Organizational culture]] is a determining factor in successful BPR implementation.&lt;ref&gt;(Zairi &amp; Sinclair, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizational culture influences the organization’s ability to adapt to change.  Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.  Culture is one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively.  Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture.  Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.

The first step towards any successful transformation effort is to convey an understanding of the necessity for change.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  Management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols, and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture. Implementing BPR successfully is dependent on how thoroughly management conveys the new cultural messages to the organization.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;  These messages provide people in the organization with a guideline to predict the outcome of acceptable behavior patterns.  People should be the focus for any successful business change.
  
BPR is not a recipe for successful business transformation if it focuses on only computer technology and process redesign.  In fact, many BPR projects have failed because they did not recognize the importance of the human element in implementing BPR.  Understanding the people in organizations, the current company culture, motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR.  If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Kleiner, 1997"/&gt;

=== Ongoing continuous improvement ===
Many organizational change theorists hold a common view of organizations adjusting gradually and incrementally and responding locally to individual crises as they arise&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt; Common elements are:  
* BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy that enables an organization to make the move from traditional functional orientation to one that aligns with strategic business processes.&lt;ref name="Vakola &amp; Rezgui, 2000"/&gt;  
* Continuous improvement is defined as the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services.&lt;ref name="Dooley &amp; Johnson, 2001"/&gt;  The incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle.  
* It is essential that the automation infrastructure of the BPR activity provides for performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements.  It will need to efficiently capture appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals.  
* To ensure that the process generates the desired benefits, it must be tested before it is deployed to the end users.  If it does not perform satisfactorily, more time should be taken to modify the process until it does.  
* A fundamental concept for quality practitioners is the use of feedback loops at every step of the process and an environment that encourages constant evaluation of results and individual efforts to improve.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"&gt;(Gore, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* At the end user’s level, there must be a proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilitates resolutions of problems and issues.  This will also contribute to a continuous risk assessment and evaluation which are needed throughout the implementation process to deal with any risks at their initial state and to ensure the success of the reengineering efforts.  
* Anticipating and planning for risk handling is important for dealing effectively with any risk when it first occurs and as early as possible in the BPR process.&lt;ref&gt;(Clemons, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is interesting that many of the successful applications of reengineering described by its proponents are in organizations practicing continuous improvement programs.  
* Hammer and Champy (1993) use the IBM Credit Corporation as well as Ford and Kodak, as examples of companies that carried out BPR successfully due to the fact that they had long-running continuous improvement programs.&lt;ref name="Gore, 1999"/&gt;

In conclusion, successful BPR can potentially create substantial improvements in the way organizations do business and can actually produce fundamental improvements for business operations.  However, in order to achieve that, there are some key success factors that must be taken into consideration when performing BPR.

BPR success factors are a collection of lessons learned from reengineering projects and from these lessons common themes have emerged.  In addition, the ultimate success of BPR depends on the people who do it and on how well they can be committed and motivated to be creative and to apply their detailed knowledge to the reengineering initiative. Organizations planning to undertake BPR must take into consideration the success factors of BPR in order to ensure that their reengineering related change efforts are comprehensive, well-implemented, and have minimum chance of failure. This has been very beneficial in all terms

== Critique ==
Many companies used reengineering as a pretext to [[layoff|downsizing]], though this was not the intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, reengineering earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2008/09/06000936/Michael-Hammer-who-made-reeng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many circumstances, reengineering has not always lived up to its expectations. Some prominent reasons include:
* Reengineering assumes that the factor that limits an organization's performance is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which may or may not be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption.
* Reengineering assumes the need to start the process of performance improvement with a "clean slate," i.e. totally disregard the ''[[status quo]].''
* According to [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (and his [[Theory of Constraints]]) reengineering does not provide an effective way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

Others have claimed that reengineering was a recycled [[buzzword]] for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the [[assembly line]] in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking in an organization).

The most frequent critique against BPR concerns the strict focus on efficiency and technology and the disregard of people in the organization that is subjected to a reengineering initiative. Very often, the label BPR was used for major workforce reductions. Thomas Davenport, an early BPR proponent, stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I wrote about "business process redesign" in 1990, I explicitly said that using it for cost reduction alone was not a sensible goal. And consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two names most closely associated with reengineering, have insisted all along that layoffs shouldn't be the point. But the fact is, once out of the bottle, the reengineering genie quickly turned ugly."&lt;ref&gt;(Davenport, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hammer similarly admitted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wasn't smart enough about that. I was reflecting my engineering background and was insufficient appreciative of the human dimension. I've learned that's critical."&lt;ref&gt;(White, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9312">A '''business rule''' defines or constrains some aspect of [[business]] and always resolves to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.&lt;ref name="BRG1" /&gt; Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization.  Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For example, a business rule might state that ''no credit check is to be performed on return customers''.  Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules.

While a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they don't conflict is a valuable activity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  When carefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Introduction==
'''Business rules'''  tell an organization ''what'' it can do in detail, while strategy tells it ''how'' to focus the business at a macro level to optimize results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Put differently, a strategy provides high-level direction about what an organization should do. Business rules provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated to action.

Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organization's consciousness.  However it is a fairly common practice for organizations to gather business rules.  This may happen in one of two ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Organizations may choose to proactively describe their business practices, producing a database of rules.  While this activity may be beneficial, it may be expensive and time-consuming.  For example, they might hire a consultant to comb through the organization to document and consolidate the various standards and methods currently in practice.

Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or [[business rule mining]]. The [[business analyst]] or consultant can extract the rules from IT documentation (like use cases, specifications or system code).  They may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (commonly abbreviated as SMEs). Software technologies designed to capture business rules through analysis of legacy source code or of actual user behavior can accelerate the rule gathering processing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

More commonly, business rules are discovered and documented informally during the initial stages of a project.  In this case the collecting of the business rules is incidental.  In addition, business projects, such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process, might lead to the definition of new business rules.  This practice of incidental, or emergent, business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units, or within the same organizational unit over time. This inconsistency creates problems that can be difficult to find and fix.

Allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner, they are not valuable.  In order to teach business people about the best ways to gather and document business rules, experts in business analysis have created the [[business rules approach|Business Rules Methodology]].  This methodology defines a process of capturing business rules in natural language, in a verifiable and understandable way.  This process is not difficult to learn, can be performed in real-time, and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner.

== Categories ==

According to the white paper by the Business Rules Group,&lt;ref name="BRG1"&gt;Business Rules Group, ''Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?'', [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/first_paper/br01c0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories:
*Definitions of business terms
The most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a business rule that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of business rule. Terms have traditionally been documented in a [[Glossary]] or as entities in a [[Conceptual schema|conceptual model]].

*Facts relating terms to each other
The nature or operating structure of an organization can be described in terms of the facts that relate terms to each other. To say that a customer can place an order is NOT a business rule, but a ''fact''. '''Facts''' can be documented as natural language sentences or as relationships, attributes, and generalization structures in a graphical model.

*Constraints (also called "action assertions")
Every enterprise constrains behavior in some way, and this is closely related to constraints on what data may or may not be updated. To prevent a record from being made is, in many cases, to prevent an action from taking place.

*Derivations
Business rules (including laws of nature) define how [[knowledge]] in one form may be transformed into other knowledge, possibly in a different form.

== Real world applications and obstacles ==

Business rules are gathered in these situations: 
# When dictated by law
# During the [[business analysis]]
# As an [[ephemeral]] [[aid]] to engineers.
  
This lack of consistent approach is mostly due to the cost and effort required to maintain the list of rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

While newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution, it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct, and each provides value that is different from the other.  Software packages automate business rules using [[business logic]].  The term ''business rule'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''business logic''; however the latter connotes an engineering practice and the former an intrinsic business practice{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.  There is value in outlining an organization's business rules regardless of whether this information is used to automate its operations.

One of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic, and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language. Translation for engines is easier, but business users will no longer be able to write down the rules.

== Formal specification ==

Business rules can be expressed using modeling approaches such as [[Unified Modeling Language]], [[Z notation]], [[Business Process Execution Language]], [[Business Process Modeling Notation]], [[Decision Model and Notation]] or the [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Business rules encoded in computer code in an operational program are known as [[business logic]].

Similar to how [[Business Risks]] can be structured as:

If &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

a Business Rule can be structured as:

When &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;imposition(s)&gt; Otherwise &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

Headquartered in [[Barcelona]], it currently operates globally through a network of 40 offices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalonia.com/about_us.jsp Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment - WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission== 
Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment’s mission is to promote innovation, internationalisation, trade and funding of Catalan companies and startups. It also provides support, insight and advice to international companies interested in investing in [[Catalonia]] and Barcelona.&lt;ref name="estatutos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Departament d'Empresa i Ocupació&lt;/small&gt;|trans-title=Department of Business and Employment|year=2015|url=http://portaldogc.gencat.cat/utilsEADOP/PDF/6976/1449764.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2008 as a result of merging the public office Commercial Promotion Consortium of Catalonia (Catalan: Consorci de Promoció Comercial de Catalunya, COPCA) and the Innovation and Business Development Center (Catalan: Centre d'Innovació i Desenvolupament Empresarial, CIDEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duran |first1=Manuel |title=Mediterranean Paradiplomacies: The Dynamics of Diplomatic Reterritorialization |date=2015 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |isbn=978-90-04-28540-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first foreign office of COPCA and CIDEM was established in [[Tokyo]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Japan Action Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Action Plan of the Government of Catalonia 2016-2019|year=2016|url=http://exteriors.gencat.cat/web/.content/saeue/afers_exteriors_cooperacio/04_arees_actuacio/Pla_Catalunya_Japo/Pla-Japo_2016-2019_angles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period the first American office in [[New York City|New York]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=García |first1=Caterina |title=Democratic Spain: Reshaping External Relations in a Changing World |date=1995 |publisher=Richard Gillespie, Fernando Rodrigo, Jonathan Story |location=London, UK |isbn=978-0-415-11325-0 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 two offices were opened in [[Europe]] ([[London]] and [[Paris]]) and one in North Africa ([[Casablanca]]). In 1992 the first Middle East office in [[Dubai]] was opened.&lt;ref name="CataloniaConnects"&gt;{{cite web|title=CataloniaConnects|year=2016|url=http://www.accio.gencat.cat/web/.content/05_ACCIO/patrocini-col-laboracions/docs/catalonia-connects.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since COPCA and CIDEM merged and became Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment, the number of exterior offices has grown until the current 40. In fact, the latest offices were opened in 2017 in [[Amsterdam]], [[Nairobi]], [[Tehran]] and [[Zagreb]]-[[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government to open six new trade and investment offices worldwide |url=http://www.catalannews.com/business/item/government-to-open-six-new-trade-and-investment-offices-worldwide |accessdate=16 July 2018 |agency=ACN |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency covers 100 markets in the five continents.&lt;ref name="Connect to Acció"&gt;{{cite web|title=Connect to Acció|year=2017|url=http://www.accio.gencat.cat/web/.content/01_Serveis/cartera-de-serveis/doc/cartera-de-serveis-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In financial analysis, a '''channel check''' is third-party research on a company's business based on collecting information from the [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] of the company. It may be conducted in order to [[Valuation (finance)|value]] the company, to perform [[due diligence]] in various contexts, and the like. Industries where channel checks are more often conducted include retail, technology, commodities, etc.

It is a practice performed by third party researchers and financial analysts in order to collect information about a company’s business. The Channel Check process includes interviewing people within other organizations connected to the company’s [[supply chain|supply]] and distribution channels. These interviews usually occur without the target company’s knowledge. For example, a channel check could include one or multiple conversations with a store manager to understand their targeted customer. Analysts generally look for top products, customer buying patterns and past performance.

Analysts could also contact one or several suppliers or vendors to obtain information about the targeted company. In these interviews analysts are looking for quantity of materials being demanded and prices. Suppliers could also help Analysts to see the “Bigger Picture” of a company’s production plans, new products and more. Suppliers may also give an indication of the raw material availability, finished product inventory levels, promotion plans to the Analysts.

Channel checks can give insights complementary to [[balance sheet]] analysis, such as distributor and retailer attitudes towards a product and its competitors, [[seasonality|seasonal]] and geographic variation, [[inventory]] levels (notably [[channel stuffing]]), and so on.

'''Colocation''' (or '''co-location''') is the act of placing multiple (sometimes related) entities within a single location.

==Examples==
* In an organization, it refers to placing related roles or groups in a single room, building or campus.
* In business, it refers to the practice of locating multiple similar businesses in the same facility.
* In trading, it often refers to placing multiple data centers in proximity to trading centers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedtrading.com/ivyschmerken/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=YAMNAXILVBKFVQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=220300263&amp;pgno=2 High-Frequency Trading Shops Play the Colocation Game], ''Advanced Trading'', Ivy Schmerken.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In telecommunications, primarily wireless telecommunications facilities such as mobile wireless (cell sites) and radio broadcasting, it refers to the practice of locating multiple wireless broadcast facilities/providers within the same facility. Many jurisdictions now mandate colocation of mobile wireless carriers within a single facility to avoid the proliferation of wireless communication towers.
* In the [[fast food restaurant]] industry, one primary use of this concept is [[Yum! Brands]] with its [[KFC]], [[Taco Bell]], and [[Pizza Hut]] menus appearing in the same restaurant. All of the [[WingStreet]] chain locations are co-located with [[Pizza Hut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeywcIPd7ScC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Yum!+brands+and+colocation+of+its+restaurant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CHg-09XOn1&amp;sig=HrFos6lNMOhIcCmw3x6Hivm5rlw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6teDck4fZAhVBuBQKHdZEBIgQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Yum!%20brands%20and%20colocation%20of%20its%20restaurant&amp;f=false|title=Student Achievement Series: Principles of Management|last=Griffin|first=Ricky W.|date=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0618730788|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In the retail sector, [[Sears Holdings]] often operates its large format [[Sears]] stores with an income tax services office, an optical shop, and other independent operations. [[Walmart]] is also known for this, in addition to including fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] or [[Dunkin' Donuts]] within its stores.
* In the airline industry, colocation commonly occurs at [[airports]]. Airline alliances will be assigned or build a fortress out of certain terminals or dominant carrier-specific terminals; [[Star Alliance]] in particular makes colocation in a single terminal alliance policy (termed "Move Under One Roof"). An example would be at Tokyo's [[Narita Airport]], where local carrier [[All Nippon Airways]], a Star Alliance member, and its partners operate in one terminal to facilitate partner connections and product offerings, even offering combined check-in, member lounges, and ground services.

==Data==
Colocation is often used in the data sourcing industry to mean off-site data storage, usually in a [[data center]]. This is very important for businesses since the loss of data can be crucial for companies of any size, up to and including disciplinary action for employees or loss of their job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/616422/Fear_of_Data_Loss_Social_Media_Security_Risks_Rising Fear of Data Loss, Social Media Security Risks Rising], ''CIO Magazine'', Joan Goodchild, 20 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An unexpected loss in data can result from fires, earthquakes, floods, or any sort of natural disaster.

Data colocation technology began to take hold in the telecommunications industry. Colocation enables multiple customers to access network, server, and data storage space, connecting them to a variety of service providers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140116134017/http://resources.cio.com/ccd/assets/18525/detail Colocation: The Logical Home for the Cloud], ''[[Computerworld]]'', Cyrus One.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3873">[[Image:kimfisher zeds.jpg|thumb|right|Comp cards]]
A '''comp card''' (also called '''composite card''', '''z card''', '''zed card''' or '''sed card''') is a [[marketing]] tool for actors and especially [[Model (person)|models]].  They serve as the latest and best of a model's [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] and are used as a [[business card]]. A [[Z-CARD]] is also a folded leaflet format, typically used for marketing communications campaigns for example a loyalty programme or seasonal promotion.

==History==
Peter Marlowe in London invented models composites in 1965, then printed on paper to [[DIN A4|A4]] format.&lt;ref&gt;“Model” (1995) by Michael Gross p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Molyneux (April 1989 &amp; May 1989) Marlowe Press - The Story, Model Journal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The format was changed in 1972 to [[DIN A5|A5]] card format, for filing purposes, and a few other companies started publishing cards for the model industry under different trade names since Peter Marlowe had registered the trademark “Model Composite” in Europe and the USA. Amongst these was Sebastian Sed who traded under the name Sed Cards, which are sometimes mis-pronounced as Z ("Zed") or Set cards. The publishing house of Marlowe Press stopped trading in 1990 and the words "models composites" and "comp cards" became generic within the model industry. Comp card databases and creation tools have moved online in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Model woman : Eileen Ford and the business of beauty|last=Lacey|first=Robert|publisher=Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-0062108074|location=New York, NY|pages=199, 200, 206, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A comp card typically contains a minimum of two pages – a cover page with full size portrait and a second page with a selection of  representative shots from the portfolio. It lists the model's basic stats &amp;ndash; typically height, weight, [[three sizes]]  (bust, waist, hips) for women, suit or chest size and waist and inseam sizes for men, plus [[shoe size]], eye and [[hair color]], nationality and contact information. It is printed on both sides of an 8.5" x 5.5" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessofmodeling.com/comp-cards/what-is-a-comp-card/&lt;/ref&gt; piece of [[card stock]] (12 pt stock) (US) or A5 on card weight (350/400&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stock in metric countries) which is between 300 and 450&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] thick depending on the card stock or quality chosen (Europe, Asia).

==Use==
Comp cards have been around for many years as the essential marketing tool for a model and are likely to retain this standing because they are an inexpensive way to effectively and professionally showcase a model's ability. Composite cards are used on three major levels &amp;ndash; they are used by models, agents and the agent's client

==Production==
Currently, models have many different options of creating comp cards. They can ask their photographer or create their own on their computers using image editing or [[graphics software]]. In addition, with technology's increasingly strong influence in the digital market, many printing companies have looked to the internet to facilitate the ordering process. Comp card printing prices can vary depending on the number of pictures used on the card, the type of paper stock used, and the general printing quality. Different layout styles are available or can be created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">'''Consumer relationship systems''' ('''CRS''') are specialized [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) [[software]] applications that are used to handle a company's dealings with its customers.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50"&gt;[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cmp/cmi_200709/index.php ICMI Customer Management Insight Magazine, September 2007, pp 44–50], Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Current consumer relationship systems integrate the [[software]] with telephone and call recording systems as well as with corporate systems for input and reporting. Customers can provide input from the company's website directly into the CRS. These systems are popular because they can deliver the 'voice of the consumer' that contributes to product quality improvement and that ultimately increases corporate profits.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50" /&gt;

Consumer relationship systems that provide automated support as well as advanced systems may have [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) interfaces that can extract and analyse [[data]] collected, or handle basic questions and complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith| first1=S.E.|title= What is Consumer Relationship System? |date= |publisher= WiseGeek.net|url= http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-consumer-relationship-system.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first CRS was developed in the 1980s. In 1981 Michael Wilke and Robert Thornton founded Wilke/Thornton, Inc in [[Columbus, Ohio]], to develop new CRS software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html Wilke/Thornton, Inc Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093347/http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html |date=2008-08-20 }} Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}

[[File:New McDonald's restaurant in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] is one of the most recognizable corporations in the world.]]

A '''corporation''' is a [[company]], a group of people or an organization authorized to act as a single entity ([[legal person|legally a person]]) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by [[charter]] (i.e. by an ''ad hoc'' act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through [[List of company registers|registration]].  Corporations enjoy limited liability for their investors, which can lead to losses being externalized from investors to the government or general public.&lt;ref name="Known"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Limited Liability and the Known Unknown|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=2018|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue [[stock]] or not, or by whether they are formed to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corpnet.com/types-of-corporations/#gfp|title=Types Of Corporations {{!}} Incorporate A Business|website=www.corpnet.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where local law distinguishes corporations by the ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as "stock corporations", ownership of the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as "stockholders" or "shareholders". Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as "non-stock" corporations; those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a "member" of the corporation.

Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as "for profit" and "not-for-profit" corporations, respectively.

There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock&lt;!-- non-stock --&gt;. To simplify the explanation, whenever "[[Shareholder|Stockholder]]" or "[[shareholder]]" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as "member" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation.

Registered corporations have [[legal personality]] and their shares are owned by shareholders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Company Law |last1=Pettet |first1=B. G. |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2005 |page=151 |quote=Reading the above, makes it possible to forget that the shareholders are the ''owners'' of the company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of Private Companies |first1=Thomas B. |last1=Courtney |publisher=Bloomsbury Professional |year=2002 |edition=2nd |at=4.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose liability is generally [[limited liability|limited]] to their investment.  Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a [[board of directors]] to control the corporation in a [[fiduciary]] capacity.  In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.

In [[American English]], the word ''corporation'' is most often used to describe large [[Corporate law|business corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/corporation corporation].

Retrieved December 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] and in the [[Commonwealth countries]], the term ''company'' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word ''corporation'' encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word ''company'' can include entities such as [[partnership]]s that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a [[separate legal entity]].

Late in the 19th century, a new form of company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' or ''GmbH''. In the last quarter of the 20th Century this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the ''[[limited liability company]]'' or ''LLC''. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.

==History==

[[File: Stora Kopparberg 1288.jpg|thumb|1/8 share of the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mine, dated June 16, 1288.]]
The word "corporation" derives from ''corpus'', the [[Latin]] word for body, or a "body of people". By the time of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (reigned 527–565), [[Roman law]] recognized a range of corporate entities under the names ''universitas'', ''corpus'' or ''collegium''. These included the state itself (the ''Populus Romanus''), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a [[Cult (religious practice)|religious cult]], [[Burial society|burial clubs]], political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Joseph Berman, ''Law and Revolution'' (vol. 1)'': The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983, pp. 215–16. {{ISBN|0674517768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in [[ancient Rome]], and the [[Maurya Empire]] in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Vikramaditya S. Khanna (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id= ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments, such as the [[Pope]] and the [[City of London Corporation]]. The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mining community in [[Falun]], [[Sweden]], obtained a [[charter]] from King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] in 1347.

In medieval times, traders would do business through [[common law]] constructs, such as [[partnership]]s. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose. Early [[guild]]s and [[Livery company|livery companies]] were also often involved in the [[restraint of trade|regulation of competition]] between traders.

[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), dating from 1623, for the amount of 2,400 florins]]

The progenitors of the modern corporation were the chartered companies, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which were created to lead the colonial ventures of European nations in the 17th century. Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the Dutch East India Company defeated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and established itself in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan Islands]] in order to profit from the [[Europe]]an demand for [[spice]]s. Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Shareholders were also explicitly granted [[limited liability]] in the company's royal charter.&lt;ref&gt;Om Prakash, ''European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the government created corporations under a [[royal charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament]] with the grant of a [[monopoly]] over a specified territory. The best-known example, established in 1600, was the [[East India Company]] of [[London]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became [[Company rule in India|increasingly integrated]] with English and later British military and colonial policy, just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the [[Royal Navy]]'s ability to control trade routes.

Labeled by both contemporaries and historians as "the grandest society of merchants in the universe", the English East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay, ''The Honorable Company: A History of the English East India Company'' (MacMillan, New York 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the [[East Indies]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~gerard/romanticpolitics/britisheastindia.html|title=British East India Company|first=Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud, Stephanie Metz, Jody Dunville, Shannon Heath, Julia P. McLeod, Kat Powell, Brent Robida, John Stromski, Brandon|last=Haynes|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1711, shareholders in the East India Company were earning a [[return on investment|return on their investment]] of almost 150 per cent. Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the Company had become. Its first stock offering in 1713–1716 raised £418,000, its second in 1717–1722 raised £1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' at p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|left|Chart of the [[South Sea Company]]'s stock prices. The rapid inflation of the stock value in the 1710s led to the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which restricted the establishment of companies without a [[royal charter]].]]
A similar [[chartered company]], the [[South Sea Company]], was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed in 1713 as a settlement following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which gave [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] an ''[[asiento]]'' to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from [[Corporate promoter|company promoters]] bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the [[Government debt|public debt]] of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had "burst", and the share price sank from £1000 to under £100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter.

In the late 18th century, [[Stewart Kyd]], the author of the first treatise on [[corporate law]] in English, defined a corporation as:

{{quote|a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having [[perpetual succession]] under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.|A Treatise on the Law of Corporations, Stewart Kyd (1793–1794)}}

===Modern company law===
Due to the late 18th century abandonment of [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory and the rise of [[classical liberalism]] and [[laissez-faire]] economic theory due to a revolution in [[economics]] led by [[Adam Smith]] and other economists, corporations transitioned from being government or [[guild]] affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of governmental directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://political-economy.com/adam-smith-laissez-faire/|title=Adam Smith Laissez-Faire|website=political-economy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote in his 1776 work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), Book V, ch 1, para 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deregulation====
[[File: Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]
The British Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825. By this point, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825]], 6 Geo 4, c 91&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions, though business ventures (such as those chronicled by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'') under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, proverbial operations like the "Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company" were undercapitalised ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters.&lt;ref&gt;See [[C Dickens]], ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' (1843) [[s:Martin Chuzzlewit/Chapter 27|ch 27]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] was possible only through a [[royal charter]] or a [[local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private act]] and was limited, owing to Parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as [[Voluntary association|unincorporated associations]] with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent [[Lawsuit|litigation]] had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies.

Then, in 1843, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] became the chairman of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], regarded as the first modern piece of company law.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies'' (1844) in ''British Parliamentary Papers'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created the [[Registrar of Companies|Registrar of Joint Stock Companies]], empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost £5 and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another £5. For the first time in history, it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQflMqcZyOoC|title=Introduction to Company Law|author=Paul Lyndon Davies|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of establishing a company as a [[Legal personality|separate legal person]] was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled.

====Limited liability====
However, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co., Greenwood's Case'' (1854) 3 De GM&amp;G 459&lt;/ref&gt; The next, crucial development, then, was the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr. [[Robert Lowe]]. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company – [[shareholder]]s were still liable directly to [[creditor]]s, but just for the unpaid portion of their [[share (finance)|shares]]. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844).

The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance|Insurance companies]] were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]].

This prompted the English periodical ''[[The Economist]]'' to write in 1855 that "never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated. "&lt;ref&gt;Graeme G. Acheson &amp; John D. Turner, ''The Impact of Limited Liability on Ownership and Control: Irish Banking, 1877–1914'', School of Management and Economics, Queen's University of Belfast, available at {{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113082939/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }} and {{cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111172110/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major error of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later, when it claimed that, "[t]he economic historian of the future. . . may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability, as applied to trading corporations, a place of honour with [[James Watt|Watt]] and [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]], and other pioneers of the Industrial Revolution. "&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'', December 18, 1926, at 1053, as quoted in Mahoney, ''supra'', at 875.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two features – a simple registration procedure and limited liability – were subsequently codified into the landmark 1856 [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856|Joint Stock Companies Act]]. This was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which remained in force for the rest of the century, up to and including the time of the decision in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1897] AC 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation shortly gave way to a railway boom, and from then, the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century, depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses.

====Further developments====
[[File:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lindley LJ]] was the leading expert on partnerships and company law in the ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' case. The landmark case confirmed the [[corporate identity|distinct corporate identity]] of the company.]]
In 1892, [[Germany]] introduced the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] with a separate [[legal personality]] and limited liability even if all the shares of the company were held by only one person. This inspired other countries to introduce corporations of this kind.

The last significant development in the history of companies was the 1897 decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.

In the [[United States]], forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century. Many private firms, such as [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s steel company and [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]], avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a [[Trust law|trust]]). State governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century, although these were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power.&lt;ref name="Corporate Law textbook"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Smiddy|first1=Linda O.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Lawrence A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations: Cases, Materials, Problems|publisher=LexisNexis|year=2010|edition=Seventh|pages=228–31, 241|isbn=978-1-4224-7659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Jersey]] was the first state to adopt an "enabling" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzqaBv7X_sC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22new+jersey%22+%22first+state%22+%22business+corporation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=n5Af0liBo5&amp;sig=A2RRh_zOyS7W3CCMK4ZyG6Scmwk The Law of Business Organizations], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; in 1896. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.&lt;ref name = "Corporate Law textbook"/&gt;

The end of the 19th century saw the emergence of [[Holding company|holding companies]] and corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. Countries began enacting [[Competition law|anti-trust]] laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections.
The 20th century saw a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations by registration across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.

Starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward [[privatization]], the selling of publicly owned (or 'nationalised') services and enterprises to corporations. [[Deregulation]] (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy.

==Ownership and control==
A corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a [[joint-stock company]] the members are known as shareholders and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company, is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings.

In another kind of corporation, the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine who the corporation's members are. Who a member is depends on what kind of corporation is involved. In a [[worker cooperative]], the members are people who work for the cooperative. In a [[credit union]], the members are people who have accounts with the credit union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Finance |first1=Scott |last1=Besley |first2=Eugene |last2=Brigham |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=9780324655889 |edition=4th |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members. In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of committee structure.
* A single committee known as a [[board of directors]] is the method favored in most [[common law]] countries. Under this model, the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company.
* A two-tiered committee structure with a [[supervisory board]] and a [[Vorstand|managing board]] is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Company &amp; Commercial – Netherlands: In a nutshell – one-tier boards |date=10 April 2012 |publisher=International Law Office |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f4815d3b-0de3-44d3-81d8-16114b49b8d8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Historically, corporations were created by a charter granted by government. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a [[registered agent]] (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an [[Law of agency|agent]] or other legal representative of the corporation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Generally, a corporation files [[articles of incorporation]] with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create [[By-law|bylaws]] that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a [[foreign corporation]], and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to [[employment]], [[crime]]s, [[contract]]s, [[Lawsuit|civil actions]], and the like.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Naming===
Corporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, "The President and Fellows of Harvard College". Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, "12345678 Ontario Limited"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.

In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, "Incorporated" or "Inc." in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, "Limited" or "Ltd."). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others they are not.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. state of California is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and Ann Yvonne Walker, ''Marsh's California Corporation Law'', 4th ed., vol. 1 (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004), 5–15 — 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use puts everybody on [[constructive notice]] that they are dealing with an entity whose [[legal liability|liability]] is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word "'''company'''" alone to denote corporate status, since the word "[[company]]" may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a [[sole proprietorship]] but this is not generally the case elsewhere).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Personhood==
Despite not being individual human beings, corporations, as far as US law is concerned, are [[Legal personality|legal persons]], and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as natural persons do. For example, a corporation can own property, and can sue or be sued. Corporations can exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Rights of Companies: Exploring the Structure of ECHR Protection |first1=Marius |last1=Emberland |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-928983-7 |page=1 |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617104051/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Sect.8, especially Art.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) discusses the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations can be "dissolved" either by statutory operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders. [[Insolvency]] may result in a form of corporate failure, when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Business Corporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002] CHAPTER 57, Part 10&lt;/ref&gt; but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses, such as [[fraud]] and [[manslaughter]]. However, corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">'''Data Stream Mining''' is the process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous, rapid data records. A data stream is an ordered sequence of instances that in many applications of data stream mining can be read only once or a small number of times using limited computing and storage capabilities.

In many data stream mining applications, the goal is to predict the class or value of new instances in the data stream given some knowledge about the class membership or values of previous instances in the data stream.
Machine learning techniques can be used to learn this prediction task from labeled examples in an automated fashion.
Often, concepts from the field of [[incremental learning]] are applied to cope with structural changes, [[online Machine Learning|on-line learning]] and real-time demands. 
In many applications, especially operating within non-stationary environments, the distribution underlying the instances or the rules underlying their labeling may change over time, i.e. the goal of the prediction, the class to be predicted or the target value to be predicted, may change over time. This problem is referred to as [[concept drift]].

Examples of data streams include computer network traffic, phone conversations, ATM transactions, web searches, and sensor data.
Data stream mining can be considered a subfield of [[data mining]], [[machine learning]], and [[knowledge discovery]].

==Software for data stream mining==
* [[MOA (Massive Online Analysis)]]: free open-source software specific for mining data streams with concept drift. It has several machine learning algorithms ([[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[data clustering|clustering]], outlier detection and recommender systems).  Also it contains a prequential evaluation method, the EDDM concept drift methods, a reader of ARFF real datasets, and artificial stream generators as SEA concepts, STAGGER, [[rotating hyperplane]], random tree, and [[random radius based functions]]. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with [[Weka (machine learning)]].
* [[RapidMiner]]: commercial software for knowledge discovery, data mining, and machine learning also featuring data stream mining, learning time-varying concepts, and tracking drifting concept (if used in combination with its data stream mining plugin (formerly: Concept Drift plugin))

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6147">'''Desktop outsourcing''' is the process in which an [[organization]] contracts a third party to maintain and manage parts of its [[IT infrastructure]]. Contracts vary in depth and can range from [[Computer maintenance|Computer hard]]- and [[software maintenance]] to [[Desktop virtualisation]], [[SaaS]]-implementations and [[Helpdesk]] operation.  It is estimated, that 32% of U.S. and Canadian IT organisations make use of desktop outsourcing in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekker|first1=Scott|title=Should You Outsource Your Help Desk?|url=http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2014/09/01/Should-You-Outsource.aspx?Page=3|website=Redmond Magazine|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market reports suggest the adoption of [[BYOD]] policies to allow the end-user a free choice of devices in their working environment may increase this market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xbv6lv/global_desktop|website=Research and Markets|publisher=TechNavio|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop-Outsourcing im Trend|url=http://www.itadministrator.de/themen/virtualisierung/111035.html|website=ITAdministrator.de|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viability==
Justification for desktop outsourcing could include shifting focus and energy to areas of core competency, reducing staffing costs, and the routine maintenance, upgrades, and repairs associated with managing multitudes of PC systems and servers. (Applegate et al. 2007). Managers may also seek desktop outsourcing as a method of simplifying organisational structures to cut costs associated with them.&lt;ref name="dfcw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=David|title=Why outsource desktop management?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Why-outsource-desktop-management|website=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For smaller companies it might also be more viable financially to outsource their desktop at a set price per machine, rather than creating an entire internal IT department.&lt;ref name="littman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littman|first1=Dan|title=Outsourcing the desktop|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2655241/techology-business/outsourcing-the-desktop.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market growth can also be attributed to the decreasing price of hardware, making replacement more favourable than repairs.&lt;ref name="dfcw" /&gt; Possible risks when desktop outsourcing are ensuring continued support for old a unique systems the company depends on, specifically if any of the systems in question were internally developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Stephen|title=Managing Risk in Outsourcing: The Strategy|url=http://www.sourcingmag.com/managing-risk-in-outsourcing-the-strategy/|website=SourcingMag.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may cause the contractor to be unable to fulfil their contractual obligations, as in the case of the US Navy outsourcing their IT systems to EDS in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ephraim|title=Painful lessons from IT outsourcing gone bad|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2652801/outsourcing/painful-lessons-from-it-outsourcing-gone-bad.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market situation==
A 2012 TechNavio market report forecasts that the desktop outsourcing market will grow by 4.65% yearly, between 2012 and 2016. [[Atos]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[IBM]] are considered the leading desktop outsourcing vendors for that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research and Markets: Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016 Research Report|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-markets-global-desktop-outsourcing-104100265.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gartner]] report from 2013, however, considers the desktop outsourcing market to be in decline, with growth only occurring on the Latin American and Asia/Pacific markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide IT Outsourcing Market to Reach $288 Billion in 2013|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2550615|website=gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* While consolidating School Districts in 2003, New York city brought in Dell to assess and consolidate their IT systems. At the time it was unclear how many devices actually existed in the network. Being largely successful, this netted Dell a $20 million yearly contract to keep on managing the School Districts systems.&lt;ref name="littman" /&gt;
* NASA's Kennedy Space Center had its IT services, approximately 22,000 devices, outsourced in 1998 for $30 million a year on a 3-year contract.&lt;ref name="gaogov"&gt;{{cite web|title=DESKTOP OUTSOURCING: Positive Results Reported, but Analyses Could Be Strengthened|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/240/234095.pdf|website=gao.gov|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:east forum Berlin}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
Every year, the '''east forum Berlin''' brings together [[opinion leader]]s from the political and business worlds in the East and the West to discuss challenges and [[Business opportunity|opportunities]] faced by the economic area from Lisbon to Vladivostok and beyond. It was founded in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = east forum Berlin schafft neue Plattform für europäische Wirtschaftsdebatten|url = https://www.berlin.de/sen/wirtschaft/presse/pressemitteilungen/2013/pressemitteilung.146793.php|website = www.berlin.de|date = 2014-07-12|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Beratergruppe Ukraine  {{!}} Präsentation beim 2. east forum Berlin  „Eastern Partnership countries between East and West: Perspectives and challenges“|url = http://www.beratergruppe-ukraine.de/wordpress/de/praesentation-beim-2-east-forum-berlin-eastern-partnership-countries-between-east-and-west-perspectives-and-challenges/|website = www.beratergruppe-ukraine.de|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The overall aim of the east forum Berlin is to facilitate dialogue in order to overcome barriers for prosperity, to exchange know-how and intensify networks. In addition, this international event is an opportunity to present Berlin as a vibrant location of political and economic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Georgia participates in 3rd East Forum Berlin 2015|url = http://agenda.ge/news/33755/eng|website = agenda.ge|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
east forum Berlin 2016 took place during Germany's [[OSCE]] Chairmanship&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osce.org/cio&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle of new deadlocks and new dynamics that characterise the transforming economic and political realities in the region from Europe to Asia. The two opposing trends are embedded in new division lines leading to an unfamiliar status quo of alienation. Secondly, they are surrounded by recently formed alliances consisting of as yet poorly known stakeholders, which create new spheres of influence. These dynamics offer potential for [[economic growth|growth]] but also involve geopolitical and geo-economic challenges for all stakeholders in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11410">'''Employee scheduling software''' automates the process of creating and maintaining a [[Schedule (workplace)|schedule]]. Automating the scheduling of employees increases productivity and makes many secretarial and manual scheduling positions obsolete. Such software will usually track [[vacation time]], [[sick time]], compensation time, and alert when there are conflicts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattie|first=Maes|year=2000|title=Agents that Reduce Work and Information Overload|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/716f/f491fe8be17d8b4cb35bd9c5cfcee948e88a.pdf|journal=MIT Media Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As scheduling data is accumulated over time, it may be extracted for payroll or to analyze past activity. Although employee scheduling software may or may not make optimization decisions, it does manage and coordinate the tasks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernst|first=A.

Mobile scheduling further increased scheduling productivity and eliminated inefficient scheduling steps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Purpose==
A theoretical underpinning of an employee scheduling problem can be represented as the [[Nurse scheduling problem]], which is [[NP-hard]]. The theoretical complexity of the problem is a significant factor in the development of various software solutions. This is because systems must take into account many different forms of schedules that could be worked, and allocate employees to the correct schedule.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Weber, N., &amp; Patten, L. (2005). Shoring Up for Efficiency. ''Health Management Technology, 26'' (1), 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, optimization of scheduling is to minimize costs, but also often requires a reciprocal approach from management instead of complete reliance on software.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Transitioning to employee scheduling software ==
Prior to employee scheduling software companies would use physical mediums for tracking employee hours and work schedule. This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week.

===Punch cards===

The earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. [[Herman Hollerith]] improved the design.&lt;ref&gt;Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47–49. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.&lt;ref&gt;Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280577-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic tape===

During the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.&lt;ref&gt;Aspray (ed.), W. (1990). Computing before Computers. Iowa State University Press. p. 151. {{ISBN|0-8138-0047-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats.&lt;ref&gt;Lubar, Steven (1993). InfoCulture: The Smithsonian Book of Information Age Inventions. Houghton Mifflin. p. 302. {{ISBN|0-395-57042-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auto-Scheduling &amp; Intelligent Rostering===

In the 2010s, the wide adoption of mobile devices and the rise of 3G, 4G, and 5G networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emarketer.com/Article/eMarketer-Updates-Worldwide-Internet-Mobile-User-Figures/1015770|title=eMarketer Updates Worldwide Internet and Mobile User Figures - eMarketer|website=www.emarketer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide has made it possible to approach the task of scheduling differently. In the last decade, many software solutions have sprung up to make the lives of business owners and managers easier and less burdensome.

The first wave of solutions helped small business owners to schedule, manage, and communicate with their employees in a more streamlined way. The newer way of solutions go a step further, leveraging machine learning and are being built on even newer cloud technologies.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The need for automation and intelligent rostering in workforce management will continue to grow as society's heads into a gig economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy|title=The Future of Work: The Rise of the Gig Economy|website=NACo|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Complexity ==
Algorithms are used within the employee scheduling software in order to determine not only who is working, but also the specific jobs and tasks required of the workers. The system still must be monitored, and any further issues with assigning of specifics is done manually.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Robidoux, L. &amp; Donnelly, P. (2011). Automated employee scheduling: Welcome to the future. ''Nursing Management, 42'' (12), 41-43. doi: 10.1097/01.NUMA.0000407580.30932.ce&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of roster problems and models, there are three main factors to work out the differences: the integration of days off scheduling with line of work construction and task assignment, roster construction, and demand type.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These complexities thusly require that each and every workplace must optimize employee scheduling software based off their own unique set of rules, issues and needs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, it is difficult to determine optimal solution that minimize costs, meet employee preferences, distribute shifts equitably among employees and satisfy all the workplace constraints. In many organizations, the people involved in developing rosters need decisions support tools to help provide the right employees at the right time and the right cost while achieving a high level of employee satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to constant change within work environments, new models and algorithms must be created in order to allow for flexibility as needs and demands arise. For example, when a large number of new employees are hired, as in the total workforce is increased, the scheduling software likely will need to be updated in order to allow for such a change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Features==
Although employee scheduling software won't necessarily improve [[business practices]] by itself, it does automate typically tedious business administration. By providing management with large amounts of data, this software can assist management in making decisions and automatically create a work schedule that fits as many constraints as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/716f/f491fe8be17d8b4cb35bd9c5cfcee948e88a.pdf "Agents that Reduce Work and Information Overload"] (PDF). ''MIT Media Laboratory''.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the software may be a part of an [[ERP software|ERP package]] or other [[human resource management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Technology: Transforming Workforce Management|last=IDC|publisher=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workforce Scheduling 2011: Automation Drives Accuracy, Efficiency and Business Outcomes|last=Aberdeen Group|publisher=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Note: Mobile Technology Meets the Frontline Workforce|last=Nucleus Research|publisher=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some typical features include:

*[[Gantt chart]]
*Approve employee requests for time off
* Reduce unproductive workforce due to over scheduling&lt;ref name="NYT102812"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Part-Time Life, as Hours Shrink and Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/a-part-time-life-as-hours-shrink-and-shift-for-american-workers.html|accessdate=October 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2012|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use weather forecasts to predict staffing needs&lt;ref name="NYT102812" /&gt;
* Days off scheduling 
* Allow employees to swap shifts.
* Templates to roll out shift plans over medium term
* Interface to payroll and/or management accounting software&lt;ref name="workforceasset" /&gt;
* Ability to easily identify unassigned shifts.&lt;ref name="workforceasset"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disselkamp|first1=Lisa|title=Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=9781118420508}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ability to create reports for [[invoicing]] and payroll.&lt;ref name="workforceasset" /&gt;
* Manage the task of [[automation]] and [[data collection]].
* Workplace analysis&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, C. (1999). Retail Scheduling Systems Get Makeovers. ''Computerworld, 33''(2), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mobile application integration
* Interface agents&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Future trends ==
As the modern workplace becomes more complex, it is likely that rostering will need to be more flexible to cater to more individualistic preferences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artificial intelligence also looks to play a bigger role in scheduling software, requiring less oversight by management to correct issues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Engineering Economics''', previously known as '''engineering economy''', is a subset of [[economics]] concerned with the use and "...application of economic principles" &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the analysis of engineering decisions.&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as [[microeconomics]] in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Copied content from [[Microeconomics]]; see that page's history for attribution ...&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment.&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; But, it is also a simplified application of microeconomic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as [[statistics]], [[mathematics]] and [[cost accounting]]. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; 

[[Engineer]]s seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.
Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets''|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2193/mod_resource/content/0/LecturePresentation1.pdf|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. undergraduate [[civil engineering]] curricula, engineering economics is a required course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/civil/undergraduate Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering]. Retrieved 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topic on the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]ination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the [[Professional Engineering]] registration process.

Considering the [[time value of money]] is central to most engineering economic analyses.  [[Cash flow]]s are [[Discounting|''discounted'']] using an [[interest rate]], except in the most basic economic studies.

For each problem, there are usually many possible ''alternatives''. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the ''choice'', is the ''do nothing alternative''.  The ''opportunity cost'' of making one choice over another must also be considered.  There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed ''attributes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Economy'', 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

''Costs'' as well as ''revenues'' are considered, for each alternative, for an ''analysis period'' that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project.  The ''salvage value'' is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.

Some other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are [[inflation]], [[uncertainty]], replacements, [[depreciation]], [[resource depletion]], [[taxes]], [[tax credits]], [[accounting]], cost estimations, or [[Capital (economics)|capital financing]]. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of [[cost engineering]].

Since engineering is an important part of the [[manufacturing]] sector of the [[economy]], engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are:

* The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms;
* Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues;
* Engineering product markets and demand influences; and
* The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BE1v91Qlj64C&amp;dq=isbn:090632128X Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth &amp; Performance]'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd. Revised edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benefit–cost ratio]]

== Examples of Usage ==
Some examples of engineering economic problems range from value analysis to economic studies. Each of these is relevant in different situations, and most often used by engineers or project managers. For example, engineering economic analysis helps a company not only determine the difference between fixed and incremental costs of certain operations, but also calculates that cost, depending upon a number of variables. Further uses of engineering economics include:

* Value Analysis
* [[Linear programming|Linear Programming]]
* Critical Path Economy
* Interest and Money - Time Relationships
* Depreciation and Valuation
* Capital Budgeting
* Risk, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity Analysis
* Fixed, Incremental, and Sunk Costs
* Replacement Studies
* Minimum Cost Formulas
* Various Economic Studies in relation to both Public and Private Ventures

Each of the previous components of engineering economics is critical at certain junctures, depending on the situation, scale, and objective of the project at hand. Critical path economy, as an example, is necessary in most situations as it is the coordination and planning of material, labor, and capital movements in a specific project. The most critical of these "paths" are determined to be those that have affect upon the outcome both in time and cost. Therefore, the critical paths must be determined and closely monitored by engineers and managers alike. Engineering economics helps provide the Gantt charts and activity-event networks to ascertain the correct use of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;DeGarmo E., Canada J., Engineering Economy, fifth edition, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value Analysis ===
Proper value analysis finds its roots in the need for industrial engineers and managers to not only simplify and improve processes and systems, but also the logical simplification of the designs of those products and systems. Though not directly related to engineering economy, value analysis is nonetheless important, and allows engineers to properly manage new and existing systems/processes to make them more simple and save money and time. Further, value analysis helps combat common "roadblock excuses" that may trip up managers or engineers. Sayings such as "The customer wants it this way" are retorted by questions such as; has the customer been told of cheaper alternatives or methods? "If the product is changed, machines will be idle for lack of work" can be combated by; can management not find new and profitable uses for these machines? Questions like these are part of engineering economy, as they preface any real studies or analyses.  

=== Linear Programming ===
[[Linear programming]] is the use of mathematical methods to find optimized solutions, whether they be minimized or maximized in nature. This method uses a series of lines to create a polygon then to determine the largest, or smallest, point on that shape. Manufacturing operations often use linear programming to help mitigate costs and maximize profits or production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

=== Interest and Money - Time Relationships ===
Considering the prevalence of capital to be lent for a certain period of time, with the understanding that it will be returned to the investor, money-time relationships analyze the costs associated with these types of actions. Capital itself must be divided into two different categories, ''equity capital'' and ''debt capital''. Equity capital is money already at the disposal of the business, and mainly derived from profit, and therefore is not of much concern, as it has no owners that demand its return with interest. Debt capital does indeed have owners, and they require that its usage be returned with "profit", otherwise known as interest. The interest to be paid by the business is going to be an expense, while the capital lenders will take interest as a profit, which may confuse the situation. To add to this, each will change the income tax position of the participants. 

Interest and Money - Time Relationships comes into play when the capital required to complete a project must be either borrowed or derived from reserves. To borrow brings about the question of interest and value created by the completion of the project. While taking capital from reserves also denies its usage on other projects that may yield more results. [[Interest]] in the simplest terms is defined by the multiplication of the principle, the units of time, and the [[interest rate]]. The complexity of interest calculations, however, becomes much higher as factors such as compounding interest or [[Annuity|annuities]] come into play. 

=== Depreciation and Valuation ===
The fact that assets and material in the real world eventually wear down, and thence break, is a situation that must be accounted for. [[Depreciation]] itself is defined by the decreasing of value of any given asset, though some exceptions do exist. [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] can be considered the basis for depreciation in a basic sense, as any decrease in ''value'' would be based on an ''original value''. The idea and existence of depreciation becomes especially relevant to engineering and project management is the fact that capital equipment and assets used in operations will slowly decrease in worth, which will also coincide with an increase in the likelihood of machine failure. Hence the recording and calculation of depreciation is important for two major reasons. 

# To give an estimate of "recovery capital" that has been put back into the property.
# To enable depreciation to be charged against profits that, like other costs, can be used for income taxation purposes. 

Both of these reasons, however, cannot make up for the "fleeting" nature of depreciation, which make direct analysis somewhat difficult. To further add to the issues associated with depreciation, it must be broken down into three separate types, each having intricate calculations and implications. 

* Normal Depreciation, due to physical or functional losses.
* Price Depreciation, due to changes in market value.
* Depletion, due to the use of all available resources.

Calculation of depreciation also comes in a number of forms; ''straight line, declining balance, sum-of-the-year's,'' and ''service output''. The first method being perhaps the easiest to calculate, while the remaining have varying levels of difficulty and utility. Most situations faced by managers in regards to depreciation can be solved using any of these formulas, however, company policy or preference of individual may affect the choice of model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Capital Budgeting ===
[[Capital budgeting]], in relation to engineering economics, is the proper usage and utilization of capital to achieve project objectives. It can be fully defined by the statement; "... as the series of decisions by individuals and firms concerning how much and where resources will be obtained and expended to meet future objectives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition almost perfectly explains capital and its general relation to engineering, though some special cases may not lend themselves to such a concise explanation. The actual acquisition of that capital has many different routes, from equity to bonds to retained profits, each having unique strengths and weakness, especially when in relation to income taxation. Factors such as risk of capital loss, along with possible or expected returns must also be considered when capital budgeting is underway. For example, if a company has $20,000 to invest in a number of high, moderate, and low risk projects, the decision would depend upon how much risk the company is willing to take on, and if the returns offered by each category offset this perceived risk. Continuing with this example, if the high risk offered only 20% return, while the moderate offered 19% return, engineers and managers would most likely choose the moderate risk project, as its return is far more favorable for its category. The high risk project failed to offer proper returns to warrant its risk status. A more difficult decision may be between a moderate risk offering 15% while a low risk offering 11% return. The decision here would be much more subject to factors such as company policy, extra available capital, and possible investors. &lt;blockquote&gt;"In general, the firm should estimate the project opportunities, including investment requirements and prospective rates of return for each, expected to be available for the coming period. Then the available capital should be tentatively allocated to the most favorable projects. The lowest prospective rate of return within the capital available then becomes the minimum acceptable rate of return for analyses of any projects during that period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Economy|last=DeGarmo|first=E. Paul|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=209-210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Minimum Cost Formulas ===
Being one of the most important and integral operations in the engineering economic field is the minimization of cost in systems and processes. Time, resources, labor, and capital must all be minimized when placed into any system, so that revenue, product, and profit can be maximized. Hence, the general equation;

&lt;math&gt;C=ax +b/x+k&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is total cost, ''a b'' and ''k'' are constants, and ''x'' is the variable number of units produced.  

There are a great number of cost analysis formulas, each for particular situations and are warranted by the policies of the company in question, or the preferences of the engineer at hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Economic Studies, both Private and Public in Nature ===
Economic studies, which are much more common outside of engineering economics, are still used from time to time to determine feasibility and utility of certain projects. They do not, however, truly reflect the "common notion" of economic studies, which is fixated upon macroeconomics, something engineers have little interaction with. Therefore, the studies conducted in engineering economics are for specific companies and limited projects inside those companies. At most one may expect to find some feasibility studies done by private firms for the government or another business, but these again are in stark contrast to the overarching nature of true economic studies. Studies have a number of major steps that can be applied to almost every type of situation, those being as follows;

* Planning and Screening - Mainly reviewing objectives and issues that may be encountered.
* Reference to Standard Economic Studies - Consultation of standard forms.
* Estimating - Speculating as to the magnitude of costs and other variables.
* Reliability - The ability to properly estimate.
* Comparison between Actual and Projected Performance - Verify savings, review failures, to ensure that proposals were valid, and to add to future studies.
* Objectivity of the Analyst - To ensure the individual that advanced proposals or conducted analysis was not biased toward certain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Enrolled agent''' (or '''EA''') is a [[tax advisor]] who is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Enrolled agents represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) for tax issues including audits, collections and appeals.

Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].&lt;/ref&gt; The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. [[Attorneys in the United States|Attorneys]] and [[Certified Public Accountant|certified public accountants]] (CPAs) are licensed on a state by state basis, and are also empowered by the Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Enrolled Agents, "What Is An Enrolled Agent?"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, there are approximately 53,000 practicing EAs in the United States.

==History==
The position of enrolled agent was created as a reaction to fraudulent war loss claims in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] with roots tracing back to the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884,&lt;ref&gt;In section 3 of the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884, under the heading “War Department,” Congress authorized appropriation of $125,787.03 for “horses and other property lost in the military service prior to July 1, 1881."&lt;/ref&gt; or General Deficiency Appropriation Bill (H.R. 2735), also known as the "Horse Act of 1884", which was signed into law by President [[Chester A. Arthur]] on July 7, 1884. After the Civil War, many citizens faced difficulties in settling claims with the government for property confiscated for use in the war effort. As a result, Congress endowed enrolled agents with the power of advocacy to prepare claims against the government. From 1884 through the early 20th century, this statute remained largely unchanged.

When the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] was passed, signed into law by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on October 3, 1913, the scope of the enrolled agent was expanded to include claims for monetary relief for citizens whose taxes had become inequitable.  As [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Estate tax in the United States|estate]], [[Gift tax in the United States|gift]] and other sources of tax collections became more complex, the role of the enrolled agent increased to include the preparation of the many tax forms that were required. As a result of this complexity, audits became more prevalent and the enrolled agent role evolved into taxpayer representation, promulgating a series of statutes which were combined into a single Treasury Department Circular in February 19, 1921, known as [[Circular 230]], to address "the laws and regulations governing the recognition of agents, attorneys, and other persons representing claimants before the Treasury Department and offices thereof."

==Becoming an enrolled agent==
To become an enrolled agent, an applicant must obtain a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number|PTIN]] and achieve passing scores on all three parts of the [[Special Enrollment Examination]], which covers many aspects of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to income, estate, gift, employment, or excise taxes. A [[background check]], including a review of the applicant’s personal and business tax compliance,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael R., Deputy Inspector General for Audit, Office of Professional Responsibility, Memorandum 2006-10-170. [http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200610170fr.html].&lt;/ref&gt; is conducted after an applicant files Form 23, ''Application for Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within one year of completing all three parts of the examination.

==Maintaining enrolled agent status==

===Renewal for active enrolled agents===
To qualify for renewal as an enrolled agent, an individual must complete 72 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every three years, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each of the three years.&lt;ref name="seq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sequoiacpe.com/ea-cpe-requirements|title=Enrolled Agent CPE Requirements|publisher=SequoiaCPE|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent overloading of CPEs in any year of an enrollment cycle, the IRS requires a minimum of 16 hours of CPE every year.&lt;ref name="CPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypescpe.com/CPE-Self-Study-CPE-for-Accounting-Audit-Ethics-Tax-CFPs-Etc.cmc?&amp;view=4E|title=EA CPE Requirements|publisher=www.mypescpe.com|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Individuals must renew their PTIN between October 16 and December 31 of each year.

Individuals must file Form 8554, ''Application for Renewal of Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service'', within the applicable renewal period.

Renewal periods are based on the last digit of an enrolled agent's [[Social Security number]] (SSN)&lt;ref name="CPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seq"/&gt; or [[Tax Identification Number|tax identification number]]:

|}

===Renewal after initial enrollment cycle===
Individuals admitted to practice at any time during an enrollment cycle, "the three successive enrollment years preceding the effective date of renewal,"&lt;ref&gt;TreasuryDepartment Circular No. 230 § 10.6(e)(1)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; must complete two hours of continuing professional education for each month of enrollment, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each year. If an individual receives initial enrollment between November 1 and April 1 of their applicable renewal period, they will not be required to renew until the expiration of the first full three-year enrollment cycle following their initial enrollment.

===Failure to renew===
An individual who has not filed a timely application for renewal, who has not made a timely response to the notice of noncompliance, or who has not satisfied the requirements of eligibility for renewal, will be placed on a roster of inactive enrolled individuals. During this time, the individual will be ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and may not state or imply that they are eligible to represent taxpayers, use the term enrolled agent, or use the EA designation.

==Practice before the IRS: Enrolled agents and other practitioners==
The right to practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by Federal statute,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|330}} and {{usc|5|500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and persons authorized to practice are known as "Federally Authorized Tax Practitioners",&lt;ref&gt;See also {{usc|26|7525(a)(3)(A)}}, relating to confidentiality of communications.&lt;/ref&gt; or "FATPs". The FATP status is granted to attorneys, [[Certified Public Accountants|certified public accountants]], and enrolled agents, each having unlimited representation rights before the Internal Revenue Service. These practitioners may represent their clients on any matters including audits, collection actions, payment issues, tax refund matters, and appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Service, "[https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Understanding-Tax-Return-Preparer-Credentials Understanding Tax Return Preparer Credentials]"&lt;/ref&gt; FATP status is also granted with limited representation rights to [[Enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]], enrolled retirement plan agents, and [[Registered Tax Return Preparer|registered tax return preparers]].

Enrolled agents, like other FATPs, are subject to a set of procedures and regulations described in Treasury Department Circular No. 230,'' Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When practicing before the Internal Revenue Service, enrolled agents may not use the term "certified" in describing their professional designation. An enrolled agent admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that an employer/employee relationship exists between the enrolled agent and the Internal Revenue Service.

==Practice in federal courts==
Enrolled agent status does not authorize the enrollee to practice before the [[United States Tax Court]] or in any other court.

Practice in U.S. Tax Court is limited to members of the Bar of the Court. The Internal Revenue Code states, "No qualified person shall be denied admission to practice before the Tax Court because of his failure to be a member of any profession or calling."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7452}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-attorneys must pass a Tax Court exam for admission to the Bar of the Court. Attorneys are admitted to the Bar of the Tax Court without having to take the Tax Court examination.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Rule 200, Rules of Practice and Procedure, United States Tax Court (eff. July 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Practice in other federal courts is generally limited to persons licensed as attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Rule 5, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective July 1, 2013; Rule 46, Rules and Internal Operating Procedures of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (May 2016); Attorney Admissions Requirements, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geo-Enable''' is a [[neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Geospatial]] or [[Geographic]] and [[Enablement (disambiguation)|Enablement]]. Associated words include Geo-Enablment and Geo-Enabling.

As a verb it is increasingly used in the fields of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS), Web Development, Mobility, [[Information Management]] (IM) and [[Information technology|IT]]. Similar to the terms 'Web-Enabled' or 'GPS-Enabled' - 'Geo-Enable' suggests the application of location or geospatial information as part of business processes or using 'location intelligence' to augment non-spatial [[information systems]] and/or [[Business Intelligence]] (BI).

Geospatial Enablement can be thought of as the integrated use of Geographic Information, as opposed to using Geographic Information within a geographic and technology-centric environment of something such as a [[GPS]] or GIS.

A definition given by GeoEnable Ltd is:

'Geo-Enablement n.:
1. Embedding and leveraging the power of location and geography within workflows and business processes.
2. The act of deriving and utilising geography within non-spatial information.
3. The state of being enabled using location information.' &lt;ref name="Geo-Enablement"&gt;GeoEnable. ''What is Geo-Enablement?'' GeoEnable Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by the US Government is:

'To geo-enable is to apply geospatial capabilities to a business process in order to establish the authoritative spatial location of business data, and enable contextual spatial analysis.' &lt;ref name="GeospatialPlatform2010"&gt;US Government. ''Modernization Roadmap for the Geospatial Platform (Version 4.0)''. US Department of the Interior &amp; Federal Geographic Data Committee, March 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
The '''Global Learning Opportunities in Business Education''' ('''GLOBE''') program is an undergraduate business program that sends 54 elite students to study at [[Copenhagen Business School]] (CBS) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) in [[Hong Kong]], and the [[Kenan–Flagler Business School]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina| Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States]]. 

At each respective university, eighteen students are selected based on their academic achievements, personalities, and previous life experiences. After being selected, the students spend a year and a half traveling the world, networking internationally, and gaining a new perspective on the business world. During the first year of the program, students study at CBS in the fall and CUHK in the spring. Following the semester in Hong Kong, students generally pursue competitive internships with companies throughout the world. The final semester is then spent at the University of North Carolina. Following completion of the program, students return to their respective universities, where they spend one final semester completing their degree.

As of September 2017, 10 batches of GLOBE students have graduated the program. Batch 11 is in the midst of its third and final semester while batch 12 is in its first.

== Ranking and reputation ==
The GLOBE program combines international business studies with real-life international experience, giving GLOBE Scholars unique perspectives in their future business endeavors. At CBS, only students majoring in International Business are eligible for program admission. At UNC, sophomores apply for the GLOBE program when applying to the Kenan-Flagler Business School. At CUHK, only students majoring in Global Business Studies, one of the most competitive undergraduate programs in Hong Kong, are eligible to apply. At each university, the GLOBE administration team selects students through a rigorous application and extensive interview process to maximize student and program compatibility.

The three universities at which GLOBE students study all receive top rankings on their respective continents. In 2012, CUHK was ranked fifth in Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2012|title=QS University Rankings: Asia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS was ranked as the third-best international business school in the world after Harvard and London Business School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109113010/http://uk.cbs.dk/about_cbs_campus/quality/accreditation_ranking |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kenan-Flagler Business School at UNC was ranked sixth-best business school in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|title=HTML 404 - Page Not Found|website=www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206124015/http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Programs/BSBA/careerServices/rank.cfm|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
During the course of the program all the GLOBE students live and study together. Students also take the opportunity to travel extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States.

== Study trips ==
The third batch (graduated December 9, 2009) visited Brussels, Berlin, Shanghai, Tokyo, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and New York City on its study trips. The students visited companies such as Deutsche Bahn in Berlin, Toyota City in Japan, and Standard &amp; Poor's in New York City.
Batch eight (graduating December 14, 2014) has visited Brussels and Berlin, and 10 days are going to be spent in Indonesia visiting and solving local company issues. In the US, there will be a study trip to Research Triangle Park and a more extensive one in the late fall.

== Media coverage ==
Although still a young program, the GLOBE program has been featured in numerous major business publications around the world. The program was referenced in an article about students' perceptions of companies in the ''Financial Times'' and ''BusinessWeek''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/nov2009/bs2009116_361652.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The program has also been the focus of articles in business media such as the Danish newspaper ''Børsen''.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.cbs.dk/uddannelser/bachelor/bacheloruddannelser/bsc_in_international_business/hoejreboks/nyheder/globe_delivers_says_danish_business_daily/(language)/eng-GB&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlingske Business (Danish newspaper) ran a series of articles about the program in the fall, 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.business.dk/?article=27332801-Fremtidens-globale-topledere-er-samlet-paa-CBS|title=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk|website=Berlingske Business - Seneste nyheder fra erhvervslivet på business.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP),''' a term created by [[Gartner]] Inc. – an information technology research and advisory company. As defined by Gartner: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging application architecture that "breaks the wall" between transaction processing and analytics. It enables more informed and "in business real time" decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3599217/market-guide-htapenabling-inmemory-computing|title=Market Guide for HTAP-Enabling In-Memory Computing Technologies|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2657815/hybrid-transactionanalytical-processing-foster-opportunities|title=Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing Will Foster Opportunities for Dramatic Business Innovation|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
In the 1960s, computer use in the [[business sector]] began with payroll transactions and later included tasks in areas such as accounting and billing. At that time, users entered data, and the system [[batch processing|processed it at a later time]]. Further development of instantaneous data processing, or [[online transaction processing]] (OLTP), led to widespread OLTP use in government and business-sector information systems.&lt;ref name=Bog&gt;
Bog, Anja. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0NAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=hybrid+transactional/analytical+processing&amp;sou#v=onepage&amp;q=hybrid%20transactional%2Fanalytical%20processing&amp;f=false ''Benchmarking Transaction and Analytical Processing Systems: The Creation of a Mixed Workload Benchmark and Its Application''] Springer-Verlage Berlin Heidelberg. 2014
&lt;/ref&gt;

OLAP covers the analytical processing involved in creating, synthesizing, and managing data. With greater data demands among businesses,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} OLAP also has evolved. To meet the needs of applications, both technologies are dependent on their own systems and distinct architectures.&lt;ref name="Pezzini"&gt;Pezzini, Massimo; Feinberg, Donald; Rayner, Nigel; Edjlali, Roxane. [https://www.gartner.com/doc/2657815/hybrid-transactionanalytical-processing-foster-opportunities "Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing Will Foster Opportunities for Dramatic Business Innovation."] Gartner. 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bog /&gt; As a result of the complexity in the information architecture and infrastructure of both OLTP and OLAP systems, data analysis is delayed.&lt;ref name=Pezzini /&gt;{{qn|date=November 2016}}

==HTAP advantages and challenges==
There are various interpretations of HTAP other than Gartner's original definition; an "emerging architecture". These interpretations suggest different advantages, one being a database functionality. Recent advances in research, hardware, OLTP and OLAP capabilities, in-memory technologies, scalable transactional management and products enable transactional processing and analytics, or HTAP, to operate on the same database.&lt;ref name=Pezzini /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolpe"&gt;Wolpe, Toby. [http://www.zdnet.com/sql-and-nosql-fine-but-how-does-the-hybrid-database-fit-in-7000029277 "SQL and NoSQL? Fine, but how does the hybrid database fit in?"] ZDNet. 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bog /&gt;

However, Gartner's most recent reports suggest broader advantages than a single unified database can offer. Traditional application architectures separated transactional and analytical systems. Digital business, and the need to respond to business moments, means that using "after the fact" analysis is no longer adequate. Business moments are transient opportunities that must be exploited in real time. If an organization is unable to recognize and/or respond quickly to a business moment by taking fast and well-informed decisions, then some other organization will, resulting in a missed opportunity (or a new business threat). HTAP allows advanced analytics to be run in real time on "in flight" transaction data, providing an architecture that empowers users to respond more effectively to business moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3352419/enable-digital-business-innovation-hybrid|title=How to Enable Digital Business Innovation via Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main technical challenges for an HTAP database are how to be efficient both for operational (many small transactions with a high fraction of updates) and analytical workloads (large and complex queries traversing large number of rows) on the same database system and how to prevent the interference of the analytical queries over the operational workload.

HTAP solves the issue of analytic latency in several ways, including eliminating the need for multiple copies of the same data and the requirement for data to be offloaded from [[operational database]]s to [[data warehouse]]s via [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] processes.&lt;ref name="Pezzini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt;

Most HTAP applications has been enabled by in-memory technologies that can process a high volume of transactions and offer features such as forecasting and simulations. New HTAP technologies bring scalable transactional processing and do not need to rely on keeping the whole database in-memory. HTAP has the potential to change the way organizations do business by offering immediate business decision-making capabilities based on live and sophisticated analytics of large volumes of data. Government and business leaders can be informed of real-time issues, outcomes, and trends that necessitate action, such as in the areas of public safety, risk management, and fraud detection.

An '''inside director''' is a member of the [[board of directors]] of a [[corporation]] who is also a member of the corporation's [[management]], almost always a [[corporate officer]]. For example, a [[chief executive officer]] who is also [[Chair (official)|chairman of the board]] would be considered an inside director. A [[chief financial officer]], [[executive vice president]], or other corporate executive who is a member of the board is also an inside director. Inside directors commonly enjoy seats on boards because they own [[Ownership equity|equity]] in the company.

Inside directors are differentiated from [[outside director]]s, who do not hold a management position in the corporation which the board governs.

An '''intelligence engine''' is a type of [[enterprise information management]] that combines [[Business rule management system|business rule management]], [[predictive analytics|predictive]], and [[prescriptive analytics]] to form a unified information-access platform that provides real-time intelligence through [[Web search engine|search technologies]], [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] and/or existing business infrastructure.  Intelligence Engines are process and/or business problem specific, resulting in industry and/or function-specific marketing trademarks associated with them.  They can be differentiated from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software in that intelligence engines include organization-level business rules and proactive [[decision management]] functionality.

==History==
The first intelligence engine application appears to have been introduced in 2001 by [[Sonus Networks|Sonus Networks, Inc.]] in their patent US6961334 B1.&lt;ref name="sonus"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6961334 | status = patent | title = Intelligence engine | gdate = 2005-11-01 | invent1 = Kaczmarczyk, Casimer M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the field of telecommunications systems, the intelligence engine was composed of a database queried by a data distributor layer, received by a telephony management layer and acted upon by a facility management command &amp; control layer.&lt;ref name="sonus" /&gt; This combined standalone business intelligence tools like a [[data warehouse]], reporting and querying software and a [[decision support system]].

The concept was reinforced in 2002 in patent application US20030236689 A1&lt;ref name="2002patent"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 20030236689 | status = application | title = Analyzing decision points in business processes | pubdate = 2003-12-25 | invent1 = Casati, Fabio | invent2 = Sayal, Mehmet | invent3 = Guadalupe Castellanos, Maria | invent4 = Gunopulos, Dimitrios | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2003236689&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; which applied predictive quantitative models to data and used rules to correlate context data at different stages of the business process with business process outcomes to be presented to end users.&lt;ref name="2002patent" /&gt;

[[LogRhythm|LogRhythm Inc.]] advanced the concept in 2010 by adding event managers to the end of the intelligence engine's process to determine reporting, remediation and other outcomes.&lt;ref name="LogRhythm"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 2012131185 | status = application | title = Advanced Intelligence Engine | pubdate = 2012-05-24 | invent1 = Petersen , Chris | invent2 = Villella, Phillip | invent3 = Aisa, Brad | url = https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2012131185A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, professional service company [[KPMG]] continued to advance the concept by commercializing intelligence engines with the introduction of Third Party Intelligence, which is differentiated from past intelligence engines in its increased use of embedded intellectual property, diversity of global data inputs and focus on predictive analytics to mitigate risk and yield cost savings.&lt;ref name="CIOReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cioreview.com/news/kmpg-launches-third-party-intelligence-intelligence-engine-to-anticipate-thirdparty-disruptions-nid-14407-cid-78.html |title=KMPG Launches Third Party Intelligence: Intelligence Engine to Anticipate Third-party Disruptions|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits==
As a system that combines human intelligence, data inputs, automated decision-making and unified information access, intelligence engines are an advancement in business intelligence tools because they: 
* integrate structured data and unstructured content in a single index&lt;ref name="itbiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/it-unmasked/attivio-applies-predictive-analytics-to-indexed-data.html |title=Attivio Applies Predictive Analytics to Indexed Data |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KXEN''' was an American [[software company]] which existed from 1998 to 2013 when it was acquired by [[SAP AG]].

==History==
KXEN was founded in June 1998 by Roger Haddad and Michel Bera, based on an original idea from [[Léon Bottou]] using [[Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory]] on [[structural risk minimization]]. Erik Marcadé joined as chief technical officer in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kxen  CrunchBase KXEN]. October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] with offices in Paris and London. On September 10, 2013 SAP AG announced plans to acquire KXEN.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sap.com/news-reader/index.epx?pressid=21521  SAP Extends the Power of Predictive Analytics to Unlock Big Data With Acquisition of KXEN]". September 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kanaracus, September 10, 2013, PC World. "[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2048486/sap-buying-kxen-for-predictive-analytics.html  SAP buying KXEN for predictive analytics]".&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 1, 2013, a letter to KXEN customers announced the acquisition closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kxen.com/SAP-Customer-Letter|SAP Acquires KXEN, Inc. - A Letter to Our Customers]. October 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

KXEN primarily marketed [[predictive analytics]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner|first=Rochelle|title=KXEN: Predictive Analytics Made Easy|url=http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/171203310/kxen-predictive-analytics-made-easy.htm;jsessionid=vygKArOtFyp-8N5dI-hiuw**.ecappj02|publisher=CRN|accessdate=February 6, 2012|date=October 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictive analytics==
InfiniteInsight is a [[predictive modeling]] suite developed by KXEN that assists analytic professionals, and business executives to extract information from data. Among other functions, InfiniteInsight is used for variable importance, [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[Market segmentation|segmentation]], [[time series]], [[association rule learning|product recommendation]], as described and expressed by the [[Java Data Mining]] interface, and for [[social network analysis]]. InfiniteInsight allows prediction of a behavior or a value, the [[forecasting|forecast]] of a time series or the [[Market segment|understanding of a group of individuals with similar behavior]]. Advanced functions include behavioral modeling, exporting the model code into different target environments or building predictive models on top of [[SAS System|SAS]] or [[SPSS]] data files. Competitors are [[SAS (software)|SAS Enterprise Miner]], [[SPSS Modeler|IBM SPSS Modeler]], and [[Statistica]]. Open source predictive tools like the [[R (programming language)|R package]] or [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]] are also competitors, since they provide similar features free of charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18213">A '''marketing information system''' ('''MKIS''') is a [[management information system]] (MIS) designed to support [[marketing]] [[decision making]]. Jobber (2007) defines it as a "system in which marketing data is formally gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to [[management|manager]]s in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis." In addition, the online business dictionary defines Marketing Information System (MKIS) as "a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information, gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/marketing-information-system.html Marketing information system], Business Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, "an overall Marketing Information System can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular, planned collection, analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions." (Kotler, at al, 2006)

== Overview ==
Reid and Bojanic(2010) claimed that, " The term market research informs relatively narrowerly than Marketing Information System(MkIS) which is altered from the term management information [[systemization]]. Market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project; the major objective is a one-time use. "&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hospitality Marketing Management|last = Reid|first = Robert D.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780470088586|location = New Jersey|pages = 209|last2 = Bojanic|first2 = David C.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marketing information system, which continuously collects the initial, routine and systematic data, is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Importance ==
Developing a MKIS system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers.   Kotler, et al. (2006) defined it more broadly as "people, equipment, and procedures to gather, sort, analyze, evaluate, and distribute needed, timely, and accurate information to marketing decision makers."&lt;ref name="Kotler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |authorlink= Philip Kotler |author2=Keller, Kevin Lane |authorlink2=Kevin Lane Keller  |editor= |others= |title=Marketing Management |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 12 |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Pearson Education |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as an economy focuses on services, marketing is important to "monitor the marketing environment for changes in [[buyer behavior]] competition, technology, economic conditions, and government policies."&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Harmon. (2003). Marketing Information Systems. Encyclopedia of Information Systems, Vol. 3. Elsevier Science (USA), 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to "adapt to changes in the market environment." (Harmon, 2003)

As an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge, MkIS systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the [[value proposition]] that one organization provides with respect to another, as well as to define their [[competitive advantage]]. (Harmon, 2003)

The main benefit of MkIS systems is to integrate market-monitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on [[customer management]] applications with marketing [[decision support system]]s.  This area constitute [[Marketing intelligence]] that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches.

=== Relevance of MkIS ===
Shajahan and arya(2004) stated that, "Demands for the MkIS can be expressed by three crucial developments. Firstly, when companies expand and diversify into new markets, both the companies and customer's point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers. Therefore, there would be greater need for marketing information. Secondly, when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income, it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure. A full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers. This awareness is possible only with the help of a well- designed effective MkIS. Thirdly, the development of the markets and the movement from price to non-price grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them. Analyzing the needs for MkIS from a third person's angle, three more factors come to the forefront viz., the information explosion, increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments. " &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Information Systems|last = Shajahan|first = S.|publisher = New Page International(P) Ltd.|year = 2004|isbn = 8122415490|location = India|pages = 99|last2 = Priyadharshini|first2 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing Research(MR)and MkIS ===

In addition, "Great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves.  Though marketing research information can be generated by studies, which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather, integrate, process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources, including that from marketing research. The contrasting characteristics of MkIS and MR are presented in Table 5.1 as shown below:

The business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning, promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets. Thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise. Business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations' growth in the face of global competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Main Structure ==
According to Robert Jamon (2003), MkIS systems are decomposed on four components: (1) user interfaces, (2) application software, (3) databases, and (4) system support.   The following is a description of each one of these components.

1. [[User interfaces]]. The essential element of the MAkINAS is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information.  The design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make.

2. [[Application software]]. These are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect, analyze, and manage data for the purpose of developing the information necessary for marketing decisions.

3. [[Database marketing]]. A marketing database is a system in which marketing data files are organized and stored.

4. [[IBM System/34, 36 System Support Program|System support]]. This component consists of system managers who manage and maintain the system assets including software and hardware network, monitor its activities and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

Along with these components, MkIS systems include [[Marketing decision support system|Marketing Decision Support Systems]] (MDSS), which in turn rely on simple systems such as [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SPSS]], and on-line analytical tools that help collect data.  Data compiled for analysis is stored and processed from a [[data warehouse]], which is simply a [[Information repository|data repository]] system that helps store and further process data collected internally and externally. (Harmon, 2003)

=== Databases ===
From Pride and Ferrell (2010), "Internal database is a part of the most marketing information systems. In addition, it's relatively convenient for access and retrieve of information. A databases allow marketers to tap into an abundance of information useful in making marketing decisions: internal sales reports, newspaper articles, company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more, often accessed through a computer system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Pride|first = William M.|publisher = Cengage Learning,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780547167473|location = Canada|pages = 148|last2 = Ferrell|first2 = O.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal Data ====
In with Birn(2004), " internal data is a part of the data that is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system. Further more, managers regard this as a command to make effective operation.But getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used. The following internal operating data are essential:
* Sales data, presented in a graphic format, can provide regular sales trend information and highlight whether certain customer types need to be targeted or focused.
* Price information by product line, compare with competitors, can monitor market trends; analyzed by customer type, it can check price trends in customer groups.
* Stock level data and trends in key accounts or distributors, focusing on whether different outlets need support, provide market share information.
* Market support information, coordinating the effects of marketing promotions, through advertising, direct marketing, trade incentives, consumer competitions and so on, helps to determine whether decisions are being made effectively.
* Competitive information, reviewing competitors'  promotions and communications to see if the company is doing it better or worse than competitors, can improve market targeting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effective Use of Market Research: How to Drive and Focus Better Business Decisions|last = Birn|first = Robin|publisher = Kogan Page Limited|year = 2004|isbn = 074944200X|location = Great Britain|pages = 22|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental scanning ===
Sandhusen(2000) defined that, environmental scanning is a display of the nature of MIS processed. " It gives assistance for the marketers to develop the strategies, policies, plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Sandhusen|first = Richard L.|publisher = Barron's Educational Series|year = 2000|isbn = 9780764112775|location = Canada|pages = 165|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kotler's Model ===
According to Philip Kotler, the four components that comprise the MkIS system are Internal Reports (Records) System, Marketing Research System, Marketing Intelligence System, and Marketing Decision Support System

1.Internal Reports System: It records various data from different department of a company, which is regarded as a major source of information.

2.Marketing Intelligence System: It is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment, hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly.

3.Marketing Research System: It is used to collect primary and secondary data, and displays the results in forms of reports.

4.Marketing Decision Support System: Compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems, it focuses more on processing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/mis-marketing-information-system-with-diagram/48703/|title = MIS: Marketing Information System (With Diagram)|date = 2015|accessdate = 1 Nov 2015|website = YourArticleLibrary|publisher = |last = Jaideep|first = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages , Limitations &amp; Possible Risks ==

=== Advantages ===
Bhasin stated that,"With an increasingly competitive and expanding market, the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound. So they have to establish a Marketing Information system. There are several advantages of Marketing information systems

* '''Organized Data collection''' –  MkIS can help the managers to organize loads of data collected from the market, thus results in an increment in the productivity.
* '''A broad perspective''' –  With a proper MkIS in place, the organization can be tracked which can be used to analyze independent processes. This helps in establishing a broader perspective which helps us know which steps can be taken to facilitate improvement.
* '''Storage of Important Data''' – The storage of important data is essential in execution and thus proves again that MkIS is not important only for information but also for execution.
* '''Avoidance of Crisis''' – The best way to analyze a stock (share market) is to see its past performance. Top websites like moneycontrol thrive on MIS. Similarly MIS helps you keep tracks of margins and profits. With an amazing information system established, an organizations direction can be analysed and probably crises averted before they place. 
* '''Co-ordination''' –  Consumer durables and FMCG companies have huge number of processes which needs to be co-ordinated. These companies depend completely on MIS for the proper running of the organization.
* '''Analysis and Planning''' –  MkIS plays a crucial role in the planning process, considering the planning procedure requires information. For planning, the first thing which is needed is the organizations capabilities, then the business environment and finallycompetitor analysis. In a proper MkIS, all these are present by default and are continuously updated. Therefore, MkIS is very important for planning and analysis.
* '''Control''' –  Just like MkIS can help in a crisis, in normal times it provides control as you have information of the various processes going on and what is happening across the company."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/customer-profitablity-analysis-2/|title = 8 Advantages of Marketing Information Systems|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible risks ===
"Nevertheless, the collection of marketing information should obey a high-frequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market." The possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to Bhasin are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/mis-marketing-information-system/|title = MIS – Marketing information system|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opportunities may be missed.
* There may be a lack of awareness of environmental changes and competitors' actions.
* [[Data collection]] may be difficult to analyze over several time periods.
* Marketing plans and decisions may not be properly reviewed.
* Data collection may be disjointed.
* Previous studies may not be stored in an easy to use format.
* Time lags may result if a new study is required.
* Actions may be reactionary rather than anticipatory.

Maintenance, complexity and setting up a MkIS are one of the major hindrances to Marketing information systems. Furthermore, wrong information being fed in MkIS can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Kotler and Philip have said that "both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers, whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost. Simultaneously, a firm cannot find all the data required by itself, but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research. However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness.  Each primary data collection method – observational, survey, and experimental – has its own advantages and disadvantages. Similarly, each of the various research contact methods – mail, telephone, personal interview, and online – also has its own advantages and drawbacks." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Marketing|last = Kotler|first = Philip|publisher = Pearson Education,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780137006694|location = United States of America|pages = 153|last2 = Armstrong|first2 = Gary|edition = 13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rural Marketing Information System (RuMIS) ==
A RuMIS is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural goods and manufactured goods intended for sales in rural areas. RuMIS is required also by the agriculturists and farmers who have enormous decis!ion-making to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rural Marketing: Indian Perspective|last = Singh|first = Awadhesh Kumar|publisher = New Age International (P) Ltd.|year = 2005|isbn = 8122416837|location = India|pages = 114|last2 = Pandey|first2 = Satyaprakash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

==History==

Panaya was founded in 2006 as ''ChangeSoft Technologies'' by entrepreneur [[Yossi Cohen]] and is headquartered in [[Ra'anana, Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.menlopark.com/directory-listing/Panaya/331527 | title=Panaya in Menlo Park | publisher=Menlo Park | accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruptive technology revolves around the impact analyses of code change, applied in code comparison of [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems to help reduce the application life cycle cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country =US  | number =2009216712 | status =  | title =Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | pubdate =27 August 2009  | gdate =  | fdate =  | pridate =  | inventor =Cohen, Yossi; Cohen, Mati; Dor, Nurit; Weiss, Dror; Armoni, Roy | assign1 =  | assign2 =  | class = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first patent application was filed in 2008, followed by an extension in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20090827ptan20090216712.php | title=Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | publisher=Fresh Patents | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a continuation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20130214ptan20130041886.php | title=Methods for calculating a combined impact analysis repository | publisher=Fresh Patents | date=14 February 2013 | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, shares of [[Tamares Group]], a [[private equity]] investment firm based in [[Vaduz]], [[Liechtenstein]], were acquired by Panaya as part of fundraising round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tamares.com/portfolio/selected-investments-private/panaya | title=Panaya Portfolio | publisher=Tamares | accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">'''Process-centered design''' ('''PCD''') is a [[design|design methodology]], which proposes a business centric approach for designing [[user interfaces]]. Because of the multi-stage business analysis steps involved right from the beginning of the PCD life cycle, it is believed to achieve the highest levels of [[Business/IT alignment|business-IT alignment]] that is possible through UI.

== Purpose ==
This method is aimed at enterprise applications where there is a business process involved. Unlike content oriented systems such as websites or portals, enterprise applications are built to enable a company's business processes. Enterprise applications often have a clear business goal and a set of specific objectives like- improve [[Productivity|employee productivity]], increase [[Efficiency ratio|business performance]] by a certain percent, etc.

== Comparison between other popular UI design methods ==
Although there are proven UI design methodologies (like the most popular "[[user-centered design]]", which helps design highly Usable Interfaces), PCD differentiates itself by precisely catering to business process intensive software which has not been the case with other UI design methodologies.

== Process-UI alignment ==
Process-UI alignment is a component of PCD, which ensures tight alignment between the business process and the enterprise application being developed. &lt;ref name="aja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alignjournal.com/index.cfm?section=article&amp;aid=446|title=Process-User Interface Alignment: New Value From a New Level of Alignment|publisher=Align Journal|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; UI design activities are affected by PCD. 

For example: A [[call center]] software used by a [[customer support]] agent, if designed for high process-UI alignment will achieve tremendous agent productivity improvement and call center performance; which is not likely to be seen if it were designed only for user satisfaction, ease of use, etc.

'''Social BI''', or '''Social Business Intelligence''', refers to the creation, publishing and sharing of custom [[business analytics]] reports and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboard]]s by end users of ''[[Cloud computing|Cloud]]'' technologies.

Social or collaborative BI is the use of Enterprise 2.0 tools and practices with business intelligence outputs for the purpose of making collective decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/social-bi-for-intelligent-enterprise-2-0/ |title=Social BI for Intelligent Enterprise 2.0 |accessdate= 12 November 2014 |publisher= Forte Consultancy Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; First enabled by the rapid growth of [[social media]] networks in 2009, Social BI allows for the collaborative development of post user-generated analytics among [[business analyst]]s and data mining professionals.  This has removed previous barriers to [[business intelligence|self-service BI]] while still employing traditional analytics applications.

Social BI can also be interpreted as providing business intelligence based on social networks data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groupcharger.com/social-business-intelligence/ |title=1 Social Business Intelligence |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |publisher= GroupCharger}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company selling consumer electronics goods needs to know how people are responding to their latest advertisements or promotions. The reports and visualizations made using social media represent what people are talking about in real time. Pulling data from different social media and preparing understandable reports will help company to decide upon further steps. These dashboards, [[Computer graphics|visualizations]], reports based on social media will be of help for companies to get efficient feedback and act accordingly.

==History==
On September 13, 2011, [[Dachis Group]] introduced the Social Business Index to provide some insights into how ‘social’ companies are, and how they stack up against similar corporations in their respective industries and their competitors, and provide some ‘social business’ benchmarks by company, subsidiary, geography, department and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/dachis-group-debuts-social-business-index-think-of-it-as-klout-for-companies/ |title=2 Dachis Group Debuts ‘Social Business Index’ – Think Of It As Klout For Companies |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |author= Robin Wauters |date= 2011-09-13 |work= |publisher= Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">'''Sourcing advisory''' is the use of third-party (external entity) advice during the sourcing process. As such, it may refer to advice sought during [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]] or [[global sourcing]].

==Sourcing advisors==
Given the strategic nature of the advisory and the prevalence of [[Global sourcing|sourcing]] amongst global organizations, most [[management consulting]] firms today offer sourcing advisory services. In addition, there exist a host of specialized sourcing adivsory firms that focus on providing sourcing advisory and research inputs to the industry. Sourcing advisors can also be independent freelance consultants.

In recent years software tools to automate sourcing advisory emerged. Building on [[Software as a Service]] (SaaS), the trade mark "Sourcing Advisory as a Service" (SAaaS) is used in the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plixos.com/en/it-outsourcing-services/saaas-sourcing-advisory-as-a-service "SAaaS - Automation in Sourcing Advisory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The range of services provided by sourcing advisory firms include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globusresearch.com/services-sourcing.aspx Services Sourcing: Outsourcing and Offshoring (www.globusresearch.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stock Market Learning rgb 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Stock Market Learning - Logo]]
'''Stock Market Learning''' is an international competition run by the [[Savings bank|Savings Banks]] in Europe with the support of the [[European Savings Banks Group]] (ESBG) based in Brussels. It aims to provide pupils a better understanding of the [[stock market]] and of the economic and financial world by simulating transactions in [[stock exchange]]s.  The competition was held for the first time in Germany in 1983, while the Savings Banks in Europe became actively involved in 1999. By 2010, over 1 million teams had taken part in the initiative.

==Procedure==
Each team is assigned an account with virtual capital that is to be used to buy and sell [[Security (finance)|securities]]. The purpose is to increase initial [[asset]]s by conducting individual investing strategies. While capital is virtual, trading is based on real [[Share price|stock prices]] at certain stock exchanges.

The list of tradable securities consists primarily of [[Share (finance)|shares]] but also includes [[Fixed interest|fixed-interests]] securities and [[Collective investment scheme|investment funds]]. Since 2009, there is both a conventional and [[sustainability]] competition. The former takes into consideration the total performance of the account, whereas the latter is based on the sustainability account value, i.e. on the earnings gained from shares listed in a [[sustainability index]].

==Awards==
In 2010, Stock Market Learning received the official [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade Project of Education for Sustainable Development]] award from the German Commission for UNESCO.

{{Strategy}}
'''Strategic planning ''' is an [[organization]]'s [[business process|process]] of defining its [[strategy]], or direction, and making [[decision making|decisions]] on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, J.M., 2018. Strategic planning for public and nonprofit organizations: A guide to strengthening and sustaining organizational achievement. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;. It may also extend to control mechanisms for guiding the implementation of the strategy.  Strategic planning became prominent in corporations during the 1960s and remains an important aspect of [[strategic management]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .
&lt;/ref&gt;. It is executed by strategic planners or [[strategist]]s, who involve many parties and research sources in their analysis of the organization and its relationship to the environment in which it competes.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Mintzberg 
| first = Henry
| author-link = Henry Mintzberg
| last2 = Quinn
| first2 = James B.
| year = 1996
| title = The Strategy Process: Concepts, Contexts, Cases | publisher = Prentice Hall
| isbn = 978-0-132-340304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy has many definitions, but generally involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). The senior leadership of an organization is generally tasked with determining strategy.  Strategy can be planned (intended) or can be observed as a pattern of activity (emergent) as the organization adapts to its environment or competes.

Strategy includes processes of formulation and implementation; strategic planning helps coordinate both.  However, strategic planning is analytical in nature (i.e., it involves "finding the dots"); strategy formation itself involves synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") via [[strategic thinking]]. As such, strategic planning occurs around the strategy formation activity.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Strategic Management Framework.png|thumb|300px|Strategic management processes and activities]]

===Overview===
Strategic planning is a process and thus has inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes. This process, like all processes, has constraints. It may be formal or informal and is typically iterative, with feedback loops throughout the process. Some elements of the process may be continuous and others may be executed as discrete projects with a definitive start and end during a period. Strategic planning provides inputs for [[strategic thinking]], which guides the actual strategy formation.  The end result is the organization's strategy, including a diagnosis of the environment and competitive situation, a guiding policy on what the organization intends to accomplish, and key initiatives or action plans for achieving the guiding policy.  &lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Rumelt
| first = Richard P.
| year = 2011
| title = Good Strategy / Bad Strategy | publisher = Crown Business
| isbn = 978-0-307-88623-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board); 
#Industry opportunities and threats; and
#Broader societal expectations.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Porter
| first = Michael E.
| authorlink = Michael Porter
| year = 1980
| title = [[Competitive Strategy]] | publisher = Free Press
| isbn = 0-684-84148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;  These elements are considered throughout the strategic planning process.

===Inputs===
Data is gathered from a variety of sources, such as interviews with key executives, review of publicly available documents on the competition or market, primary research (e.g., visiting or observing competitor places of business or comparing prices), industry studies, etc.  This may be part of a [[competitive intelligence]] program. Inputs are gathered to help support an understanding of the competitive environment and its opportunities and risks. Other inputs include an understanding of the values of key stakeholders, such as the board, shareholders, and senior management. These values may be captured in an organization's [[vision statement|vision]] and [[mission statement|mission]] statements.

===Activities===
{{quote box|width = 300px|quote=The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.|source=[[Michael Porter]]&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;}}
Strategic planning activities include meetings and other communication among the organization's leaders and personnel to develop a common understanding regarding the competitive environment and what the organization's response to that environment (its strategy) should be. A variety of strategic planning tools (described in the section below) may be completed as part of strategic planning activities.

The organization's leaders may have a series of questions they want answered in formulating the strategy and gathering inputs, such as: 
*What is the organization's business or interest?
*What is considered "value" to the customer or constituency?
*Which products and services should be included or excluded from the portfolio of offerings?
*What is the geographic scope of the organization?
*What differentiates the organization from its competitors in the eyes of customers and other stakeholders?
*Which skills and resources should be developed within the organization?&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Drucker
| first = Peter
| authorlink = Peter Drucker
| year = 1954
| title = The Practice of Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Row
| isbn = 0-06-091316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outputs===
The output of strategic planning includes documentation and communication describing the organization's strategy and how it should be implemented, sometimes referred to as the strategic plan. The strategy may include a diagnosis of the competitive situation, a guiding policy for achieving the organization's goals, and specific action plans to be implemented.&lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"/&gt;  A strategic plan may cover multiple years and be updated periodically.

The organization may use a variety of methods of measuring and monitoring progress towards the objectives and measures established, such as a [[balanced scorecard]] or [[strategy map]].  Companies may also plan their financial statements (i.e., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows) for several years when developing their strategic plan, as part of the goal setting activity. The term operational [[budget]] is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for the upcoming year. Capital budgets very often form the backbone of a strategic plan, especially as it increasingly relates to Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

===Outcomes===
Whilst the planning process produces outputs, as described above, [[strategy implementation]] or execution of the strategic plan produces Outcomes. These outcomes will invariably differ from the strategic goals. How close they are to the strategic goals and vision will determine the success or failure of the strategic plan. There will also arise unintended Outcomes, which need to be attended to and understood for strategy development and execution to be a true learning process.

== Tools and approaches ==
[[File:Wikimedia Strategic Plan.ogv|thumb|Video explaining the strategic plan of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]]]
[[File:WMF StrategicPlan2011 spreads.pdf|thumb|Wikimedia Movement Strategic Plan (PDF)]]

A variety of analytical tools and techniques are used in strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt; These were developed by companies and management consulting firms to help provide a framework for strategic planning. Such tools include:
* [[PEST analysis]], which covers the remote external environment elements such as political, economic, social and technological (PESTLE adds legal/regulatory and ecological/environmental); 
* [[Scenario planning]], which was originally used in the military and recently used by large corporations to analyze future scenarios;
* [[Porter five forces analysis]], which addresses industry attractiveness and rivalry through the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the threat of substitute products and new market entrants;
* [[SWOT analysis]], which addresses internal strengths and weaknesses relative to the external opportunities and threats; 
* [[Growth-share matrix]], which involves portfolio decisions about which businesses to retain or divest; and
* [[Balanced Scorecard]]s and [[strategy maps]], which creates a systematic framework for measuring and controlling strategy.
*[[Responsive evaluation|Responsive Evaluation]], which uses a constructivist evaluation approach to identify the outcomes of objectives, which then supports future strategic planning exercises.

==Strategic planning vs. financial planning==
Simply extending financial statement projections into the future without consideration of the competitive environment is a form of financial planning or budgeting, not strategic planning. In business, the term "financial plan" is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for future periods. The term "budget" is used for a financial plan for the upcoming year. A "forecast" is typically a combination of actual performance year-to-date plus expected performance for the remainder of the year, so is generally compared against plan or budget and prior performance. The financial plans accompanying a strategic plan may include 3–5 years of projected performance.

[[McKinsey &amp; Company]] developed a [[capability maturity model]] in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year financial plans and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread [[strategic thinking]] occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.
Categories 3 and 4 are strategic planning, while the first two categories are non-strategic or essentially financial planning. Each stage builds on the previous stages; that is, a stage 4 organization completes activities in all four categories.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"&gt;{{cite book

For Michael C. Sekora, [[Project Socrates]] founder in the Reagan White House, during the [[cold war]] the economically challenged [[Soviet Union]] was able to keep on western military capabilities by using technology-based planning while the U.S. was slowed by finance-based planning, until the Reagan administration launched the Socrates Project, which should be revived to keep up with [[China as an emerging superpower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/defense/opinion-cold-war-budget-tool-could-save-pentagon |title= Opinion: The Cold War Budget Tool That Could Save The Pentagon |date= Feb 2, 2018 |author= Michael C. Sekora |work= [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Strategic planning vs. strategic thinking===
Strategic planning has been criticized for attempting to systematize [[strategic thinking]] and strategy formation, which [[Henry Mintzberg]] argues are inherently creative activities involving synthesis or "connecting the dots" which cannot be systematized.  Mintzberg argues that strategic planning can help coordinate planning efforts and measure progress on strategic goals, but that it occurs "around" the strategy formation process rather than within it. Further, strategic planning functions remote from the "front lines" or contact with the competitive environment (i.e., in business, facing the customer where the effect of competition is most clearly evident) may not be effective at supporting strategy efforts.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

'''Topple rate''' is a name of a ratio of speed at which firms lose their leadership positions. It was believed that it was originally created by Jack Percival following losing his job. The Wall Street Journal article that appeared on September 9, 2007 attributes authorship to [[Patrick Viguerie]], a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant.

For example, the minicomputer industry began, grew up, got big, profitable, smug, senile and died in 20 years from 1975 to 1995. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] is a prime exemplar. In this case the topple rate of the minicomputer industry was 20 years.

A high topple rate is especially frequently used as a saying in fields of technological business.

The [[Red Queen's race]] has incredible evolutionary similarities. To maintain a leadership position, an industry must change at the same or faster rate than competing industries.

'''Visual Business Intelligence (VBI)''' is knowledge based on the application of visual data to a business problem or opportunity.

The process of visual [[business intelligence]] starts with the collection of visual data which is analyzed to create unique information. This information becomes knowledge when it is applied to a business problem or opportunity. For example, visual data is collected from a [[Retailing|retail store]] (the number of customers who enter an area of interest, the time they spend there and what direction they traveled). This data is analyzed and becomes information (the answer to a simple question such as how long are people waiting in line?). In turn it becomes knowledge (the application of the data to business such as reducing wait times and decreasing departures by opening additional [[cash register]]s between 11am and 2PM on weekends or when more than five people are waiting in line). The opportunity then exists to move further to forecast and even model physical customer behavior.

“Businesses have only begun to tap the capabilities of visual business intelligence. I see a future where we wonder how anyone operated a business without some level of VBI as part of their day to day business decision making.”
-Martin Renkis Smartvue Corporation
