A '''legal conflict among [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]], [[GMA Network]] and [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation]]''' in the [[Media in the Philippines|Philippines]] for an alleged [[audience measurement|television ratings]] [[breach of confidence|breach]] that occurred in [[Western Visayas|Western Visayan]] cities of [[Bacolod City|Bacolod]] and [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], has been ongoing since the last quarter of 2007-2008.

==Background==
On December 20, 2007, Judge Charito Gonzales, [[Quezon City]] Regional Trial Court Br. 80 released a [[temporary restraining order]] on TV ratings [[statistical survey|surveys]] based on a [[civil case]] filed by [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation]] versus AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines. ABS-CBN accused rival [[GMA Network]] of funding bribing operations at [[Bacolod City]], to discredit the former. The Court further ordered ABS-CBN to file comment on the plea of AGB Nielsen for the alleged gathering and dissemination of television ratings data, within five days or until 22 December.

On December 21, 2007, [[DZMM]] correspondent Junrie Hidalgo reported a [[news story]] titled ''AGB Nielsen, umamin sa dayaan: GMA Network, tahasang itinurong nasa likod ng dayaan'' (AGB Nielsen admits the cheating: GMA Network fiercely accused of being responsible of the cheating) during the program Showbiz Mismo, hosted by [[Cristy Fermin]] and Jobert Sucaldito. The news story is based on an [[interview]] of AGB Nielsen's [[General Manager]] Maya Reforma regarding the alleged cheating.

In response, GMA aired a TV plug condemning the alleged biased reporting and denied the accusations of ABS-CBN. They later filed a PHP15-million civil [[libel]] suit against ABS-CBN on 3 January 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station manager and news manager of DZMM and hosts, writers and executive producers of TV programs Bandila, Entertainment Live and [[The Buzz (talk show)|The Buzz]] after the same story was aired on the mentioned programs.

On January 7, 2008, the Quezon City RTC junked ABS-CBN's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was "prematurely filed" before the court. Judge Charito Gonzales's basis is the principle of mutuality of [[contracts]], citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, QCRTC, Branch 92 issued [[court summons]] against ABS-CBN and its 15 personnel, in the P15-million damage suit by GMA Network.

On January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/76893/Judge-in-ratings-row-recuss-self GMANews.TV, Judge in ratings row recuss self]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/77017/Re-raffle-of-GMA-Network-case-vs-ABS-CBN-reset-to-Jan-28 GMANews.TV, Re-raffle of GMA Network case vs ABS-CBN reset to Jan 28]&lt;/ref&gt; and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95, QCRTC. Judge Inting submitted GMA's petition for a temporary restraining order for decision.

On February 1, ABS-CBN presented two witnesses, Romie Diamanse and Francis Casumpang, saying [[List of GMA Network affiliate stations|RGMA]] head [[Mike Enriquez]] was said to have given the order to cheat in a meeting. Enriquez denied the charges and said that the statements were "shameless, malicious fiction delivered by tainted informers with an axe to grind." Diamanse and Casumpang were former employees of RGMA's 93.5 Campus Radio Iloilo (now [[DYMK-FM|Barangay FM 93.5 Iloilo]]). Casumpang resigned from the station after charges of embezzlement, and now works for ABS-CBN's [[DYMC-FM|MOR 91.1 Iloilo]]. On the other hand, RGMA accepted Diamanse's resignation "because he was regarded as ineffective in his duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/news/16280/Mike-Enriquez:-ABS-CBN-shameless-in-its-efforts-to-discredit-GMA-Network. Mike Enriquez: "ABS-CBN shameless in its efforts to discredit GMA Network"] by, Erwin Santiago, Philippine Entertainment Portal.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008, Judge Inting issued a TRO barring ABS-CBN from airing defamatory statements against GMA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/80544/QC-court-issues-TRO-vs-ABS-CBN-in-ratings-tussle GMANews.TV, QC court issues TRO vs ABS-CBN in ratings tussle]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Prairie Home Companion''''' is a weekly radio [[variety show]] created and hosted by [[Garrison Keillor]] that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician [[Chris Thile]] took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed ''[[Live from Here]]''. ''A Prairie Home Companion'' aired on Saturdays from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]; it was also frequently heard on tours to [[New York City]] and other U.S. cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, "[[Lake Wobegon|News from Lake Wobegon]]", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.

Distributed by [[Minnesota Public Radio]]'s distribution arm, [[American Public Media]], ''A Prairie Home Companion'' was heard on 690 [[public radio]] stations in the United States at its peak in spring{{Date needed|date=April 2018}} 2015 and reached an audience of four million U.S. listeners each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/12/06/whats-next-after-end-of-decades-long-keillor-mpr-relationship/|title=What’s next after end of decades-long Keillor-MPR relationship?|date=2017-12-06|work=Twin Cities|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show borrowed its name from a radio program in existence in 1969 that was named after the [[Prairie Home Cemetery]] near [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]], in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/hodgepodge/25anniversary/list/c_cemetery.html| title=PHC 25th anniversary website| accessdate=December 15, 2009| website=prairiehome.publicradio.org}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired a 2006 [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film of the same name]], written by Keillor, directed by [[Robert Altman]], and featuring Keillor, [[Kevin Kline]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]].

==History==
=== Origin ===
The Saturday-evening show was a partial spin-off of ''A Prairie Home Morning Show'' with Keillor and [[Tom Keith]], which ran from 6 to 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. on [[Minnesota Public Radio]] and was continued by Keith and Dale Connelly for many years as ''[[The Morning Show (Minnesota Public Radio)|The Morning Show.]]''

After researching the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' took place. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of [[Macalester College]]. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by [[Butch Thompson]], who became house pianist. Thompson stayed with the program until 1986 and still frequently performs on the show.

In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which Minnesota Public Radio purchased and renovated in 1986 and renamed the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in 1994. This is the same venue the program uses today.

=== Hiatus ===
The show went off the air in 1987, with a "final performance" on June 13, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. For a brief time, the show was replaced—both on the air and in the World Theater—by ''[[Good Evening (radio program)|Good Evening]]'', hosted by [[Noah Adams]], a live variety show designed by ex-''Prairie Home'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' staffers to retain the audience Keillor had cultivated over the years. However, many stations opted instead to continue ''APHC'' repeats in its traditional Saturday time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Bowermaster| first=Jon| title=Fresh Voices Hope to Be Far From Wobegon| newspaper=The New York Times| date=December 13, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/13/arts/television-fresh-voices-hope-to-be-far-from-wobegon.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Keillor returned to radio with ''The American Radio Company of the Air'' (renamed ''Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company'' in its second season), broadcast originally from the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. The new program featured a broadly similar format to ''A Prairie Home Companion'', with sketches and musical guests reflecting a more New York sensibility, rather than the country and folk music predominant in ''APHC''. Also, while Keillor sang and delivered a regular monologue on ''American Radio Company'', Lake Wobegon was initially downplayed, as he felt it was "cruel" to talk to a [[Brooklyn, NY|Brooklyn]] audience about life in a small town. During this period, Keillor revived the full ''APHC'' format only for "annual farewell performances". In the fall of 1992, Keillor returned to the World Theater with ''ARC'' for the majority of the season, with Lake Wobegon and other ''APHC'' elements gradually but unmistakably returning to prominence.
=== Return and final years ===
[[File:2011APHC.jpg|thumb|''A Prairie Home Companion'' at the 2011 Minnesota State Fair]]
The following year, on October 2, 1993, the program officially reverted to the ''A Prairie Home Companion'' name and format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Songer| first=Marcia| title=Garrison Keillor: A Critical Companion| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=2000| pages=9–10| isbn=0-313-30230-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the episodes originated from St. Paul, the show often traveled to other cities around the U.S. and overseas for its live weekly broadcasts. Common road venues included [[The Town Hall]] in New York City; [[Tanglewood]] in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]]; [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] in [[Vienna, Virginia]]; [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Los Angeles; and the State Theater in [[Minneapolis]]. It also broadcast a show each year from the [[Minnesota State Fair]].

The show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with [[Public Radio International]]. Later, its distributor was Minnesota Public Radio's distribution unit, [[American Public Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Listening Information {{!}} A Prairie Home Companion| url=https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| website=www.prairiehome.org| accessdate=2 December 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234731/https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| archive-date=December 2, 2016| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest hosts===
[[File:2016-01-30ChrisThileAPHC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Thile as guest host in 2016]]
Singer [[Sara Watkins]] of San Diego, California hosted the January 15, 2011, broadcast. The format was the same, but Keillor appeared only as a guest actor and to deliver the News from Lake Wobegon. He claimed he had taken the chance to see the show being performed for himself. It was reported that this could be the beginning of a trend toward Keillor's eventual retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2011/01/the-news-from-lake-woebegon-more-guest-hosts-likely.shtml |title=The news from Lake Wobegon: more guest hosts likely &amp;#124; State of the Arts |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 16, 2011, Keillor stated in an interview with the [[AARP]] that he would most likely retire from the show by the time he turned 70 in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Carol (2011-03-16).

Retrieved March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2011, [[Erica Rhodes]] expressed frustration over not being picked to guest host.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In September 2011, Keillor told ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' that his last broadcast would be recorded in "early July 2013", and that instead of a permanent replacement host, there will be "a whole group of people. A rotation of hosts",&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Mark Hughes (2011-09-09). [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110909/NEWS/110909751/-1/entertainment?p=5&amp;tc=pg 'Prairie Home Companion' tour comes to the Amp]. ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]''. Page 5 of 5. Retrieved September 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2011 Keillor said he had changed his mind and reconsidered his plans to retire because he still enjoyed hosting the show.

On February 7 and 14, 2015, mandolinist [[Chris Thile]] hosted the show (like Sara Watkins, a member of [[Nickel Creek]]). As when Watkins hosted, the format remained largely unchanged, but Keillor did not make an appearance. Instead, storyteller [[Tristan Jimerson]] appeared on the February 7 show and comedian/storyteller [[Elna Baker]] on the February 14 show. Thile's band [[Punch Brothers]] performed on the February 7 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seel |first1=Steve |title=Musician Chris Thile subs for Keillor on APHC |url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/02/07/thile |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=February 7, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thile was named permanent host of the show in late June 2015. Keillor's last show as host was recorded on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the following day. Thile took over as permanent host on October 15, 2016.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Garrison Keillor hosts final A Prairie Home Companion episode |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/02/garrison-keillor-final-prairie-home-companion-episode |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=July 2, 2016 |access-date=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Lauretta.

[[File:OnAirAPHC.jpg|thumb|right|On Air sign at the Fitzgerald Theater]]
From the show's inception until 1987, its theme song was [[Hank Snow]]'s hit "[[Hello Love (Hank Snow song)|Hello Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Sawyer| first1=Bobbie Jean| title=The Country Roots of 'A Prairie Home Companion'| url=http://www.wideopencountry.com/the-country-roots-of-a-prairie-home-companion/|website=Wide Open Country| accessdate=2 December 2016| date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1987, each show has opened with [[Spencer Williams]]' composition "[[Tishomingo Blues]]" as the theme song, with lyrics written especially for ''A Prairie Home Companion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Barton| first1=Chris| title=Garrison Keillor brings 'A Prairie Home Companion' to a close at the Hollywood Bowl| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-st-prairie-home-companion-final-show-review-20160627-snap-story.html| accessdate=2 December 2016| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is a main feature of the program; the show is a significant outlet for [[American folk music]] of many genres, especially [[country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[blues]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]], but it also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera, and music from a number of different countries. The country musician and former record company executive [[Chet Atkins]] has appeared on the show many times, as have singer-songwriters [[Mark Knopfler]] (lead guitarist and [[frontman]] of the bands [[Dire Straits]] and the [[Notting Hillbillies]]) and [[Jeff Lang]]. Folk/gospel duo [[Robin and Linda Williams]] have been regular guests since 1976, and often join Keillor and another female performer, often [[Jearlyn Steele]], to form "The Hopeful Gospel Quartet". [[Peter Ostroushko]], [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], [[Jean Redpath]], and [[Prudence Johnson]], among others, were recurring guests on the program between 1974 and 1987. The [[Wailin' Jennys]] and Andra Suchy are current recurring guests, and when the show travels, Keillor generally features local musicians and acts.

Greetings from members of the audience to friends and family at home (frequently humorous) are read each week by Keillor just after the show's [[intermission]], at the top of the second hour. Birthdays and anniversaries of famous composers and musicians are also observed.

===Features===
[[File:PrairieHomeCompanion2007RhubarbSisters.JPG|thumb|190px|The Rhubarb Sisters singing during taping of the show]]
Keillor and the ensemble performed comedy [[skits]]. Notable skits and characters often recur, such as the satirical "[[Guy Noir]], [[Private investigator|Private Eye]]", which parodied [[film noir]] and [[radio dramas]]. Guy Noir's popularity was such that the first few notes of the theme or the first lines of the announcer's introduction ("A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets&amp;nbsp;...") often drew applause and cheers from the audience. Also regularly featured were the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, "The Lives of the Cowboys".

===News from Lake Wobegon===
One of the show's best-known features was Keillor's "News from Lake Wobegon", a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from his fictitious hometown of [[Lake Wobegon]], "the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve&amp;nbsp;... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average". The opening words of the [[monologue]] usually did not change: "Well, it's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the [[prairie]]." Keillor often poked fun at central Minnesota's large [[Scandinavian-American]] and [[German-American]] communities, and many of his fictional characters have names that reflect this. The "News from Lake Wobegon" did not have a set structure, but featured recurring characters and places such as the Chatterbox Café, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Ingqvist of the Lake Wobegon [[Lutheran Church]] and his successor Pastor Liz, Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Roman Catholic Church (a parody of [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} the Lake Wobegon [[Whippets]] sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby "Norwegian bachelor farmers".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Once a year the program featured a special "joke show", which generally included the Lake Wobegon monologue and musical acts, but with other skits replaced by the performers taking turns telling jokes. Humorists such as [[Paula Poundstone]] and [[Roy Blount Jr.]] often made guest appearances on those shows, and listeners and audience members were encouraged to submit jokes for use on the air.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[In-joke]]s are also sprinkled through the show, such as "Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin", a made-up word that's been used both for places and for people's names. The components of this made-up word are portions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] place names in the New England region of the United States, most of them in Maine (i.e.: Piscataqua, Passamaquoddy, and Androscoggin).

===Fictional sponsors===
[[Image:PrairieHomeCompanionGuysShoes.JPG|thumb|right|A sign for "Guy's Shoes", one of ''A&amp;nbsp;Prairie Home Companion''{{'}}s fictitious sponsors.]]
The show creates fictional advertisements for fictional products, performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show acknowledges its actual [[underwriting spot|underwriters]] at the beginning, end, and middle (break) of the show.

''Prairie Home''{{'}}s most prominent "sponsor" is the fictitious "Powdermilk Biscuits". Before he and the band performed the product's jingle every week ("Has your family tried 'em, Powdermilk?"), [[Garrison Keillor]] would extol Powdermilk's virtues in this way:

{{cquote|Heavens they're tasty, and expeditious. Give shy persons the strength they need to get up and do what needs to be done. Made from whole wheat raised by Norwegian bachelor farmers, so you know they're not only good for you, they're pure, mostly. Get 'em in the bright blue box with a picture of a biscuit on the front, or ready-made in the brown bag with the dark stains that indicate freshness.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{ cite book| last=Lee| first=Judith Yaross| year=1991| title=Garrison Keillor: A Voice of America| series=Studies in Popular Culture| pages=35, 85| location=Jackson, MS| publisher=University Press of Mississippi| isbn=978-1617033995 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UttaAAAAMAAJ| access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among its other "sponsors", Bebop-A-Reebop [[Rhubarb pie|Rhubarb Pie]] (and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling) has been prominent, with ads featuring the Bebop-A-Reebop jingle, performed to the tune of "[[Shortnin' Bread]]":{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{quote|One little thing can revive a guy&lt;br&gt; And that is a piece of rhubarb pie&lt;br&gt; Serve it up, nice and hot&lt;br&gt; Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought&lt;br&gt; Momma's little baby loves rhubarb, rhubarb&lt;br&gt; Bebopareebop rhubarb pie.&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx&gt;{{cite web | author = Keillor, Garrison, [[Tim Russell]], [[Sue Scott (actress)|Sue Scott]], and [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] | date = February 14, 2004 | title = Rhubarb [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor''] | format=transcript| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2004/02/14/scripts/rhurbarb.shtml| location = Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}} [Contributing performer/writer names for this program were inferred by a Wikipedia editor from initials appearing in this source, based on regular cast information appearing elsewhere.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} The jingle is usually sung after a bombastic, sound-effect-enhanced tale of woe, and is immediately followed by Keillor asking, "Wouldn't this be a great time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and humiliation out of your mouth quite like Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie."&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx/&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}}

Other prominent "sponsors" include Bertha's Kitty Boutique, whose locations in the fictional "Dales" shopping centers ("Roy 'n' Dale, Airedale, Teasdale, Clydesdale, Chippendale, Mondale, and all the other fine shopping centers") allude to various real people and things, and The Catchup &lt;!-- CORRECT SPELLING, see http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/20030927/scripts/catchup.shtml --&gt;Advisory Board — its name a mashup of the common "catsup" and "ketchup" spellings—which has the tagline "Catchup: For the good times."&lt;ref name=CatchupEx&gt;{{cite web| last1=Keillor| first1=Garrison| first2=Tim| last2=Russell| first3=Sue| last3=Scott| first4=Rich| last4=Dworsky| last-author-amp=yes| date=February 4, 2012| title=Catchup [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor'']| format=streaming video| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2012/02/04/videos/02.shtml| location=Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the recurring segment "The Lives of the Cowboys" featured its own Western-themed sponsors, including Prairie Dog Granola Bars ("healthier than chewing tobacco and you don't have to spit") and Cowboy Toothpicks ("the toothpick that's guaranteed not to splinter").{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Alterations===
While much of the show is directed toward [[radio comedy]], a portion is usually devoted to some more sentimental and sometimes dark stories put together by Keillor and others. The program occasionally also features political satire. At the beginning of the June 5, 2004, show (broadcast from [[Meadowbrook U.S. Cellular Pavilion|Meadowbrook Musical Arts Center]] in [[Gilford, New Hampshire]]), Keillor announced that former U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] had died. A member of the audience hooted and cheered loudly, but Keillor, a staunch Democrat, gave the Republican Reagan a warm tribute in the form of a gospel song. Similarly, in a 2002 show airing the weekend after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], Keillor changed the format of the show, starting it off with Wellstone's favorite segment, Guy Noir, skipping even the show's theme song.

{{primary sources|date=December 2008}}An '''audition website''' is a web site that aggregates [[audition]] information and delivers this information via the [[World Wide Web]]. There are hundreds of companies that operate [[acting]], [[Model (person)|modeling]], and [[dancing]] audition websites. Originally, only talent agents were able to provide actors, models, dancers and other performers with audition information. This meant that only performers that were represented by Talent Agents could go on auditions. Today, both open auditions and private auditions can be found on reliable audition websites. Talented performers can browse the World Wide Web and find many different audition websites. The primary organization of professional screen and theater casting in the United States is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA). Membership to the CSA is optional.

Audition websites are an integral component in the employment statistics&lt;ref name="employment statistics"&gt;''Bureau Of Labor Statistics ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos093.htm employment statistics] Occupational Outlook Handbook - Actors, Producers, and Directors&lt;/ref&gt; of actors and other industry professionals.  Most acting assignments are typically short term and range from 1 day to a few months. Many professional actors use either agents or managers to find work, and plan their careers. A [[talent agent]] generally earns a percentage of the pay earned by an actor, as specified in the actor’s contract. Other actors rely solely on attending open [[auditions]], found on audition websites, for parts.

Some audition websites require membership and others are free to use. Most all audition websites involve the member regularly browsing audition listings and "self-submitting" for auditions. This enables members to choose the types of jobs that they audition for. Other than membership dues, audition websites do not charge other fees or take a percentage of income earned from jobs. Audition websites have grown in popularity and the most visited audition websites have memberships in the millions. A [[casting director]], [[talent agent]], [[film producer]], or [[movie director]] can use Audition websites to locate performers for casting. These industry professionals use audition websites to find talent for commercials, [[music videos]], [[movies]], and other entertainment projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

A recurring theme in the literary, theatrical and film tradition of [[comedy]] is the use of [[stock character]]s representing [[authority]] figures, designed to poke fun at officialdom by showing that its members are not immune to entanglement in the ridiculous. This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''.

This theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, [[Monty Python]]. In their sketches, a "common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hight, Jane Roscoe. ''Faking It: Mock-Documentary and the Subversion of Factuality''. Manchester University Press (2002) {{ISBN|0-7190-5641-1}} (p. 80).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include: 
*Police officers, as seen in ''[[Keystone Kops]]'', ''[[Inspector Clouseau]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Police Academy (film series)|Police Academy]]'', ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' and ''[[Carry On films|Carry On Constable]]''.
*Soldiers, as seen in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Carry On films|Carry on Sergeant]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' and [[Il Capitano]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
*Civil servants, as seen in ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053044 Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1959)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ministry of Silly Walks]]'' and ''[[Spin City]]''.
*Priests, as seen in ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]'' and ''[[Father Ted]]''.
*Teachers, [[Principal (school)|principals]], and [[dean (education)|deans]], as seen in ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''[[High School High]]''.

Some television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', have a collection of characters that represent all of the main groups of authority figures, and each portray such figures as humorously flawed. Indeed, each show has a resident police officer — [[Recurring South Park characters#Officer Barbrady|Officer Barbrady]] and [[Chief Wiggum]], respectively — portrayed as an incompetent and bumbling idiot. The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader — [[Priest Maxi]] in ''South Park'' and [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy]] in ''The Simpsons''. The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.

Examples can also be found in the art of the [[Russian joke]].

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, following the example of [[ballad opera]], the words of the songs were written to popular music;&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; later burlesques mixed the music of [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them.  This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.  [http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf "Desperately Seeking Lydia" and "Appreciating Lydia",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513080257/http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }} ''The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine'', Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;  New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular [[minstrel show]]s. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included [[Fanny Brice]], [[Mae West]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref name=humez/&gt;

'''''Casefile True Crime Podcast''''', or simply '''''Casefile''''', is a weekly (sometimes fortnightly) [[true crime]] themed [[podcast]] that first aired in Australia in January 2016 and hosted by an Australian man who remains anonymous. The series deals with solved or [[Cold case|cold criminal cases]], often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur]] or the [[Snowtown murders]]), although notable crimes from the UK and the USA are increasingly featured,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/casefile-true-crime-podcast-becomes-global-hit-as-it-examines-uks-most-notorious-crimes-a3500716.html|title=Podcast becomes global hit as it examines UK's most notorious crimes|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cases from Canada, France, Guyana, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and Ukraine have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-australian-podcasts|title=The best Australian podcasts to listen to right now|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger and more-complex cases, such as [[Peter Sutcliffe|The Yorkshire Ripper]], [[Moors murders|The Moors Murders]], and [[Original Night Stalker|The East Area Rapist]], have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut, including Best of 2016 (iTunes).

== Production ==
The podcast first aired on 9 January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whatpods.com/ama/casefile/|title=AMA with the host of Casefile True Crime|work=WhatPods|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'', ''[[Dan Carlin|Hardcore History]]'', ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' and ''[[Making a Murderer|Making A Murderer]])'' at the time, and was encouraged by [[Joe Rogan]] to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to one source, the host remains anonymous because "he wants the stories, facts, and questions speak for themselves"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://shesaid.com/8-podcasts-binge-youre-obsessed-true-crime/|title=9 Podcasts To Binge If You’re Obsessed With True Crime|date=2018-02-14|work=SHE'SAID'|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "It makes the show about the stories and that's it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to another review, the podcast's:&lt;blockquote&gt;deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aux.avclub.com/our-favorite-podcasts-of-2016-1798255734|title=Our favorite podcasts of 2016|last=Bulnes|first=Rebecca|work=AUX|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In its current format, the 2018 ''Casefile'' team now consists of two researcher/writers, two composers, a designer, and the host/narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://casefilepodcast.com/team/|title=Team - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, “since about episode 7”, which led to episodes 1–6 being reworked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|national archives]] in [[Kew]] in 2017 to examine police files on [[Myra Hindley]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author [[Eileen Ormsby]]. 

Each case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as [http://casefilepodcast.com/case-53-east-area-rapist-1976-part-1/ in this example]. Warnings are regularly given at the start of podcasts due to the graphic content. It is available via numerous sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://audioboom.com/channel/casefile-true-crime|title=Casefile True Crime|website=audioboom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One episode, Case 55 (Simone Strobel, released 15 July 2017), has been removed due to legal issues, although general details of the case itself are publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2007/07/09/1973895.htm|title=Inquest hears Strobel boyfriend suspected in death|date=2007-07-09|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/police-study-luxury-beachside-life-of-man-whose-girlfriends-body-was-found-covered-in-palm-fronds/news-story/180de49076f1ca7c1e4249375d0a8dcb|title=Toby Moran’s life under scrutiny by police 12 years after his girlfriend’s mysterious death|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/casefile-true-crime-44949/episodes/case-55-simone-strobel-19346758|title=Case 55: Simone Strobel by Casefile True Crime on Podchaser|website=Podchaser|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Along with the recent rise in true crime podcasting, as seen in [[Serial (podcast)|Serial]] or [[S-Town]], the series has been reviewed positively by several sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/the-12-best-true-crime-podcasts-of-2018/|title=The 12 Best True Crime Podcasts Of 2018|work=LBC|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pickle.nine.com.au/2018/01/25/12/53/casefile-true-crime-podcast-qanda|title=Casefile: True Crime Podcast creator reveals story behind popular series|website=pickle.nine.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (22 July 2016):&lt;blockquote&gt;As ''Casefile'' points out in their tagline, fact is scarier than fiction. But what the podcast might really prove is that fact is ''even scarier'' when told in a thick Australian accent – especially when accompanied by ambient, pulsing noise from a trio of professional sound designers and musicians. In each weekly episode, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, the narrator... calmly tells a story of a devastating Australian crime. The podcast expertly covers murder and abduction, sometimes walking the listener through the criminal's trial, and other times discussing potential theories for a crime whose perpetrator was never caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/beyond-serial-10-true-crime-podcasts-you-need-to-follow-w429955/casefile-w429962|title=Beyond 'Serial': 10 True Crime Podcasts You Need to Follow|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[London Evening Standard|''Evening Standard'']] (28 March 2017):&lt;blockquote&gt;The Australian-made show, which launched in January last year, has regularly featured in the UK’s top 10 podcasts on iTunes in recent months. It also regularly reaches the top 50 in the US chart, rising as high as fourth last July. ... Its mini-series on Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe received 5.8 million downloads — the most for a single case since the launch. Its most popular single episode was on British tourist Peter Falconio ... [which] has more than 4.2 million downloads. A series covering the Moors Murders ... had more than a million downloads in four days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Download statistics by iTunesChart.net state that Casefile has charted in the top 100 in 4 regions, with peak ranking positions of the podcast including: Australia (1), Canada (9), United Kingdom (14), and United States (7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/artists/podcast/casefile-true-crime/podcasts/casefile-true-crime/|title=iTunesCharts.net: 'Casefile True Crime' by Casefile True Crime (International iTunes Chart Performance)|website=www.itunescharts.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the podcast has consistently been in the top 10 since May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/aus/artists/podcast/casefile-true-crime/podcasts/casefile-true-crime/|title=iTunesCharts.net: 'Casefile True Crime' by Casefile True Crime (Australian Podcasts iTunes Chart)|website=www.itunescharts.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Las Vegas Strip.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] is renowned for its high concentration of casino resort hotels]]

A '''casino''' is a facility which houses and accommodates certain types of [[gambling]] activities. The industry that deals in casinos is called the '''gaming industry'''. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions. There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/07/29/should-internet-gambling-be-legalized "Should Internet Gambling Be Legalized?"] (July 29, 2010). ''[New York Times]'', Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events.

==Etymology and usage==
The term "casino" is a confusing linguistic [[false friend]] for translators.

''Casino'' is of [[Italian language|Italian origin]]; the root ''casa'' means a house. The term casino may mean a small country [[villa]], [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]], or [[social club]].&lt;ref name=casitalian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=William N.|title=Gambling in America: An Encyclopedia of History, Issues, and Society|date=2015|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAI9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=casino+word+italian+casa+villa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DDO0I9XXek&amp;sig=eaYdPaCRmSGLtEQYWSDD6XzjeGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwB2oVChMIk8LsiYaxxwIVgowNCh2yOwsl#v=onepage&amp;q=casino%20word%20italian%20casa%20villa&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the term ''casino'' came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or [[palazzo]], and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports; examples in Italy include [[Villa Farnese]] and [[Villa Giulia]], and in the US the [[Newport Casino]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

==History of gambling houses==

The precise origin of gambling is unknown. It is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history. From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.

The first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bjørn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=ridotto+1638+casino&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycf-bQdcM5&amp;sig=sRJvGUBC40KsjX3kWOI19UYw7Bk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwB2oVChMIr-2H6IOxxwIVC9keCh18tAti#v=onepage&amp;q=ridotto%201638%20casino&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]]. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.

==Gambling in casinos==

Most jurisdictions worldwide have a minimum [[gambling age]] (16 to 21 years of age in most countries which permit the operation of casinos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spotoncasinos.com/news/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-a-casino/| title=How Old Do You Have To Be To Go To A Casino? | accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers gamble by playing [[casino game|games of chance]], in some cases with an element of skill, such as [[craps]], [[roulette]], [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], [[blackjack]], and [[video poker]]. Most games played have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an overall advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.

''Payout'' is the percentage of funds ("winnings") returned to players.

Casinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.

Video Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.&lt;ref&gt;

===Significant sites===
While there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.

====Monte Carlo, Monaco====
{{Main|Monte Carlo Casino}}
[[Monte Carlo Casino]], located in [[Monte Carlo]] city, in [[Monaco]], is a famous casino and a tourist attraction popular with well-off visitors. The casino is mentioned in the song [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (song)|The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo]] as well as [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (film)|the film of the same name]].

Monte Carlo Casino has been depicted in many books, including [[Ben Mezrich]]'s ''[[Busting Vegas]]'', where a group of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] students beat the casino out of nearly $1 million. This book is based on real people and events; however, many of those events are contested by main character [[Semyon Dukach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-semyon-dukach-mit-card-counting-team-captain/| title=ThePOGG Interviews - Semyon Dukach - MIT Card Counting Team Captain | accessdate=2012-10-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Carlo Casino has also been featured in multiple [[James Bond]] novels and films.

====Campione d'Italia====
{{Main|Casinò di Campione}}
Casinò di Campione is located in the tiny [[Itay|Italian]] enclave of [[Campione d'Italia]], within [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]], [[Switzerland]]. The casino was founded in 1917 as a site to gather information from foreign diplomats during the First World War. Today it is owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. With gambling laws being less strict than in Italy and Switzerland, it is among most popular gambling destination besides Monte Carlo. The income from the casino is sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue.&lt;ref name=nytehs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/enclave-hunting-in-switzerland/ |title=Enclave-Hunting in Switzerland |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=Frank Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the casino moved into new premises of more than {{convert|55000|m2}}, making it the largest casino in Europe.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/business/21586616-casinos-are-licence-print-money-right-not-one-losing-streak Gambling: Losing streak&lt;/ref&gt; The new casino was built alongside the old one, which dated from 1933 and has since been demolished.&lt;ref name=nytehs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://como-lake.arounder.com/en/casinos/casino-campione-d-italia | title = Casinó Campione d'Italia | work = Arounder | publisher = VRWAY Communication | accessdate = 2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macau====

The former [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colony]] of [[Macau]], a [[Special administrative region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] of [[China]] since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when Macau was popular with visitors from nearby [[British Empire|British]] [[Hong Kong]], where gambling was more closely regulated. [[The Venetian Macao]] is currently the largest casino in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casino.org/blog/the-worlds-largest-casino/|title=10 Of The World's Largest Casinos: The Biggest Casinos Ever!|date=25 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macau also surpassed Las Vegas as the largest gambling market in the world.

====Estoril, Cascais, Portugal====
{{Main|Casino Estoril}}
[[File:Casino Estoril - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Casino Estoril]], in [[Portuguese Riviera]], is Europe's largest casino by capacity.]]
The [[Casino Estoril]], located in the municipality of [[Cascais]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]], near [[Lisbon]], is the largest casino in Europe by capacity.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it was reputed to be a gathering point for [[spy|spies]], dispossessed [[royal family|royals]], and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond|James Bond 007]] novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.

====Singapore====

[[Singapore]] is an up-and-coming destination for visitors wanting to gamble, although there are currently only two casinos (both foreign owned), in Singapore. The [[Marina Bay Sands]] is the most expensive standalone casino in the world, at a price of US$8 billion, and is among the [[List of most expensive buildings in the world|world's ten most expensive buildings]]. The [[Resorts World Sentosa]] has the world's largest [[oceanarium]].

====United States====
{{main|Gambling in the United States}}
With currently over 1,000 casinos, the United States has the largest number of casinos in the world. The number continues to grow steadily as more states seek to legalize casinos. 40 states now{{when|date=December 2017}} have some form of casino gambling. Relatively small places such as [[Las Vegas]] are best known for gambling; larger cities such as [[Chicago]] are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.

The [[Las Vegas Valley]] has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States. Based on revenue, [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] ranks second, and the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago region]] third.

==Security==
{{main|Casino security}}
[[File:noidnoentry.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|A sign at the [[OLG Casino Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands Casino]]]]
Given the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. [[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.

Modern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.

When it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.

==Business practices==
Over the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes "Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009).

According to some police reports, incidences of reported crime often double and triple in communities within three years of a casino opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html#ixzz1Qbh6hiXF "Gambling addiction leads many down criminal road"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025307/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html |date=2011-06-25 }}, [[Jeremy Boren]], (June 19, 2011). ''[[The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;McCorkle, Richard C., "Gambling and Crime Among Arrestees: Exploring the Link" (July 2004). ''U.S. Department of Justice'. Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that economic studies that show a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Douglas M. "Do Casinos Really Cause Crime?" (Jan 2008). ''Econ Journal Watch'' [http://econjwatch.org/articles/do-casinos-really-cause-crime]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casino Employee Occupational Health and Safety ==
There has been some research into [[Casino Employee Occupational Health and Safety|occupational health issues in the casino industry]]. Particular issues that have been reported on include alcohol abuse, second-hand tobacco smoke, and some musculo-skeletal  problems associated with card-dealing.

'''Charles William Ingram''' (born 1963) is an English former [[British Army]] [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] who became known for cheating on the television [[game show]] ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' in 2001, after winning the maximum prize of a million pounds. Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, he was convicted on a single count of [[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]. In 2003, he was convicted of an unrelated insurance fraud, and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the [[Army Board]].

Ingram is married to Diana Ingram, and has since participated in other television shows, including ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|The Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'', ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', and on ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]''.

==Education and career==
In 1986, he trained for the [[British Army|Army]] at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and was commissioned as an [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Royal Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50733 |date=1 December 1986 |page=15537 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the rank of [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52131 |date=8 May 1990 |page=8819 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and major in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54173 |date=2 October 1995 |pages=13315–13316  |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999, he served in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] for six months on [[NATO]] [[peacekeeping]] duties.
He was forced to resign from the Army in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57069 |date=30 September 2003 |page=12055 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News–Army"&gt;{{cite news|title=Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=24 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: ''The Network'', published on 27 April 2006, and ''Deep Siege'', published on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/i/charles-ingram/deep-siege.htm |title=Deep Siege by Charles Ingram |accessdate=17 December 2012 |date=8 October 2007 | work=Fantastic Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 and 10 September 2001, Ingram was a contestant on the television game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. His wife Diana Ingram and her brother Adrian Pollock had previously been contestants on the show, both winning £32,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2823407.stm |title=Major Charles Ingram has been found guilty of cheating his way to the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=7 April 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Martin Bashir]] |year=2003 |title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Major Fraud |medium=Television |publisher=ITV |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, presented by [[Chris Tarrant]], was one of the highest-rated in the United Kingdom at its peak in 1999; one edition was watched by 19 million viewers, a third of the British population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vdqdw9/15-years-of-the-coughing-major-who-wants-to-be-a-millionare|title=That Time a Guy Won 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' by Cheating Terribly|date=2016-09-09|work=Vice|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time recording ended on the first day, Ingram had reached £4,000 and used two of his three "lifelines". The production team doubted he would proceed much further when recording resumed, but he went on to win the top prize of £1 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ingram flipped between answers erratically, appearing to settle on one answer before suddenly moving to another. For example, when asked who recorded the 2000 [[Craig David]] album ''[[Born to Do It]]'', Ingram said he had "never heard of" David and appeared to go for a different option before moving to the correct answer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The show's production company [[Celador]] suspended the £1 million payout after they suspected Ingram had cheated. Production staff accused Ingram and his wife of defrauding the show by having an accomplice in the audience, lecturer Tecwen Whittock, cough when Ingram read out a correct answer.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Tarrant, who drank champagne with the Ingrams in their dressing room, said he was convinced that Ingram was genuine when he signed the £1 million cheque: "If I thought there was anything wrong, I certainly would not have signed it." When asked whether the atmosphere in the dressing room was tense after the show, Tarrant replied: "No, not at all. They seemed as normal as people who have just won a million pounds would be in the situation." However, he said that on his way to the dressing room, "I had been told there had been quite an unpleasant exchange."&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; A member of the crew, Eve Winstanley, testified in court that Ingram seemed "very unhappy" for someone who had just won a million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2836937.stm|title=Millionaire winner 'unhappy'|date=10 March 2003|accessdate=13 May 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celador employees produced and reviewed various compilation tapes before and after contacting the police. Celador and their editing company, Editworks, retained all the tapes during the case and reproduced all tapes for the court.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In court, Paul Smith of Celador Productions confirmed that his company had previously produced a television programme involving witnesses in the case, for broadcast on ITV after the trial. The program, ''Tonight With Trevor McDonald – Major Fraud'', was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] a month after the trial, and credited with over 17 million viewers. Two weeks later, the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US, the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.

=== Trial ===
Following [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), which ended soon after a jury member was evicted for discussing the case in public, Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of "[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months), each fined £15,000, and each ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram £40,000 and Diana Ingram £25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay £115,000.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

On 19 August 2003, the [[Army Board]] ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major, after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2004, the [[Court of Appeal]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3728929.stm |title=TV quiz cheat loses his appeal |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 May 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2004, the House of Lords denied Ingram his leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. On 20 October 2004, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana Ingram's defence costs order to £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3762688.stm |title=Quiz cheat has defence costs cut |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=21 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, journalist [[Jon Ronson]], who covered the case at the time for the ''Guardian'', wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson had observed that when the word "cough" was mentioned during the trial, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. James Plaskett, who had won £250,000 on ''Millionaire'' and had been in the audience three times, argued that this was an example of coughs being caused by unconscious triggers; Tecwen had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Plaskett argued that Tecwen had audibly said "no" in response to an incorrect option in the same way that many audience members whisper "no" to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'' by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

Charles Ingram's fine and court costs, totalling £25,000, were later reduced to £5,000 on appeal.

''[[Quiz (play)|Quiz]]'', a play written by [[James_Graham_(playwright)|James Graham]] that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the [[Minerva_Theatre,_Chichester|Minerva Theatre]], [[Chichester]], on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/quiz |title=Quiz |accessdate=18 November 2017 |publisher=Chichester Festival Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play transferred to the West End—playing at the [[Noël Coward Theatre]] from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412123518/http://quiztheplay.com/|title=Quiz the Play by James Graham {{!}} Official West End Website|date=2018-04-12|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recorded evidence====
In court, Ingram claimed the video tape was "unrepresentative of what I heard", and he continues to assert that it was "unfairly manipulated". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and for the "benefit of the jury" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither "listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were "significant". The prosecution asserted that these "significant" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time after the correct answer had been spoken. [[Chris Tarrant]] also denied hearing any coughing in court, claiming he was too busy to notice.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/quizshowscam/Quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-1m.2410121.jp |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear £1m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====
Larry Whitehurst, another contestant who has appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.&lt;ref name="BBC News–Coughs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Contestant 'spotted Millionaire coughs'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2839587.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=11 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testimony of Tecwen Whittock====
Whittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,938649,00.html |title=So I phoned a friend – part two |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 April 2003 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answer.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager" /&gt; During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager" /&gt; Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2888791.stm |title=Cheating 'silly' says Millionaire accused |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=26 March 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to question number 12, regarding the artist who painted ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'', in a hand-written general knowledge book at his home.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Pager-plot-too-risky-for.2408136.jp |title=Pager plot too risky for TV quiz |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=7 March 2003 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=John |last=Innes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022105328/http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/pager-plot-too-risky-for-tv-quiz-1-548871|archivedate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies, the floor manager, said that, as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording, he decided to find out who was responsible. "The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three", he said. "He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough." Whittock remarked during the trial that "you do not cough into someone's face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portia.org/chapter14/major.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020172443/http://www.portia.org/chapter14/major.html |archivedate=20 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a "serial quiz show loser" because he had been eliminated in round one of ''[[Fifteen to One|15 to 1]]'' and had only won an atlas on his appearance on ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman_whittock"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=788&amp;id=360802003 |title=Lecturer a serial quiz show failure, court is told |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=26 March 2003 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman|last=Innes|first=John|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418205015/http://www.news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?id=360802003&amp;tid=788|archivedate=18 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance fraud==
In late 2003, the Ingrams were again in court, charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Charles Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth [[Crown Court]] of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell [[Direct Line]] Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. The court was told that Ingram had been a "habitual claimant" with [[Norwich Union]] after suffering "unfortunate" losses of private possessions.&lt;ref name=woolcock&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woolcock |first1=Nicola |title='Millionaire' quiz cheat guilty of insurance fraud |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445354/Millionaire-quiz-cheat-guilty-of-insurance-fraud.html |accessdate=2018-09-12 |work=Daily Telegraph (UK) |date=2003-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Parker]], prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to [[Zurich Insurance Group|Zurich]] in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. "He has been ineluctably dishonest," Mr Parker said. "He went to Direct Line and didn't make a disclosure about his claims history because he knew he wouldn't have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000." Staff at Direct Line were already "suspicious" about Ingram's £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on the game show.&lt;ref name=woolcock/&gt;

Ingram was given a [[conditional discharge]] on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance.

A '''clip show''' is an episode of a [[Television program|television series]] that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a [[frame story]] in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Clip shows are also known as '''cheaters''', particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before [[series finale]]s, or once [[100 episodes|syndication becomes highly likely]]. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).

==Origin==
Clip shows have their origin in theatrical [[short film]]s and [[Serial (film)|serials]]. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these '''recap chapters''' (also called "economy chapters"),
previous chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the [[Republic Pictures]] serial ''[[Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island]]''. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and [[stock footage]] from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.

Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of [[The Three Stooges]] which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for "new" films than for old ones.

Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as "cheaters" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include ''[[Betty Boop's Rise to Fame]]'' ([[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1934), ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Schlesinger]]/[[Warner Bros.]]) and a regular yearly series of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]'' "cheaters" such as ''[[Smitten Kitten]]'' (1952, [[MGM cartoon studio|MGM]]).

==Variations==
One variant of the modern clip show is the '''compilation episode''', using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.

Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'' featured actor [[Henry Fonda]] discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on ''[[Three's Company]]'', hosted by [[Lucille Ball]]. This format was parodied in a clip show for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"), in which fictional actor [[Troy McClure]]&amp;mdash;a recurring ''Simpsons'' character&amp;mdash;introduced the clips.

A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' aired after the death of cast member [[Jack Soo]], with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character [[Detective Sergeant]] Nick Yamana.

''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=98, Clerks: The Animated Series |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-04-18 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' episode "The Ember Island Players", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. "The Ember Island Players" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.

The [[NBC]] sitcom [[Community (TV series)|''Community'']] used the clip show format with the episode "[[Paradigms of Human Memory]]", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of ''Community'', [[Dan Harmon]], used the same format in another one of his shows, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.

In [[anime]], a common type of episode is the '''Recap episode''', which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.

==Rationale==
While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or "corny" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent "remembering").{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Daytime [[soap operas]] frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of ''AtWT''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th anniversary.

Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' season 3 episode "The Straight Poop" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the "weekly" series had been broadcast. ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' resorted to producing ''five'' clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.

Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' had one more episode to shoot. However, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for [[principal photography]]. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG 365"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Paula M.|last2=Erdmann|first2=Terry J.|last3=Moore|first3=Ronald D.|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation 365|date=2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613124000|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbTA9wMmEAC&amp;pg=PT330|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", in which the "clips" were the induced dreams of a comatose [[William T. Riker]]. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nemecek|first1=Larry|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780743476577|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1k_EsaOHsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in [[self-parody]], explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using "clips" from episodes which never happened.  The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned ''Moonlighting'' clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the [[fourth wall]] to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a "new episode next week!".

The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'']]. Many [[anime]] dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'' running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).

Sometimes clip shows air before or during a [[series finale]] as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''/''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Cheers]]''.

Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'' was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' for airing in syndication. Surviving content from [[Bozo the Clown]] and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into ''[[Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics]]'', an annual holiday special.

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Peter Berger writes that "It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society".&lt;ref name="BergerP78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name="CalleryP64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Description''' is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Description is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fiction-writing mode==
Fiction-writing also has modes: [[Action (fiction)|action]], exposition, description, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrell |2006 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selgin |2007 |p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of [[fiction-writing mode]]s and their uses.

Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in ''Writing from A to Z'', edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Polking |1990 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.

==Purple prose==
{{Main|Purple prose}}
A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ([[Latin]]:  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 20 [[Before Christ|BC]]) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, '''purple prose''' is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, the [[Theory of descriptions|nature of description]] has been an important question since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Ludlow|first= Peter |year=2007|title= Descriptions|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">The '''European Charter on Freedom of the Press''' is a non-binding guideline on [[press freedom]], signed on 25 May 2009 in [[Hamburg]] by 48 editors-in-chief and leading journalists from 19 European countries. It is open for signature by all journalists, e.g. the prohibition of [[censorship]], free access to national and foreign media sources and freedom to gather and disseminate information.&lt;ref name="PressFreedom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/ecpmf/charter |title=European Charter on Freedom of the Press |publisher=European Centre for Press &amp; Media Freedom |access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter condense in 10 articles the main [[media freedom]] principles, including the right to safety from surveillance, electronic eavesdropping and searches of editorial departments and computers, and remarks the need for unimpeded access for journalists and citizens to all domestic and foreign sources of information. It formulates the main values that public authorities - including EU institutions - should respect when dealing with journalists.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-891_en.htm?locale=en |title=Commissioner Reding welcomes New European Charter on Freedom of the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/New_European_Charter_Lays_Down_Guidelines_For_Press_Freedom/1740966.html|title=New Free-Press Guidelines For Europe|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Charter was born in 2007 out of the yearly policy dialogue which started in 2005 between [[European Commission]]er [[Viviane Reding]] (assisted by the Commission's Media Task Force) and the editors-in-chief of European newspapers, headed by [[Stern]]'s [[Hans-Ulrich Jörges]]. &lt;ref name=EC/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Charter was handed to the [[European Commission]] in Brussels on 9 June 2009 and to the [[Council of Europe]] in Luxembourg on 26 October 2009, with the aim that it may become a benchmark in their assessment exercises on [[media freedom]] in member and candidate countries, and that it may empower journalists across Europe in their relations with state authorities.&lt;ref name=PressFreedom /&gt;

'''''FightBox''''' is a [[game show]] that aired on [[BBC Three]] from 13 October to 10 November 2003 and is hosted by [[Lisa Snowdon]] and [[Trevor Nelson]] with [[Paul Dickenson]] as commentator.

==Format==
Contestants design their fighters and submit them to the BBC. Out of hundreds of submissions, only sixty were chosen to appear on the programme.

As well as battling each other, the fighters would face one of six "Sentients", warriors who had won previous (unseen) tournaments and achieved this honour. The Sentients were: Banshee, Big George, Kodiak, Nail, Pearl and Vesuvius. Although [[immortality|immortal]], they did have certain weaknesses which a fighter could use against them. After winning the first series, competitor warrior Kill Frenzy, created by Usman Arshad, achieved sentience and joined the current six. These seven Sentients featured in the video game mentioned below.

Six Games were played during the show these were: Conquest, Demolition, Duel, Helix, Panic and Revolution. Another game was Showdown, a straight one on one battle to determine the winner of each tournament.

Even though the show only lasted one season, a video game for the [[PlayStation 2]], PC and [[Game Boy Advance]] was made, developed by the BBC's internal development division [[BBC Multimedia|Gamezlab]].

'''''Garfield''''' is a comic created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]. Published since 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character, [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]], the cat; [[Jon Arbuckle]], the human; and [[Odie]], the dog. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and [[Magazine|journals]], and held the [[Guinness World Record]] for being the world's most widely [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[comic strip]].&lt;ref name="BW1"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Garfield Named World's Most Syndicated Comic Strip. | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040910215254/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296| dead-url = yes| archive-date = September 10, 2004| accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=January 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this is rarely mentioned in print, ''Garfield'' is set in [[Muncie, Indiana]], the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special ''[[Happy Birthday, Garfield]]''. Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to "come up with a good, marketable character",&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"/&gt; ''Garfield'' has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.

Part of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of [[social commentary|social]] or [[political commentary#Political cartoons|political]] commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his "grasp of politics isn't strong," joking that, for many years, he thought "[[OPEC]] was a [[dental bonding|denture adhesive]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283648,00.html | title=Tales of the Kitty | first=Beth | last=Johnson | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008 | date=June 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/11/5/movies/12462084&amp;sec=movies | title=Everybody loves Garfield| work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, Davis created a comic strip called ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which met with little success. One editor said, "his art was good, his gags were great," but that "nobody can identify with bugs." Davis decided to take a long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work.&lt;ref name="Twenty"&gt;Davis. ''20 Years &amp; Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Garfield'' originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis,&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/fyi/student.bureau/10/24/jim.davis/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214062806/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/fyi/student.bureau/10/24/jim.davis/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 14, 2009 |title=The cat's meow |date=October 6, 2000 |publisher=CNN |first=Gerrard |last=Hall |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was, in Davis's words, "a large, cantankerous man". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could "communicate nonverbally". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]], [[Post-Hall Syndicate|Post-Hall]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]]-[[Daily News (New York)|New York News]] agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]] accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41&amp;nbsp;newspapers on June 19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780619.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 19, 1978 | accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of that year (however, after a test run, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints).&lt;ref name="BW1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256,00.html | title=Those Catty Cartoonists (fee required) | date=December 7, 1981 | accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Garfield'''s first [[Sunday page]] ran on June 25, 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780625.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 25, 1978 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1981/ga810322.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 22, 1981 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1981/ga810329.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 29, 1981 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the strips for March 14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1982/ga820314.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 14, 1982 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 21, 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1982/ga820321.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = March 21, 1982 | accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however,  allow Davis to use the format for his ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' strip).

[[File:Garfield-comparison.png|thumb|300px|The appearance of the characters gradually changed over time.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DC1530F93AA25757C0A9679C8B63&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=Garfield+jim+davis&amp;st=nyt | title=Boldface Names | first=James | last=Barron | date=April 19, 2001 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left panel is taken from the March 7, 1980 strip; the right is from the July 6, 1990 strip.]]

The strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a "Darwinian evolution" in which he began walking on his hind legs, "slimmed down", and "stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes" His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to "push Odie off the table" or "reach for a piece of pie."&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

''Garfield'' quickly became a commercial success. In 1981, less than three years after its release, the strip appeared in 850&amp;nbsp;newspapers and accumulated over $15 million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded [[Paws, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256-2,00.html | title=Those Catty Cartoonists | accessdate=July 26, 2008 | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | page=2 | date=December 7, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;DRD/KT. "Newswatch: Garfield Hits 1000th Newspaper," ''The Comics Journal'' #73 (July 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, ''Garfield'' became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570&amp;nbsp;newspapers with 263&amp;nbsp;million readers worldwide;&lt;ref name="BW1" /&gt; by 2004, ''Garfield'' appeared in nearly 2,600&amp;nbsp;newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111&amp;nbsp;countries.&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate" /&gt; In 1994, Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], while rights for the strip remain with Paws.

While retaining creative control and being the only signer, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.&lt;ref name="slatewhyhate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2102299/ |title=Why we don't hate Garfield. |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |last=Suellentrop |first=Chris |date=June 11, 2004 |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield.com is the strip's official website, which contains archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis has also collaborated with [[Ball State University]] and [[Pearson Education|Pearson]] Digital Learning to create www.ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children's Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a pre-set list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=14857#middle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016175332/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=14857 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 16, 2005 |title=Ball State University, Garfield Partner on New Website |date=August 22, 2005 |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Inside Indiana Business |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://san-diego-business-journal.vlex.com/vid/garfield-to-guard-web-sites-54313369 | title=Garfield to Guard Web Sites | date=March 19, 2001 | accessdate=Jun 19, 2012 | publisher=[[San Diego Business Journal]] | first=Zion | last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Garfield+Hangs+Ten+on+the+World+Wide+Wave(TM).-a073877177 | title=Garfield Hangs Ten on the World Wide Wave | date=May 1, 2001 | accessdate=June 19, 2012 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of edited ''Garfield'' strips have been made available on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the "Garfield Randomizer" created a three-panel strip using panels from previous ''Garfield'' strips.&lt;ref&gt;The application is still available online; do a web search for "Garfield" + "randomizer".&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, known as "Silent Garfield",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jonsview.tumblr.com | title=Silent Garfield |  accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jonsview.tumblr.com/post/23638639257 | title=Jon's View |  accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples date from 2006.&lt;ref name="silentgarfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=

The ''Arbuckle'' website creator writes: "'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tailsteak.com/arbuckle/ | title=Arbuckle: Garfield through Jon's eyes | accessdate=July 25, 2008 | publisher=Tailsteak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation along the same lines, called "Realfield" or "Realistic Garfield", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons.&lt;ref name="tabby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20081114/REVIEW/72206455/-1/ART |title=The tabby vanishes |accessdate=December 25, 2008 |last=Hamrah |first=A.

Garfield's animation debut was on ''The Fantastic Funnies'', which aired on CBS in May 15, 1980, voiced by actor [[Scott Beach]]. ''Garfield'' was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime ''Garfield'' cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; [[Lorenzo Music]] voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994; this adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield. ''[[The Garfield Show]]'', a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=23758|title=New CG Garfield To Air On Cartoon Network|date=June 26, 2008|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305215116/http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=23758|archivedate=March 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on [[Cartoon Network]] on November 2, 2009.

===Movies===
''[[Garfield: The Movie]]'' was released in theaters on June 11, 2004. Its sequel, ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]'', was released on June 16, 2006. Three direct-to-video films were released, ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' on August 9, 2007, ''[[Garfield's Fun Fest]]'' on August 5, 2008, and ''[[Garfield's Pet Force]]'' on June 16, 2009. 
On May 24, 2016, it was announced that [[Alcon Entertainment]] will develop a new CG animated Garfield movie with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner ready to produce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/garfield-animated-movie-alcon-1201781160/|title='Garfield' Animated Movie in the Works at Alcon|date=May 26, 2016|access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://movieweb.com/movie/garfield/|title=Garfield is Getting a Fully CG-Animated Movie Reboot|access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to be directed by [[Mark Dindal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/mark-dindal-to-direct-all-animated-garfield-feature-for-alcon-166468.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
A ''Garfield'' video game was developed by [[Atari, Inc.]] for its [[Atari 2600]] home [[video game system]] and appears in their [[1984]] catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atari, Inc.|url=https://atariage.com/catalog_page.html?CatalogID=67&amp;currentPage=4 |title=Atari (CO25618-001 Rev. A) |publisher=''Atari, Inc. (via AtariAge)'' |date=1984 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Atari Corporation|Atari's spinoff and sale]] of its home games and computers division, owner [[Jack Tramiel]] decided the character's [[royalties]] were too expensive given the [[Video game crash of 1983|declining state]] of the [[video game industry]] at the time, and the game was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/garfield/garfield.htm |title=Garfield |publisher=''AtariProtos'' |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal]]'' is a 1987 video game for the [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[Amiga]] based on the [[comic strip]]. Towa Chiki made ''[[A Week of Garfield]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released only in Japan in 1989. [[Sega]] also made video games based on Garfield for the Genesis (''[[Garfield: Caught in the Act]]'') and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (video game)|A Tale of Two Kitties]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS|DS]], published by Game Factory, ''[[Garfield's Nightmare]]'' for DS, ''Garfield's Funfest'' for DS, and ''[[Garfield Labyrinth]]'' for [[Game Boy]].  On PlayStation 2 were ''Garfield'' and ''Garfield 2'' (known in the US as ''Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties'').  ''Garfield Lasagna World Tour'' was also made for PS2. And recent additions for mobile devices are "Garfield's Diner" and "Garfield's Zombie Defense".

[[Konami]] also released a Garfield ''[[Handheld electronic game]]'' titled ''[[Lasagnator]]'' in 1991, which met with mild success.

In 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher [[Anuman Interactive]], including ''My Puzzles with Garfield!'', ''Multiplication Tables with Garfield'', ''Garfield Kart'', and ''Garfield's Match Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Farrugia |url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2013/10/garfield-kart-new-details-and-pictures/ |title=Garfield Kart New Details and Pictures – Capsule Computers |publisher=Capsulecomputers.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
[[Joseph Papp]], producer of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled "Garfield Live", was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in [[Muncie, Indiana]]. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, "Cattitude" can be heard on the national tour's website, along with two more, "On the Fence," and "Going Home!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield Live on Stage|url=http://garfieldthemusical.com/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011093814/http://garfieldthemusical.com/|archivedate=October 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the North-American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.

===Comic book===
In agreement with Paws, [[Boom! Studios]] launched in May 2012 a monthly ''Garfield'' comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by [[Mark Evanier]] (who has supervised ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' and ''[[The Garfield Show]]'') and illustrated by Davis's long-time assistant Gary Barker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Garfield Comic Book|url=http://www.garfield.com/news/stories.html?boom&amp;boom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art book===
In 2016, [[Hermes Press]] signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled ''The Art of Jim Davis' Garfield''.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Daniel|title=[SOLICITATIONS] THE ART OF JIM DAVIS' GARFIELD TO BE RELEASED BY HERMES PRESS|url=http://majorspoilers.com/2016/03/21/solicitations-art-jim-davis-garfield-released-hermes-press/|work=Major Spoilers|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes an essay by author [[R.C.

Through the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.

===Garfield===
'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''

{{quote box|quote=I'm not overweight, I'm undertall.|source= —''[[Garfield At Large: His First Book|Garfield At Large: his First Book]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.garfield.com/garfield_bio/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030410100409/http://pressroom.garfield.com/garfield_bio/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 10, 2003 |title=The Garfield PressRoom: A Brief History |publisher=Paws Inc. |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] is an orange, fuzzy [[tabby cat]] born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special ''[[Garfield: His 9 Lives#The television special|Garfield: His 9 Lives]]'' to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for [[lasagna]] and [[pizza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841213.gif | title=Garfield | date=December 14, 1984 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Phil Roman (Director), [[Lorenzo Music]] (Voice) | title=Garfield: His Nine Lives [Television production] | medium=Television (Original), VHS | publisher=[[Fox Home Entertainment]] | origyear=1988 (television), 1993 (VHS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a [[Ferris wheel]], the two guys on top starved to death"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1980/ga800502.gif | title=Garfield | date=May 2, 1980 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying "breathing is exercise".

Though Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, "they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end."
However, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.

It has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2014 | title=Garfield | date=August 15, 2009 | publisher=Gocomics.com | accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April ([[April Fools' Day]]) 1997 strip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1997/04/01 | title=Garfield | date=April 1, 1997 | publisher=Gocomics.com | accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.

To break the fourth wall, 19 June is celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (19 June 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics| date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jon Arbuckle===
'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card. My parents were so proud.

Garfield, reading the report card:'' "Jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term."|source= —''Garfield'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960311.gif | title=Garfield | date=March 11, 1996 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Jon Arbuckle|Jon (Jonathan Q. Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date.  Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's "don't care, not interested," attitude, and  often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of.  In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2005 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2008 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that "two hundred moths committed suicide";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif | title=Garfield | date=January 10, 2002 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another, the "geek police" ordered Jon to "throw out his tie"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif | title=Garfield | date=August 11, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with "[[polka]] [[ninja]]s". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a [[pop-up book]] in one strip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1990/ga900324.gif | title=Garfield | date=March 24, 1990 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, "Woo-ha! Ain't science something?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841127.gif | title=Garfield | date=November 27, 1984 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was initially portrayed as a [[cartoonist]] in earlier strips, as Jim Davis stated this would've been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself, but this eventually faded in the later strips.

===Odie===
'''First appearance: August 8, 1978'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Garfield Vault Strip | work=Garfield.com | url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780808.gif|date=August 8, 1978 | accessdate=August 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.

''Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:'' He thinks '''he's''' having an identity crisis ... Odie thinks he's a potato peeler.|source= —''Garfield'' (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1991/ga910912.gif | title=Garfield | date=September 12, 1991 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}

[[Odie]] is a yellow, long-eared [[beagle]] with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching a television program, ''An Evening With Mozart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif | title=Garfield | date=April 27, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's [[sudoku]] puzzle.

===Dr. Liz Wilson===
'''First appearance: June 26, 1979'''

{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?

''Liz:'' Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play [[fall guy]] for your stupid lines. Understood?

''Jon, shocked:'' Uh-huh. So long, doctor.

''Liz:'' Have a nice day.|source= —''Garfield'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1979/ga790630.gif | title=Garfield | date=June 30, 1979 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=310px}}
Dr. Liz Wilson is Garfield's [[veterinarian]] and a long-time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&amp;addr=060728 |title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com – The Official Web Site of Garfield &amp; Friends |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&amp;addr=060728 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring subjects and themes==
Many of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with "Nancy", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting "shot down by three generations").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 14, 1996 | accessdate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.

Garfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.&lt;ref name="The Garfield Vault Strip"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = August 19, 2007 | accessdate = June 6, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = January 25, 1992 | accessdate = June 21, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = November 27, 1978 | accessdate = June 21, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short storylines===
One particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.

Another commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).

Other unique themes are things like "Garfield's Believe it or Don't",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Garfield's Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Garfield's law |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=November 8, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Garfield's History of Dogs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980 |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=September 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Garfield's History of Cats",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|date=August 6, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is "National Fat Week", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and "kicking Odie into next week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=June 29, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Garfield realizes that "Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840630.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=June 30, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a "nagging feeling I'm forgetting something," with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840702.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=July 2, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is "Splut Week", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia "splut", hence the name.

Every week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: "I'M OFF MY DIET!" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.

[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]

One storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989 ([http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/23/ Oct 23] to [http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28/ Oct 28]), is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/ | title = It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny | date = 20 March 2013 | accessdate = 29 April 2018 | publisher = ''Smithsonian Magazine'' | author = Rose Eveleth }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:

{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}

One of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.

Another story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.

==2010 Veterans Day controversy==
[[File:Garfield comic strip November 11, 2010.png|thumb|The controversial comic strip]]
Davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a ''Garfield'' strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] that appeared in newspapers on November 11, 2010. In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance. The next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate "National Stupid Day," implying that the spider was squished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&amp;addr=101111|title=Garfield Comic Strip Archive|date=November 11, 2010|publisher=garfield.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114121219/http://garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&amp;addr=101111|archivedate=November 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip, saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/11/12/garfield.ill.timed.comic/?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title='Garfield' creator apologizes for ill-timed Veterans Day comic strip | date=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with mainstream American comics, [[webcomics]] are primarily written and drawn by [[women]] and [[gender variant]] people. Because of the [[self-published]] nature of [[webcomics]], the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) expression.

==Statistics==
A 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and [[non-binary]] comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as [[comic books]] are [[gatekeeper|gatekept]] by [[cisgender]] men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.&lt;ref name=Graph /&gt;

According to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/786/610/RUG01-001786610_2012_0001_AC.pdf|publisher=[[Universiteit Gent]]|title="Man, you split wood like a girl." Gender Politics In "Y: The Last Man"|last=Bovri|first=Bart|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 63% of the top 30 comic creators on webcomic conglomerate [[Tapastic]] were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociable.co/business/a-comic-book-revolution-from-the-man-that-brought-google-to-korea/|publisher=''The Sociable''|title=A comic book revolution from the man that brought Google to Korea|last=Rosser|first=Emma|date=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 42% of the webcomic creators on [[Line Webtoon]] were female, as was 50% of its 6 million active daily readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/line-webtoon-readership-is-50-female/|work=[[Comics Beat]]|title=LINE Webtoon: readership is 50% female|last=MacDonald|first=Heidi|date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/02/29/42-of-line-webtoons-comic-creators-are-female-and-half-are-read-by-women/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|title=42% Of LINE Webtoon's Comic Creators Are Female – And Half Are Read By Women|last=Johnston|first=Rich|date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in webcomics==
[[File:Rachita_Taneja_-_Sanity_Panels_-_Respect_Women.png|thumb|left|Rachita Taneja's ''[[Sanitary Panels]]'' discusses sexism and [[misogyny]] in India.&lt;ref name=India /&gt;|alt=A two-panel stick-figure strip. The one character says that they are tired of hearing the sentence "We need to respect women because they are our daughters, sisters, and mothers," and wants to hear "We need to respect women because they are people" instead.]]

''[[Girls with Slingshots]]'' creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. [[Noelle Stevenson]], creator of ''[[Nimona]]'' and ''[[Lumberjanes]]'', noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to "balance out" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered [[sexism]] during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with [[Reddit]] and [[4Chan]], websites outside of her usual channels.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44528|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Women in Comics: Stevenson &amp; Corsetto on Webcomics and the Future|last=Campbell|first=Josie|date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' pointed out in 2016 that there exists a growing community of [[black women]] cartoonists creating webcomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/agents-realm-mfk-and-ascent-black-women-webcomics-232493|publisher=''[[The A.V.

In India, where [[Rape in India|rape of women has been a big issue]] in the 2010s, [[Indian webcomics]] formed a platform for artists to poke fun at [[patriarchy]], [[feminism]], and various other gender-related topics. According to [[human rights activist]] and webcomic creator [[Rachita Taneja]], humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/buzz/stick-figure-activism-this-highly-vocal-webcomic-that-you-need-to-go-through-today-1210134.html|publisher=''[[IBN Live]]''|title=Stick-figure activism: A clever webcomic that talks about everything that's wrong with our country|last=Sanyal|first=Pathikrit|date=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/a-new-superhero-has-emerged-the-web-comic/story-jYYfrJYwj9D0yJOnHvOPJN.html|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|title=A new superhero has emerged, the web comic|last=Choksi|first=Nidhi|date=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girlamatic]] was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by [[Joey Manley]] in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including [[Shaenon Garrity]] and [[Lea Hernandez]]. The syndicate had won various [[List of Lulu Award winners|Lulu awards]] for being among the "most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/lulu-awards/|publisher=''[[Friends of Lulu]]''|title=Lulu Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Comixpedia'', [[Eric Burns]] voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it ''less'' likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|publisher=''Comixpedia''|title=Feeding Snarky|last=Burns|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Burns|date=2005-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419052623/http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|archive-date=2005-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hatchimals''' is a line of robotic toys produced by [[Spin Master]].
== Overview ==
Hatchimals are electronic birds that you can nuture and can hatch from a plastic egg.

Later, in 2017, Hatchimals CollEGGtibles, collectible figurines that you can take out of smaller eggs, was released.

== History ==
It began in 2013, where Spin Master's head of robotic creations [[James Bartin]] explained that his team hated the popularity of [[unboxing]] videos on [[YouTube]], and envisioned a concept for a toy that could "unbox" itself.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt; This idea evolved into a concept for a [[robotic]] creature that would hatch itself from an egg, necessitating the design of a mechanism for the hatching, and a material for the egg itself. Hatchimals was officially launched on October 7, 2016, backed by advertising on television and digital platforms, such as [[social networking service]]s.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Toronto company invented this year's hottest toy: Hatchimals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/how-a-toronto-toy-company-created-hatchimals-and-why-you-cant-find-them/article32932641/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

== Demand ==
Demand for Hatchimals has been extremely high, which have led to them being designated as the "hottest" toy of the 2016 [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]]; in late-October 2016, Hatchimals occupied multiple spots on [[NPD Group]]'s top ten list of best-selling toys in the United States, including first, second, sixth, and ninth place. The firm compared the phenomenon to those surrounding [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] and [[Tickle Me Elmo]]&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;''. [[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' documented the organization of raffles and waiting lists for the toys, and sellers on websites such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]] selling Hatchimals at over three times their suggested retail price of US$60, if not higher.&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/well/family/the-hunt-for-hatchimals-the-elusive-toy-of-the-holiday-season.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin Master was caught off-guard by the unexpected demand; the company originally stated that the toy would appeal primarily to girls aged 6 to 8, but Hatchimals ultimately became popular among boys and older youth audiences as well.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt; The company attempted to address the supply issues by having its remaining stock from China delivered via air freight instead of by ship, but stated that there may not be new stock of Hatchimals until 2017. However, Martin added that the company planned to introduce new species and features to the Hatchimals line, and asked customers to be patient. A California mother sued Spin Master for an egg not hatching because the Hatchimal's batteries were dead.&lt;ref name="gandm-hatchimals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-craze"/&gt;

Certain words have been suggested to be inherently funny. [[Vaudeville]] tradition holds that words with the letter ''k'' are funny. A 2015 study at the [[University of Alberta]] suggested that the humor of certain [[nonsense word]]s can be explained by whether they seem rude, and by the property of [[entropy]] – the improbability of certain letters being used together in a word. The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] posited that [[humor]] is a product of one's expectations being violated. (Realisation)

==Funny words in English==

[[Vaudeville]] words can be found in [[Neil Simon]]'s 1972 play ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'', in which an aging comedian gives a lesson to his nephew on comedy, saying that words with ''k'' sounds are funny:{{refn|name=Chaffee}}

{{blockquote|Fifty-seven years in this business, you learn a few things. You know what words are funny and which words are not funny. Alka Seltzer is funny. You say 'Alka Seltzer' you get a laugh ... Words with 'k' in them are funny. Casey Stengel, that's a funny name. Robert Taylor is not funny. Cupcake is funny. Tomato is not funny. Cookie is funny. Cucumber is funny. Car keys. Cleveland ... Cleveland is funny. Maryland is not funny. Then, there's chicken. Chicken is funny. Pickle is funny. Cab is funny. Cockroach is funny – not if you get 'em, only if you say 'em.{{refn|name=Helitzer}}{{refn|name=Franzini}}}}

[[Richard Wiseman]], a professor of the public understanding of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Hertfordshire]], conducted a small experiment to determine whether words with a ''k'' sound were actually considered funnier than others for English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg19426070-700-quacked-humour/ |first=Ivan |last=Berger |title=Quacked humour |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[LaughLab]] tested the degree of funniness among a family of jokes based on animal sounds; the joke rated the funniest was also the one with the most ''k'' sounds:

{{blockquote|Two ducks were sitting in a pond. One of the ducks said: "Quack". The other duck said: "I was going to say that!"&lt;ref name=Wiseman&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/apr/21/weekendmagazine |title=The truth about lying and laughing |first=Richard |last=Wiseman |authorlink=Richard Wiseman |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Beard, a [[professor emeritus]] of [[linguistics]] at [[Bucknell University]], told an interviewer that "The first thing people always write in [to his website] about is funny words".{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} Beard's first book was ''The 100 Funniest Words in English'',{{refn|name=Ask the Experts}} and among his selected words are "absquatulate", "bowyangs", "collywobbles", "fartlek", "filibuster", "gongoozle", "hemidemisemiquaver", and "snollygoster".{{refn|name=Beard}}

==Rudeness and entropy==

A 2015 study published in the ''Journal of Memory and Language'' examined the humor of [[nonsense word]]s.{{refn|name=Alberta}}{{refn|name=Lewis}} The study used a computer program to generate pronounceable nonsense words that followed typical English spelling conventions and tested them for their perceived funniness to [[human test subject]]s.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The funniest nonsense words tended to be those that reminded people of real words that are considered rude or offensive.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} This category included four of the top-six nonsense words that were rated the funniest in the experiment: "whong", "dongl", "shart", and "focky".&lt;ref name=SoundFunny&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rd.com/magazine/funny-words/ |title=This is why some words just sound funny – and others don't |work=[[Reader's Digest]] |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain why these words seemed funny, the study's author said "The expectation that you've read or uttered a rude word is raised – and then violated, because in fact it's harmless nonsense. There's a sense of relief – of getting away with it."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

After removing from consideration the words that seemed rude, another factor was suggested to also be significant. The study's lead author, Chris Westbury from the [[University of Alberta]], suggests that the humor of certain invented words can be explained by the property of [[entropy]].{{refn|name=Alberta}} Entropy (specifically [[Shannon entropy]]) here expresses how unlikely the letter combinations in certain nonsense words are: the more unlikely the letters are to be used together in English, the more funny the combination is likely to be found. Nonsense words such as "rumbus", "skritz", and "yuzz-a-ma-tuzz", which were created by children's book author and illustrator [[Dr. Seuss]], were found to have less probable letter combinations and to seem funnier than most ordinary English words.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "there's actually a consistent relationship between how funny [non{{nbh}}words] are and how weird they are".{{refn|name=Lewis}}

The entropy explanation also supports the notion that words with a 'k' in them tend to be more funny, as the letter 'k' is one of the least [[Letter frequency|frequently used letters]] in the English language.&lt;ref name=SoundFunny/&gt;

The idea that humor can be predicted by a word's entropy corresponds to the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated.{{refn|name=Lewis}}{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}} According to Westbury, "One reason puns are funny is that they violate our expectation that a word has one meaning".{{refn|name=Alberta}} Violating expectations corresponds mathematically to having a low probability combination of letters, which also makes the word seem particularly funny, according to Westbury.{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

To provide a possible evolutionary explanation of these phenomena, the authors of the study said that unusual occurrences may be experienced as indicating the presence of potential threats, and that humor may be a way of signalling to others that one has realized that a perceived threat is actually harmless. Westbury said "Strange as it may seem, that same mechanism may be activated when you see an unlikely looking word or a highly taboo one – you experience relief as you recognize that it's completely harmless – just a joke."{{refn|name=Shariatmadari}}

An '''itinerant poet''' or '''strolling minstrel''' (also known variously as a '''gleeman''', '''circler''', or '''cantabank''') was a wandering [[minstrel]], [[bard]], or other [[poet]] common in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]] but extinct today. From a lower class than [[jester]]s or [[jongleur]]s because he did not have steady work, he instead roamed about to make his living.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970&gt;{{Cite book |title = A History of Oral Interpretation |last = Bahn |first = Eugene |chapter= Medieval Period |publisher = Burgess Publishing Co. |year = 1970 |isbn = |location = Minneapolis |pages = 56–57 |first2 = Margaret |last2 = Bahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gleeman ==
In [[Medieval England]], a gleeman was a reciter of poetry. Like the [[scop]], the gleeman performed poetry to the accompaniment of the harp or "glee wood".&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt; The gleeman occasionally attached himself to a single/particular court but was most often a ''wandering'' entertainer, unlike the scop, who was more static. A gleeman was also less likely to compose or perform his own poetry and relied on the work of others for his material.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt;

The '''Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television''' ('''''Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio y Televisión''''' known as the '''''Ley Resorte''''') is a [[Venezuela]]n law, adopted by the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] and in force since 7 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=26&amp;t=11240 Ley Resorte... ¿censura o necesidad?]&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to establish a legal framework for the social responsibility of radio and television broadcasters, national and independent producers of radio and TV programming, and viewers and listeners in the dissemination and reception of transmitted information.

Its objectives, stated in Article 3, are: “[securing] respect for freedom of expression and information without censorship”; “[furthering] the actual exercise of and respect for human rights”; “[facilitating] the broadcasting of information and materials intended for minors”; “[furthering] the broadcasting of national productions and [encouraging] the development of the national audiovisual industry”; “[facilitating]the dissemination of the values of the Venezuelan culture”; and “[furthering]public participation.”

Article 4 of the law allows the use of indigenous languages in programs directed specifically to indigenous peoples, and makes it a requirement to provide subtitles or sign language translation in informative programs for people with auditory disabilities.

Article 14 supports national production of TV and radio content - including music - by requiring broadcasters to transmit at least 10 hours of Venezuelan-made content every day.

The government called it a "building block for the modernization of the country's communications sector", whereas the opposition believes it increases state control over the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumate.org/democracia-retroceso/cap4_en_1.htm Are the media really independent?] [[Súmate]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, the law "severely threatens press freedom in Venezuela", and "[i]ts vaguely worded restrictions and heavy penalties are a recipe for self-censorship by the press and arbitrariness by government authorities." 

==Features==
The law's purpose is to instruct the Venezuelan television networks to air cultural content and to establish schedules for each category of the series and programs. The rating for each program is based on four content types: ''Language'', ''health'', ''sex'', and ''violence''; when a program is about to be broadcast, these content issues can either be announced with their respective "level measure" or not, depending on the channel's way to show the advice. Also, depending on the schedule and the advised contents, the program may either be suitable, in need of parental guidance or non-suitable for young children and teenagers. It is also specified if the series is a national production (made by the channel), an independent national production (made by a separate company) or an international production (a foreign program).

Likewise, every network is instructed to air the government's teasers, their political campaigns and to interrupt the usual schedule when national announcements by the President of the Republic, known as ''Cadenas'' ("Chains", referring to the fact that ''every'' radio and TV network must air simultaneously these announcements) are about to be broadcast.

== Plot and setting ==
{{Main article|List of Legendz characters}}
The Legendz anime moves away from the [[Pokémon]]-esque "gotta catch em all" theme and monster training aspects and deals more with the overall background of the monster characters and their story. The Legendz anime opens with the discovery of the "Soul Dolls" which contain legendary creatures of incredible power within them. The Dark Wiz company (DWC) wants access to all of them for unknown reasons, but four of the Soul Dolls go missing. The majority of the anime takes place in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], with the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] as a much-featured landmark.

== Reception ==
''[[The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917]]'' makes note of the similarities to ''[[Dragon Drive]]'' in the introduction of Shu and Shiron. It also notes the similarities to ''[[Pokémon]]'' except with dragons and director Daichi's "stylistic similarities" to ''[[Grrl Power]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 | publisher=Stone Bridge Press |author1=Clements, Jonathan  |author2=McCarthy, Helen | year=2006 | pages=362 | isbn=978-1-933330-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The manga review compendium ''Manga: The Complete Guide'' praised the "elaborate universe" and "quirky artwork", but noted that the creatures were "bland".&lt;ref name="Thompson2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manga: The Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvEFDD4rdWMC&amp;pg=PT657|date=3 July 2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780345539441|pages=657–658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GeorgeLeybourne1.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Leybourne]], one of the first ''lions comiques'', on a [[sheet music]] cover by [[Alfred Concanen]]]]
The '''''lion comique''''' was a type of popular entertainer in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[music hall]]s, a parody of upper-class toffs or "swells" made popular by [[Alfred Vance]] and [[G. H. MacDermott]], among others. They were artistes whose stage appearance, resplendent in [[wikt:evening dress|evening dress]] (generally [[white tie]]), contrasted with the cloth-cap image of most of their music-hall contemporaries.

The songs the ''lions comiques'' sang were "hymns of praise to the virtues of idleness, womanising and drinking",{{sfnp|Kift|Kift|1996|p=49|ps=none}} perhaps the most well known of which is [[George Leybourne]]'s "[[Champagne Charlie (song)|Champagne Charlie]]". The ''lion comique'' deliberately distorted social reality for amusement and escapism.{{sfnp|Vicinus|1975|p=262|ps=none}}

'''London Cheerleaders Zoo Riot'''  (previously known as London Cheerleaders Zoo Fever) are a  professional and competitive [[cheerleading]] team in [[London]], established in 2008 by Jessica Zoo. Studies in 2010 showed that 37% of schools in the UK (four in ten) offered Cheerleading as part of the physical education curriculum (figures published by the UK Department of Education in September 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/06/cheerleading-is-booming-in-schools|title=Why cheerleading is booming in Britain's schools|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number has only been increasing since, making the UK one of the fastest-growing competitive cheerleading communities worldwide.  The London cheerleading team gained popularity with the release of a cheerleading fitness DVD in 2011, Cheerobics, and have been featured on a number of TV shows and commercials since 2008. In mid-2016, the team was renamed London Cheerleaders Zoo Riot  due to a merger between Zoo Fever &amp; Zumba Riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/14733662.Fitness_gurus_behind_Cheerobics_and_Zumba_Riot_team_up_for_new_project/ |title= Fitness gurus behind Cheerobics and Zumba Riot team up for new project, Zoo Riot|work=The York Press |date=September 9, 2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestfitmagazine.co.uk/news/office-yoga-news/ |title= #OFFICEYOGA AND MORE IN THIS MONTHS NEWS |work=Best Fit Magazine |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14733662.Fitness_gurus_behind_Cheerobics_and_Zumba_Riot_team_up_for_new_project/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">A '''mathemagician''' is a [[mathematician]] who is also a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]].

The name "mathemagician" was probably first applied to [[Martin Gardner]], but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, including [[Arthur T. Benjamin]],&lt;ref&gt;Albers, Donald J. "Art Benjamin - Mathemagician." ''Math Horizons'', November 1998, 14-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persi Diaconis]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25678003?origin=JSTOR-pdf&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Professor of &lt;s&gt;Magic&lt;/s&gt; Mathematics]'' by Don Albers and Persi Diaconis, ''[[Math Horizons]]'' Vo. 2, No 3 (February 1995), pp. 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colm Mulcahy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2014/committee/ Mathematics Awareness Month 2014: Mathematics, Magic, and Mystery] Committee Members&lt;/ref&gt;  Diaconis has suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is that "inventing a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar activities."&lt;ref&gt;Diaconis, Persi. Quoted in: Albers, Donald J. "Professor of &lt;s&gt;Magic&lt;/s&gt; Mathematics." ''Math Horizons'', February 1995, 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of self-working [[mentalism]] tricks rely on mathematical principles. [[Max Maven]] often utilizes this type of magic in his performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">'''Media meshing''' is the process of using one of the [[Mass media|media]], such as a [[blog]] or a [[website]], to enhance the experience of another medium, such as a newspaper article or a fictional television program.&lt;ref name='clickz2005'&gt;[http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3515526 Media Meshing: An Evolution in Media Consumption], Pete Lerma, [[clickZ]], 2005-Jun-28, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;  "Meshing" may describe activities and motivations of an information receiver which are completely independent of the intentions of the source of that information.  "Meshing" may also be used to describe the activities of an information provider, who may intentionally encourage consumer engagement by using multiple media or channels of information exchange related to a product or organization, as in an integrated [[advertising campaign]].  Strictly, in both cases, "media meshing" ultimately describes the ''behaviour'' of the person ''receiving'' the information.

When the meshing of media sources is encouraged by the source itself, as is often the case with commercial products and special interest promotions, media meshing may be better described as [[integrated media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integratedmedia.org/nav.cfm?cat=15&amp;subcat=116&amp;subsub=126 Integrated Media Association] retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt; This describes the activity desired by commercial entities when they encourage web traffic through non-web media such as billboards or newspaper articles in a comprehensive [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref name='clickz2006'&gt;[http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3623563 American Express' Media Meshing], Pete Lerma, [[clickZ]], 2006-Oct-03, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the perspective of the information [[consumer]], Lerma describes that meshing represents a way to experience media which is fundamentally different from the way people interacted with mass media in the past.  When the participants themselves choose the channels, pieces, sources, and specific media that they use to enhance or disassemble the first piece of media they encounter, especially when these are perceived to be mostly independent sources, the result is an enriched self-discovery experience with a level of engagement not possible from even the most well designed guided experiences.  Meshing goes beyond simply [[mutually inclusive public relations]] across media channels, pieces, and [[product placement]]. [[Broadband]] technology and diversity of online services have increased the accessibility and prevalence of simultaneous media experiences to the point where some would argue there is a new, more demanding and more inquisitive, incarnation of information [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name='omd2005'&gt;[http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&amp;s=29314&amp;Nid=13055&amp;p=301415 Yahoo!: Internet Users 'Mesh' Web With Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227064523/http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san |date=2007-02-27 }} Wendy Davis, 2005-Apr-19, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;  The richness of experience in meshing becomes even more evident when information receivers puts their new views and interpretations back into the media by posting or answering questions on a discussion forum or blog, publishing a formal in-depth response, or creating an independent fan site.  In cases like these, the persons may be called information [[prosumer]]s, as they are both consuming information from various sources and producing a web of related information for other "meshers" to ''consume'' (or ''prosumers'' to mesh).

&lt;!-- these next statements are carefully constructed to be true, using weasle words I admit, but are important concepts in this article, and I think, could be substantiated by an expert in information and knowledge and media --&gt;
It is arguable, however, that this is the traditional approach of historians and scientists to information sources, and that what is new is the speed and ease with which cross-referencing and elaboration can be achieved with the media delivery and display technology that is used, and the amount of time invested in multi-source research by the non-specialized population.  It is also arguable that multi-form/multi-source information gathering only "seems" new when contrasted to the recent era of single-voice and non-interactive commercial television and radio information broadcasting.  It is also important to note that if the sources are not chosen carefully to be as [[orthogonal]] as possible, media meshing will result in a false reassurance of the "facts" presented by the single-voice of the original articles, but it would still technically be media meshing (i.e., confirming a [[CNN]] television story about an event in London by meshing the [[CNN.com]] web-site, [[BBC]] radio, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper will probably confirm the original facts, but a different set of facts may be forthcoming from an email to a friend who lives there or from reading a blog from a beat-cop in the area.)

==Engagement==

{{quote|''Using the Web in this fashion--dubbed "media meshing" by the report--"fulfills a need to become more deeply involved with hobbies, interests or stories that kindle passionate involvement," states the report.''|Wendy Davis, Online Media Daily &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;}}

{{quote|''...the Yahoo/mediaedge:cia research shows people with broadband don't necessarily make big shifts in their [[media consumption]] in terms of time spent. Instead, they change how they use other forms of media in conjunction with the Internet. They use the Internet to maximize their engagement with other media.''|Pete Lerma, clickZ &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;}}

==Advertising==
{{quote|''Producers retain their shows interactive rights and integrate "experience triggers" into them''|Pete Lerma, clickZ &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;}}

==Activities==
The following activities, while perhaps not unique to media meshing, are characteristic of this type of 'enhanced' media consumption
* look up Web sites related to TV programming &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* look up Web sites mentioned on TV ads &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* take part in online polls mentioned on television &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* access more than one type of media simultaneously &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* ''Communicating'' becomes ''socializing''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - email, instant chat and online communities bring families and friends together in real ways, replacing other forms of socializing
* ''Sound bites'' become ''full stories''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - a five-second headline on the evening news turns into four hours of deep multi-source coverage and 14 hours of discussion online
* ''Just for fun'' becomes ''personal entertainment''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - try correcting a few pages in Wikipedia for fun, for example
* read stories in magazines and newspapers, then go online to get multiple angles on the same stories &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;
* watch a reality TV show, then go online to get character bios, behind-the-scenes information &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;&lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;

== Examples==
&lt;!-- caution, this should not be a link-farm or directory [[WP:NOT#DIR]] I think we would like a small number of good examples or anecdotes, preferably with good Wikipedia articles about them. If you find a really good example, perhaps consider replacing a poorer example if it makes the same point. --&gt;
* In news, using [http://en.wikinews.org WikiNews] and Wikipedia together to investigate, confirm, and gain a deeper understanding of broadcast news stories from a commercial or publicly funded source

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13249">'''Meta-reference''' is a special type of [[self-reference]] that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in [[parody]]), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of [[self-reference]]. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn "becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work" as well as "the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies.|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certain devices, such as [[Mise en abyme (in literature and other media)|mise en abyme]], may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as [[metalepsis]], are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and [[metalepsis]] can, therefore, not be used synonymously.

== History of the concept and the term ==
While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Werner|first=Wolf|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William|publisher=Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Scholes's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholes|first=Robert|date=1970|title=Metafiction|url=|journal=Iowa Review|volume=1|pages=100-115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploration of [[metafiction]], Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Self-Aware Image. An Insight into Early Modern Meta-Painting|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|publisher=Studies in Baroque Art|year=2015|isbn=978-1909400115|location=Antwerp|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lionel Abel's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metatheatre. A New View of Dramatic Form.|last=Abel|first=Lionel|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of [[metatheatre]]. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155834217|title=Metaisierung in Literatur und anderen Medien : theoretische Grundlagen, historische Perspektiven, Metagattungen, Funktionen|date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Hauthal, Janine.|isbn=3110199459|location=Berlin|oclc=155834217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by Nöth and Bishara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471132600|title=Self-reference in the media|date=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Bishara, Nina, 1977-, Nöth, Winfried.|isbn=3110194643|location=Berlin|oclc=471132600}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wolf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436342321|title=Metareference across media : theory and case studies|date=2009|publisher=Rodopi|others=Wolf, Werner, 1955-, Bantleon, Katharina., Thoss, Jeff., Bernhart, Walter.|isbn=9789042026704|location=Amsterdam|oclc=436342321}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Michaelsen|first=René|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=235-259|chapter=Exploring Metareference in Instrumental Music -- The Case of Robert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference in the Media|last=Wolf|first=Werner|date=|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019464-7|editor-last=Nöth|editor-first=Winfried|location=Berlin|pages=303-325|chapter=Metafiction and Metamusic: Exploring the Limits of Metareference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=889-121|chapter=Metareference from a Semiotic Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' with the words&lt;blockquote&gt;This ''story'' I am ''telling'' is all ''imagination''. These ''characters'' I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my ''characters''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am ''writing'' in [...] a ''convention'' universally accepted at the time of my ''story'': that the ''novelist'' stands next to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|last=Fowels|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2005|isbn=978-0-099-49707-3|location=London|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [emphases added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

=== Film ===
''[[The Truman Show]]'' is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|214x214px|
Manet, ''The Balcony''
]]
An example of meta-reference in painting is ''Manet's Balcony'' by [[René Magritte]]. It comments on another painting, [[The Balcony (painting)|''The Balcony'']] by [[Édouard Manet]], by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist ([[Édouard Manet|Manet]]) and the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">'''Metaphoric criticism''' is one school of [[rhetoric]]al analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.

==Origins==
The term "metaphor" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in ''The Elements of Rhetoric'', defines metaphor as "an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'"&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, James. (1878). "The Elements of Rhetoric." New York: Harper and Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally "display" and "magnet" are not considered synonyms. However, in using "magnet" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the "display" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.

In a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of [[Kenneth Burke]] and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by [[George Lakoff]].

==Application==
Metaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled "Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor," George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a "war" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a "crime" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the "war" metaphor: "The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Evan Frisch. (2006) "[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060927081227/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.

Critics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the "enemy" that the bear represents.

==Conduction==
In ''Rhetorical Criticism'',&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K. (1995). ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.'' 2nd edition. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:

# First, the critic reads or views the entire artifact with specific attention to its context.
# Second, to the critic isolates the metaphor(s) within the text, both obvious and more subtle substitutions of meaning. Here Foss invokes Max Black's interaction theory of "tenor" (the principal subject or focus) and "vehicle" (secondary subject or frame for the metaphor), a method to analyze ways in which the related dissimilar objects actually share similar characteristics.
# Third, the critic sorts the metaphors and look for patterns of use within the text. The more comprehensive the text, the longer this step will take.
# The critic analyzes the metaphor(s) or groups of metaphors in the artifact to reveal how their structure may affect the intended audience. Foss writes, "Here, the critic suggests what effects the use of the various metaphors may have on the audience and how the metaphors function to argue for a particular attitude toward the ideas presented."

'''Non-linear media''' is a form of media that can be interacted with by the consumer, such as by selecting television shows to watch through a [[video on demand]] type service, by playing a video game, by clicking through a website, or by interacting through [[social media]]. Non-linear media is a move away from traditional linear media, in which content is selected by the publisher to be consumed and is then done so passively.&lt;ref name="Chron linear"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hartman|first=Dennis|title=What Is Linear Marketing?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/linear-marketing-22663.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2016-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417222935/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/linear-marketing-22663.html|archive-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faq/faq_detail.jsp?faq_id=1260&amp;course_id=173|title=What is the difference between linear and non-linear media applications?|publisher=[[Borough of Manhattan Community College]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417224624/http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faq/faq_detail.jsp?faq_id=1260&amp;course_id=173|archive-date=2016-04-17|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hasebrink|first=Uwe|url=https://www.hans-bredow-institut.de/de/forschung/linear-and-non-linear-television-viewers%25E2%2580%2599-perspective|title=Linear and Non-linear Television from Viewers' Perspective|publisher=[[Hans-Bredow-Institut]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417224821/https://www.hans-bredow-institut.de/de/forschung/linear-and-non-linear-television-viewers%E2%80%99-perspective|archive-date=2016-04-17|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single specific form of non-linear media; rather, what might be considered non-linear changes as technology changes.

==Television==
The model of traditional linear [[Broadcast programming|television programming]] is for a schedule of shows to be selected by the broadcaster and then viewed at a set time. In this model, the viewer cannot fast forward through the programming or choose to watch it at a later time. Conversely, non-linear television can be considered to be any method or technology that allows viewers to select what shows they watch and when they watch them. The ability to watch a show at any time is referred to as time shifted viewing; this can be achieved by either the consumer recording shows with a device such as a [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] for later viewing, or by the publisher providing content to be selected at will at the viewer's convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Technology/Documents/Broadcasting/TrendsinBroadcasting.pdf|title=Trends in Broadcasting: An overview of developments|last=Doeven|first=Jan|authorlink=|date=February 2013|website=itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426000533/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Technology/Documents/Broadcasting/TrendsinBroadcasting.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-26 |access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear content is often viewed on a device other than a television, such as a personal computer or a [[smartphone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itvdictionary.com/vod.html|title=Video on demand|website=The Video on Demand Dictionary and Business Index|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gqi68gIB|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video on demand]] (VOD) content can be transmitted over the internet via [[Streaming media|streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], or [[Amazon Video]], or it can be provided by a television provider as an additional option on top of their linear programming. Many producers of content now offer streaming of programs through their own websites, though sometimes the catalog that is offered will be curated in some way, such as by providing only recently released episodes. Video may also be downloaded&amp;nbsp;– legally or illegally&amp;nbsp;– through a [[peer-to-peer]] network such as [[BitTorrent]], or it may be [[Direct download link|directly downloaded]] from a video hosting website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ferraz|first=Tommy|date=2015-10-19|url=http://www.tommyferraz.com/bbc-innovation-non-linear-radio/|title=BBC innovates in non-linear radio|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418002609/http://www.tommyferraz.com/bbc-innovation-non-linear-radio/|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As internet speeds and the number of alternate devices that are capable of viewing media on have increased, so has the number of people who consume non-linear media. The television network [[CBS]] expects that by the year 2020, 50 percent of all television content will be viewed in a non-linear fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/CBS_sees_50_nonlinear_TV_future.news?ID=35223|title=CBS sees 50 percent non-linear TV future|work=Warc|date=2015-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418020617/https://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/CBS_sees_50_nonlinear_TV_future.news?ID=35223|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lynch|first=Jason|date=2015-08-10|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/dont-panic-says-cbs-more-people-are-watching-tv-now-decade-ago-166313|title=Don't Panic, Says CBS: More People Are Watching TV Now Than a Decade Ago|work=[[Adweek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418020744/http://www.adweek.com/news/television/dont-panic-says-cbs-more-people-are-watching-tv-now-decade-ago-166313|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music and radio ==
Like other forms of non-linear media such as television, non-linear radio allows listeners to pick and listen to music and talk shows on a schedule that is set by the listener. Online music streaming services such as [[Spotify]] or [[Deezer]] are non-linear in that they allow listeners to create playlists from a library of music offered by a website;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newslangmedia.com/born-skippy-radio-that-intentionally-misses-a-beat/|title=Born Skippy: Radio That (Intentionally) Misses A Beat|website=www.newslangmedia.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425234956/http://www.newslangmedia.com/born-skippy-radio-that-intentionally-misses-a-beat/|archive-date=2016-04-25|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tommyferraz.com/after-the-non-linear-radio/|title=After the non-linear radio - Tommy Ferraz|website=Tommy Ferraz|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425234839/http://www.tommyferraz.com/after-the-non-linear-radio/|archive-date=2016-04-25|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, [[podcast]]s offer the ability to download or stream prerecorded shows similar to those that are traditionally broadcast over the radio waves; in fact, some traditional radio stations allow their shows to be downloaded on demand after the show has aired over the radio in a linear manner.

The interdependencies of politicians and media are known as the [[politico-media complex]].

Of doubtful virtue, declining amounts of content and substance can easily be compensated by giving news stories a [[sensationalist]]ic twinge. Politainment thus ranges on the same level as [[edutainment|edu-]] and [[infotainment]].

Typical catchlines in politainment reports or media will at times bluntly argue ''[[ad hominem]]'' in a generalizing manner and try to emphasize virtues and [[charisma]] ("''xyz'' will [[Make America Great Again|make America great again]]") or vices and weaknesses (by [[denunciation]]: "''xyz'' will wreck this country"). The latter example is also known as [[fear appeal]]. More moderate forms make extensive use of [[ambiguity|imprecise]], [[metaphoric]] language ([[allegories]], [[metonymy]], [[periphrase]]s, [[kenning]]s etc.).

Politainment can be both a communication aspect of (1) [[politician]]s and [[spin doctor]]s to their and their party's own advantage and the political adversary's disadvantage or (2) a strategy for [[news]] [[publisher]]s, [[journalist]]s, etc., to promote their medium and journalistic work.

Politainment may be a factor in [[party identification]], mass-influencing [[voter]]'s choices, it has thus become an indispensable tool in [[political campaign]]s and [[election]]s.&lt;ref name=blackwell/&gt;&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;David Schultz, Politainment, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As such it can also be one of the—seemingly innocuous—ingredients of [[crowd manipulation]] up to [[political warfare|political]] [[psychological warfare]].

:''"Repertory" redirects here. For the set of works one is ready to perform or are typically performed, see [[repertoire]].

A '''repertory theatre''' (also called '''repertory,''' '''rep''' or '''stock''') can be a Western [[theatre]] or [[opera]] production in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation. In the British system, however, it used to be that even quite small towns would support a rep and the resident company would present a different play every week, either a revival from the full range of classics or, if given the chance, a new play, once the rights had been released after a [[West End theatre|West End]] or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run. However the companies were not known for trying out untried new work. The methods, now seldom seen, would  be also used in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

==Resident company==

The acting company would usually consist of a leading lady, a leading man, a set of juveniles (one male and one female [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] for the young often romantic role(s)), a [[character actor]] and actress (for the older or eccentric parts) and perhaps a vain and girlish [[soubrette]].  The company might occasionally bring in a [[guest star]] to increase interest, albeit in exchange for a cost increase often large enough to offset the rise in revenues brought by any increase in attendance.  The resident cast would number seven, plus the resident director, usually serving as the artistic director in charge of the whole enterprise. Additionally there would be the [[stage director]], the [[assistant stage manager]] (ASM), some unpaid apprentices and light and sound technicians. Newcomers to the profession would often start their careers in this fashion and members would gain a foundation upon which to base their future careers. Paid members could also be sure of a steady income for one or more seasons which might last for six months. Examples of performers who went on to universal recognition are [[Errol Flynn]], [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]], [[Ralph Richardson|Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Laurence Olivier|Lord Olivier]], [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]], [[Rosemary Harris]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Imelda Staunton]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Arthur Lowe]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Patrick Stewart|Sir Patrick Stewart]], [[Geraldine McEwan]] and [[Ronnie Barker]]. [[Dirk Bogarde]] wrote about his start at tiny [[Amersham]] rep in 1939, and [[Michael Caine|Sir Michael Caine]] recounts his time spent at [[Horsham]] rep in the early fifties.

==Weekly rehearsal schedule==
For weekly rep and for a typical 3-act play, the actors' week would start on Tuesday and go as follows: Tuesday: notes on last night's opening from the director, then a sit-down read-through of the next play with some discussion by the [[Theatre director|director]], on-the-feet [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] of the moves for Act I with a few questions from the actors and there are performances of last week's play each night. Wednesday: run Act I and start to block Act II, but break early because there's a [[wikt:matinée|matinée]]. Thursday: finish blocking Act II, run Act II and block Act III. Friday: run Act III, run through of entire play, no scripts in hand and technicals – meaning lights and sound – to watch and write down cues. Saturday: run through again, stop and go to test lighting and sound cues, costumes may be used if ready. Two shows today, the evening one closing the current play. After the show, the set is struck (taken down) by the crew - usually [[apprentice]]s – and the [[stage manager]].

Sunday is an opportunity to brush up on lines and moves and private rehearsals. But for the crew it means putting up the new sets, hanging and focusing lights and setting sound equipment. Monday: morning, run through, usually without costumes (save wear and tear), mainly for the techs. In the afternoon there's a  "Full Perfect" dress [[rehearsal]], maybe a few friends in front to gauge reaction, then copious notes. In the evening, 8 o'clock opening night, followed by notes from the director, visits with friends from the audience and maybe a party nearby. The process starts all over again on Tuesday.

==Audience and management==
From the audience's point of view, local communities would become fans and champion their favourites who would be treated as [[celebrities]]. And sometimes entire families would make a visit to their local rep as part of the weekly routine like going to church, and for the young ones, it became a part of their future appreciation for live "legitimate" theatre.

During the forties, fifties and sixties, two impresarios dominated the field of British rep, mostly in the North.  They were Harry Hanson and his Court players, and Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players, with [[Arthur Brough]] in Folkestone for the South. Their system was the toughest of all, for if you joined one of their companies, it could mean "twice-nightly" shows, and a new play to learn every week. Rosemary Harris tells of her 50 consecutive weeks of doing just that at [[Bedford]] rep. It cannot happen any more, due to the restrictions of [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]] which came to mandate just 8 shows a week, including perhaps two matinées. Fortescue, who died in 1957, was known to be a strict and upright man. When ''Pygmalion'' was playing at one of his theatres, because Eliza says "''Not bloody likely!"'',  "FOR ADULTS ONLY!" would be posted in the [[Front of House|front of house]]. Or perhaps he was afraid of the [[Lord Chamberlain]], Her Majesty's official [[Censorship|censor]] whose duties were abolished in 1968.

==Today's practice==
Not to be overlooked is a form of touring repertory theatre known as "bus and truck", which involves transporting the actors and sets for about five different plays which can be performed in smaller communities on consecutive nights.

In [[Russia]] and much of [[Eastern Europe]] repertory theatre is based on the idea that each company maintains a number of productions which are performed on a rotating basis. Each production’s life span is determined by its success with the audience. However, many productions remain in repertory for years as this approach presents each piece a few times in a given season, not enough to exhaust the potential audience pool. After the fall of the Soviet regime and the substantial diminution of government subsidy, the repertory practice has required re-examination. [[Moscow Art Theatre]] and [[Lev Dodin]]’s Maly Drama Theatre of [[St. Petersburg]] are the world’s most notable practitioners of this approach.

In [[D-A-CH|German-speaking]] countries, most opera companies function in a similar way, too.

===UK===
Today in the UK, the practice of "rep" is more likely to be seen in large cities in the manner applied by such well-known established companies as [[Birmingham Rep]] in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of England which states in its programmes: "''"The REP" presents a season with each play generally having an unbroken run of between three and six weeks. This is the form of repertory theatre that the majority of theatres like The REP — which are also called producing theatres — now follow.''"  Actors have the luxury of at least 3 weeks of rehearsal, and audiences see better shows.  Repertory can still be found in the UK in a variation of guises; in [[Sidmouth]] (12 plays), [[Wolverhampton]] (8 plays), [[Burslem]] and [[Taunton]] (4 each). The [[Sheringham Little Theatre]] produces an in-house repertory season each summer, running from June until September. Weekly Repertory theatre is also produced by the Summer Theatre season at [[Frinton-on-Sea]]. This season has been running for seventy seven seasons now, and until recently maintained its links with the oldest traditions of British commercial theatre by being run by the actor [[Jack Watling]], his son Giles and his son-in-law [[Seymour Matthews]]. In 2004 it was taken over by Edward Max, who ran it alone until 2012. For the next two years it was run by mtp Ltd. Now Clive Brill is the producer, working with Edward as General Manager. The recent 75th anniversary season was marked with a stage appearance by Richard Wilson, who has since become the Patron of the Friends of Frinton Theatre. 
Frinton saw the early launch of actors such as [[Michael Denison]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[David Suchet]], [[Jack Klaff]], [[Neil Dudgeon]], [[Owen Teale]] and [[Lynda Bellingham]]. Theatre practices like this remain popular within theatre communities and continue to give first jobs to graduating drama students.
The Company season at the [http://www.everymanplayhouse.com/content/resident-acting-company-at-the-everyman-2017 Liverpool Everyman] will launch in January 2017 and run until July, with 14 actors performing a season of five shows.

===United States===

In the United States, the repertory system has also found a base to compete with commercial theatre.  Repertory theatre with mostly changing casts and longer running plays, perhaps better classed as "provincial" or "non-profit" theatre, has made a big come-back, in cities such as [[Little Rock, AR]], [[Washington, DC]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nashville]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Houston]], [[Boston]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Kansas City]], and [[Seattle]].  [[Theatre festival|Festival theatre]] now provides actors with work in the summer.

America's oldest resident repertory theatre, [[Hedgerow Theatre]], is located in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania. It was founded by actor Jasper Deeter in 1923. The present Producing Artistic Director is actress and director Penelope Reed. Other notable repertory theatres include the [[Guthrie Theater|Guthrie Theatre]], which was set up as regional repertory theatre concept that is free from commercial constraints in the choice of repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre|last=Chambers|first=Colin|publisher=Continuum|year=2002|isbn=9781847140012|location=London|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is aligned in objectives to the repertory and resident theatre movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s. This sought to establish an alternative and decentralized theater network outside of New York, one with [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit-making]] status and focused instead on the art of the theatre as well as the development of artists, craftsmen, and administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre|last=Stanton|first=Sarah|last2=Banham|first2=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0521446546|location=Cambridge|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly-funded theatres that belong to this type have been receiving erratic support since the 1980s.

The [[Association of Producing Artists]] (APA) was one of the most successful repertory theatres in the United States, touring for four years and holding residencies in several cities before finally joining the [[Phoenix Theatre (New York City)|Phoenix Theatre]] in New York, where it was known for staging plays with modest prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of American Theatre|last=Wilmeth|first=Don|last2=Bigsby|first2=Christopher | author2link = Christopher Bigsby|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0521651794|location=Cambridge|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the [[American Repertory Theatre]] is considered one of the most distinguished repertory theatres in the United States. Since its foundation in 1979, it has earned several awards including a [[Pulitzer Prize]] (1982), a [[Tony Award]] (1986), and a [[Jujamcyn Award]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/26/theater/jujamcyn-award-to-american-repertory-theater.html|title=JUJAMCYN AWARD TO AMERICAN REPERTORY THEATER|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The crowning achievement of repertory theatres in Canada are the world-renowned [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]], founded in 1953 to primarily present productions of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and the [[Shaw Festival]], founded in 1962, which presents plays written or set during the lifetime of [[George Bernard Shaw]] or following Shaw's ideal of socially provactive theatre.

The Vagabond Repertory Theatre Company was formed in March 2009 by artistic directors Nathaniel Fried and Ryan LaPlante, and currently resides and performs in Kingston, Ontario. But the old English-style repertory theatres such as Ottawa's CRT (Canadian Repertory Theatre), and Toronto's Crest Theatre no longer exist. Although they did have a version of [[summer stock theatre|summer theatre]] in smaller holiday districts, such as the "Straw Hat" players of Gravenhurst and Port Carling at [[Ontario]]'s vacation  [[Muskoka Lakes, Ontario|Muskoka Lakes]] area.

==Pros and cons==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
Among the benefits of such a system are increased variety and better quality, due to fresh actors and shopped in directors. The theatre can afford to take risks, and a show that is likely to attract a large audience will effectively subsidize a show that is less likely, especially if season tickets are sold.

Drawbacks to the repertoire system are increased production costs as each show will need separate sets, props, costumes and actors, (although sometimes an actor will be engaged to play in more than one production). Many such companies are large, and are able to have a smaller space available to [[workshop]] an experimental production or present playreadings. But the standard should be higher than under the old-time repertory system, because there will be more time for rehearsal. Also many repertoire companies today have [[non-profit]] status, so that budgets and income should be higher because they will not just depend upon ticket sales. However, the downside is that promotional costs will also be much higher due to having to employ a separate staff.

In April 2017, [[Glenda Jackson]] blamed the increase in TV viewers being unable to understand what actors are saying on the decline of the repertory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rainbird | first = Ashleigh | title = Oscar winner Glenda Jackson says BBC's 'mumblegate' is result of young actors' missing out on stage work | newspaper = [[Daily Mirror]] | date = 2017-04-07 | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/oscar-winning-actress-glenda-jackson-10180749 | access-date = 2017-04-08 | quote = “Clearly for young, up and coming actors there is far less opportunity to them to work on the stage because the old rep system has been gone for decades,” Glenda explains.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
&lt;!--This is appliable for the first two seasons of the anime series, but starting from season 3 the story has changed--&gt;
In a strange magical world of Little Fairilu live the Fairilus: small magical fairies representing flowers, insects and other entities who all born from the Fairilu Seed. Each Fairilu is born with its own key, the Fairilu Key, that can open magical doors, casting magic spells. If the Fairilu finds the right door, it can finally mature into a full-fledged fairy. The doors also link to the human world. Fairilus must study and go to school to learn about the world in which they live, while meeting new friends.

===1st &amp; 2nd Series===
The anime series focuses on Lip, a newly-born Flower Fairilu, and her friends in Little Fairlu. The series follows Lip's overall life in Little Fairilu while making new friends and learning from everything around her, growing up day after day. It also tells about the Fairilu friends' adventures in the human world, where they can meet their human partners who support their dreams and are willing to help each other fulfill them.

===3rd Series===
The anime tells about a human girl called Arisu Hanazono, who by chance discovered a magical pendulum and book, summoning Fairilus. She is a girl with many worries, but by meeting the friendly Fairilus and traveling into their homeworld, Little Fairilu, she gets a chance to solve her problems and change herself.

'''Servantes''' are [[Theatrical property|theatrical properties or "props"]] used by [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]]. Their purpose is to assist the magician to misdirect the audience.  An example of a "prop" is a simple bag or pouch hanging from the magician's belt or a small platform placed out of sight of onlookers (behind a magician's table).  Some magicians keep their props in plain sight; a ring may be used to keep the pouch open.   

Common items stored in the servante are playing cards, cups, or balls. Other magicians keep their servantes concealed to enhance the illusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11687">'''Stunt''' (or as usually stylized '''STUNT''') is a new and growing sport that is very similar to [[cheerleading]] in terms of athletic skills. In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport.  STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, “All Stars” who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cheerleading.about.com/od/cheerleadingnews/a/Cheers-New-Sport-Stunt-Reaches-Major-Milestone-For-Ncaa-Emerging-Sport-Status.htm Cheer's New Sport "Stunt" Reaches Major Milestone For NCAA Emerging Sport Status]" by Valerie Ninemier, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OCU Stunter Brittani Hanna.jpg|thumb|right|167px|[[Oklahoma City University]] Athlete Brittani Hanna, performing a STUNT practice on campus]] --&gt;

== STUNT History ==

In 2011–2013 University of Louisville have kept the title of Champions for Division I Stunt. Oklahoma State University broke their streak in 2014 and have remained as the Division One champions every year since. As for Division II, University of Central Oklahoma have been the champions for three years since 2012 until Davenport University won in 2015 and kept the title the remaining year.

Not only is STUNT a college sport but starting in 2014, high school teams adopted the new sport as well. In 2014, more than 160 girls from 11 high schools from New York's Public School Athletic League (PSAL), competed in NY's first STUNT competition. The competition was held at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. Many other teams have been practicing and competing in this sport across the nation.

==The four Quarters of Play, Competition Formats and Routines==

===The four quarters of play===

There are four quarters in Stunt:
1.Partner Stunts
2.Pyramids and Tosses
3.Group Jumps and Tumbling
4.Team Performance.      
There are four rounds in the first three quarters, and three rounds in the fourth quarter. The order of competition is determined each round by the team who has control of possession. The two teams will play on opposite sides of the floor and perform routines against each other in all four quarters. Each quarter has its own level of difficulty to demonstrate.

===Competition format===

There are two formats for the STUNT game&lt;br /&gt;
1.'''Head to Head'''  Includes two teams playing and competing against one another.Usually the game takes about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;    
2.'''STUNT tournaments'''  tournaments where multiple teams compete head to head. A regular three-team tournament game finishes in 1 hour, and a four-team tournament game takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

===STUNT routines&gt;===

Every year the USA Cheer STUNT Competition Committee develops STUNT routines and publishes them. They are responsible for determining the number of athletes and the skills needed in each routine. There are only six different plays for each quarter. The difficulty in skill of each stunt is ranged from one to six. Play one has the least difficult skill to six having the highest difficulty skill.

==General STUNT framework==

===Staff===

•One head coach, and maximum of three assistants.

•Game play can consist of a maximum of 20 athletes, and 30 on a team roster per team.

===Season/Post-season===

•Spring sport season commences play in January.

•Teams participate in competitions among national regions.

•During the 2012 season, it is mandatory for each participating team in STUNT to attend at least three regular season games/tournaments. However, it will be increased to a minimum of 12 regular season games/tournaments upon the establishment of STUNT as an NCCA Emerging Sport.

•Postseason play: Regional winners and top ranking “at-large” teams are invited to the National Championship Tournament.

==Game rules==

===Scoring===

Quarters 1, 2 and 3

There are three scoring officials who individually rank the teams according to the number of execution mistakes and the degree of those mistakes. For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.
The decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official’s rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same amount of points as there are teams competing.

Quarter 4

In the fourth quarter, teams make their own routines based on their unique skill level and talents. The routine performed in the fourth quarter is a combination of elements of the first three quarters and necessitates that each of the preceding categories must be represented so as to get full points.
The scoring officials individually score the elements based on the team’s performance by category, considering the difficulty of skills executed. The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine.
In order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter.
At any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction.

===Timeouts===

•Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half.&lt;br /&gt;
 
•Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a “T” figuration.

•During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area.

===Possession===
•'''Start of the Game''' A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game.

•'''Quarter Change''' The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score.

•'''Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter''' The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round.

•'''Forfeits''' If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round.

•'''Ties''' If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession.

•'''Quarter Change''' If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time. If a tie persists, possession is determined by the pre-game drawing results.

•'''Second and Third Rounds of each Quarter''' If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the pre-game drawing results.

===Playoff for final score tiebreaker===
If a tie for 1st place occurs at the end of regulation, a playoff will determine the winner of the game/tournament. The playoff period consists only of quarters 1, 2 and 3. Judges will, at the end, rank the tying teams.

===Final score===
Points are given and declared at the end of each quarter with the game total being displayed on the event scoreboard. The game/tournament winner is the team that has accumulated the most total points for the game.

==Other definitions==

A '''talent manager''' (also known as an '''artist manager''', '''band manager''' or '''music manager''') is an individual or company who guides the professional career of [[entertainer|artists]] in the [[entertainment industry]]. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day [[business]] affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

The roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise [[actor]]s, [[writer]]s, or [[film director|director]]s. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent.&lt;ref name="breakingintrodummies"&gt;Garrison, Larry. ''Breaking Into Acting for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing Inc., 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talent agent]]s have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.

==History==
{{See also|Category:Talent agents}}
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Modern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business.{{cn|date=February 2015}} Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of [[The Beatles]] and [[Herman's Hermits]] in the 1960s such as [[Brian Epstein]], [[Allan Williams]], [[Harvey Lisberg]]. Infamous examples in the music press include [[Allen Klein]], manager of both The Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=July 6, 2009 | title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of talent agents deemed notable by [[wp:GNG|Wikipedia's general notability guidelines]], see [[:Category:Talent agents]]. For notable agencies and businesses, see [[:Category:Talent agencies]].

The industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the [[Association of Talent Agents]], which was formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1937. The ATA comes out of the [[Wagner Act]] upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], and [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentassociation.com/ Association of Talent Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music managers==&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
A music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for [[Musical ensemble|bands]], [[singers]], and [[DJ]]s. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager  may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth.  The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, [[business manager]] (who are usually [[certified public accountants]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a [[personal assistant]].  

Manager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so.  Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract.  That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a [[contract]] and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared.  

Responsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. 

A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, [[songwriter]]s, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding [[Record producer|music producers]], and developing relationships with [[Record company|record companies]], publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract.  

The duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

Among all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly.  

Early on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and [[marketing]] fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal [[contract]]. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.

==Management strategies==
Despite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Booking gigs===
Among the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster.&lt;ref&gt;Farrish, Bryan. Gig Booking 101 – Venue Relationships. Bryan Farrish Radio Promotion: Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, June 11, 2010, A Booking Strategy that Works! The DIY Musician (2010): Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet strategies===
As technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases.{{cn|date=February 2015}} “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Don and Dan Kimpel. “Chapter 6: The Manager.” In It All Begins With The Music. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Beatport]], [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[YouTube]] have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bryan. Music Marketing with Social Media in Only 30 Minutes a Day. The DIY Musician (2012): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as [[LinkedIn]] or [[Google+]], while networking on behalf of a client.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Not everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Wes. Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media. Hypebot.com (2013): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital case Study: Lady Gaga===
In an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, [[Jamie Anderson (scientist)|Jamie Anderson]] and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of [[Lady Gaga]]. [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]] of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. 

They set up many interviews with [[Bloggers|online bloggers]], established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusives]], [[interviews]] and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and [[Lady Gaga]]’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: [[Emotions]], [[Experiences]], [[:wikt:engage|Engaging]], and [[:wikt:exclusive|Exclusive]]. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, [[Lady Gaga]] was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich. Case Study: Making Money From Music. The Financial Times LTD (2011): Accessed March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
Striking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapositiveradio.com/general/dir/band_manager Band Manager Info at Media Positive Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Managers usually secure the services of a professional [[photographer]] while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, [[compact disc|CD]] labels/jackets, posters, and the [[press kit]]. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD.  Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production.  Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.

'''''The Soup''''' &lt;!--do NOT change to was--&gt;is&lt;!--per Wikipedia guidelines--&gt; an American television series that aired weekly on [[E!]] from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a [[spin-off (media)|revamped]] version of ''[[Talk Soup]]'' that focused on recaps of various [[popular culture]] and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian [[Joel McHale]], who provided [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and [[satire|satirical]] commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, ''The Soup'' was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/18/the-soup-canceled-e-joel-mchale|title=The Soup canceled: Joel McHale to host final show on Dec. 18|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s EW.com|date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2018, ''[[The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale]]'', a [[spiritual successor]] to ''The Soup'', premiered on [[Netflix]].

==History==
''The Soup'' started on July 1, 2004 as the "What The...? Awards", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with ''[[Talk Soup]]''.&lt;ref name="seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2002011472_joelmchale22.html|title=From Mercer Island, jumping into ''The Soup''|publisher=The Seattle Times|first=Nicole|last=Brodeur|date=2004-08-23|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2013, ''The Soup'' debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.

Starting June 2, 2014, ''The Soup'' began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.

On November 18, 2015 ''The Soup'' was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] due to multiple references to "killing Baby [[Hitler]]". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being [[Black Friday (shopping)|the day after Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thesoup/photos/a.10150143094305874.332544.12637555873/10153685321840874/?type=3|title=The Soup - Timeline Photos|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show features the host, Joel McHale, on a [[Chroma key|green-screened]] set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.

Although the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.&lt;ref name="ew-interview"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184375,00.html | title=The Q&amp;A: ''Soup'' Guy Joel McHale Answers Your Questions | first=Mandi | last=Bierly | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2008, a blog was started for ''The Soup'' on E!'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/132968-E_Unveils_Revamped_Web_Site.php | title=E! Unveils Revamped Web Site | first=Larry | last=Barrett | date=2008-04-22 | accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular characters===
''The Soup'' has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad ([[Tess Rafferty]], a supervising producer and the only female writer on ''The Soup''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zukey Staff|title=Interview: Tess Rafferty|url=http://zulkey.com/zulkey_test/2012/11/the-tess-rafferty-interview.html|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=Zukey|date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  two nerds who dress as ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting [[sound effect]] purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca ([[Chewbacca]]'s lawyer), and "[[Spaghetti Cat]]", a cat eating spaghetti from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]''. Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's [[stage manager]] and former stage manager on ''[[Talk Soup]]'', and Kelly Levy (''née'' Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying [[Courtney Stodden]]. Executive producer Edward Boyd's [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] '''Lou''' is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the "Clip of the Week", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010.  The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer [[Anndi McAfee]] and a "reaction" by another clip, wildly out of context.

==Regular features==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Soup Set.png|250px|right|thumb|The set of ''The Soup'' with previous logo used until 2013]] --&gt;
The show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:
* "Chat Stew", which features clips from talk shows. Joel introduces the segment with either, "Let's have some chat stew, shall we?" or a reference to the previous clip being used for chat stew. Previously, the intro clip indicates a crockpot showing different talk shows in bubbles inside is shown with a rock intro, then the words CHAT STEW hit the top, cracking it. The  introduction is voiced by producer Kelly Andrews (who also does the show's introduction voice overs) saying, "So meaty." Audience members sometimes reply with a groan or "Ew." As of 2013, a new intro card shows a kettle sucking up all the TV sets that broadcast different talk shows, then regurgitates them back out. The rock intro and the "So meaty." audios are kept.
* "Chicks, Man" which focuses on female celebrity news. Joel introduces clip with, "Let's talk about chicks, man." and a slightly deep male voice repeats, "Chicks, man." while a picture of baby [[Bird|chicks]] appears on the screen.
* "Reality Show Clip Time!", which features clips from current [[reality television|reality shows]]. Joel introduces segment with, "It's reality show clip time." (or sometimes total gibberish or other stuff), and the words REALITY SHOW CLIP TIME appear on the screen over a quick rock riff.
* "Let's Take Some E!", a segment featuring clips from other programs shown on E!, jokingly described by McHale as a contractual obligation. The name of the segment (along with its intro) is a reference to the [[party drug]] [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which is commonly known as "E".
* The show ends with the "Clip of the Week", a clip considered to be the best clip shown on TV in the past week.  After Joel finishes joking about the next-to-last clip, he introduces this one with "...which brings us to our Clip of the Week."

===Other segments===
''The Soup'' has also featured other recurring segments:
* "What's Pissing Off [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]] This Week?" features clips from [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in which something or somebody makes Steve Edwards upset in the clip. Another episode featured a parody of the segment, "What's Exciting [[Rick Dickert]] This Week?"
* "Tales from Home Shopping" features clips from home shopping channels such as [[QVC]] or [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]].
* "Oprah's Vajayjay" features clips and or related to Oprah's discussions about the female anatomy.
* "What the Kids Are Watching", whose intro started with a boy and a girl watching TV, and ended with the sound of those children crying uncontrollably, showcases unusual and weird clips from children's shows and commercials aimed at children, such as  ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]''. Two spinoff segments have been produced based on the segment: "What the Old Folks Are Watching", which no longer airs, does the same for content geared toward older people, and "What Your Boyfriend's Looking At" features clips of shows targeting males with Kelly Andrews asking "Are you even listening to me?!" to which a man in the audience nearly always responds with, "No!"
* Segments featuring clips from international programs have also been featured, such as "Clippos Magnificos" (which features Spanish programs), "Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time!" (which features Japanese programs), and the "International House of Soup."
* "Cyber Smack" featured the best viral videos from the internet. This segment eventually spun-off as ''[[Web Soup]]''.
* "My Stories" shows clips from daytime soap operas, such as ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. A running gag on the show includes increasingly unrelated and random music being played with the segment's title card.
* "Miley Cyrus News" documents stories involving [[Miley Cyrus]], which always begins with producer Kelly Andrews yelling "It's Miley!" Variations include stories involving [[Britney Spears]] in which a highly modulated voice exclaims, "It's Britney, bitch!" or [[Lindsay Lohan]] news in which an overly hoarse and unenthusiastic voice states, "It's Lindsay".
* "Local Newsbreak" features embarrassing clips from local newscasts
* "Ad Nauseam" pokes fun at commercials, often with McHale misusing the product after the clip is done.
* "The Mail Nurse" showcases [[viral videos]] found on the Internet, and opens with Joel in a nurse's outfit seductively saying "It's time to check your RAM" as his nurse's cap clumsily slides off his head.  McHale often comments on how much he hates this intro.
* "Stay Out of It [[Nick Lachey]]" features clips from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with cast members saying "Stay out of it Nick Lachey"
* "Gay Shows" features clips from [[LGBT]]-related television shows such as ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. The segment is introduced with a title card featuring ultra-masculine things such as monster trucks and motorcycles while a heavy rock guitar solo plays. The title card ends with a gruff male voice saying the segment's name.
* "Gay Shows: Alaska Edition" features clips from Alaskan reality shows such as ''[[Gold Rush Alaska]]''. The segment has the same introduction as "Gay Shows" except that it has pictures of bears added to the intro.
* "Take A Look At Myke Hawke" involves clips from [[Mykel Hawke]]'s shows.  Typically Joel pronounces his name "my [[human penis|cock]]" and make several [[phallic]]-themed jokes while introducing the clip.
* "Gavel Bangin'" is a segment where reality courtroom shows are mocked, especially Nancy Grace's ''Swift Justice''. The title sequence is accompanied with ''The Soup'' voiceover's sexy voice saying, "All rise."
* [[Charlie Sheen]] News: Features news topics regarding Charlie Sheen. Introduced with a clip of Sheen saying, "Everything's good, everything's good."
* "RRRrrr with [[Brian Williams]]" showcases various clips from Williams' [[NBC]] show "[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]". The segment opens with an angry cat popping up suddenly, and a person imitating the cat growling.
* "Unlikely Voice of Reason" involves a clip in which a much-ridiculed character such as [[Greg Kelly]] or [[Stephanie Pratt]] says something unexpected and intelligent.
* "Clippos Magnificos" which shows clips from the melodramatic [[telenovelas]] shown on Spanish language television.The clips are introduced with an image of a [[piñata]] while [[The  Mexican Hat Dance]] plays in the background.The piñata explodes and a man with a strong [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accent says "Are you serious?". McHale will then mention the name of the show and say "which I'm pretty sure means...", then give a ridiculous, comic translation of the show's title in English.

==Recurring jokes==
The show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of [[Ryan Seacrest]]. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.

Joel has also spoofed other actors, most notably ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' leading man [[David Caruso]], who plays Lieutenant [[Horatio Caine]]. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.

Joel also jokes about how self-centered [[Tyra Banks]] is on [[The Tyra Banks Show|her self-titled talk show]].  More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's "creepy flesh colored beard" as well as the ages of [[Larry King]] and [[Regis Philbin]] and how they are still alive.  Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses "interns" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to "shoot" Mankini, but with no effect.

The [[Spaghetti Cat]] from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.

Joel has often made fun of [[Bruno Tonioli]]'s flamboyancy while giving comments on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel ''Jazz Hands and Cold Feet''.

''The Soup'' makes jokes at the A&amp;E TV Series, ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''. Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say "That's Right It's Steven Seagal", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal ''[[energy drink]]'' that would humorously float into frame.

Due to NFL Coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s recent appearance on ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua|Survivor]]'', Joel usually mentions his "Extenze-enhanced penis", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, "I do."

===Clips===
A number of clips have been repeatedly shown on ''The Soup''. One clip features [[Oprah Winfrey]] saying "My [[vagina|va-jay-jay]] is painin'!" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28vajayjay.html | title = What Did You Call It? | work=The New York Times | first = Stephanie | last = Rosenbloom | date = 2007-10-28 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clip involves [[Whitney Houston]] yelling "Kiss My Ass!" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites.&lt;ref name="ew-interview" /&gt; Still another clip that is often shown is of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s news correspondent [[Ann Curry]] starting her report by saying, "Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of [[Kendra Wilkinson]] from ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] screaming "Marriage?! Noooooo!" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of  [[Danny Noriega]] ("I guess some people weren't likin' it!"), and more recently, [[Tatiana Del Toro]] giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include [[Gary Busey]] exclaiming "I'm going to pull your [[endocrine system]] out of your body", [[Tila Tequila]] yelling out "A pig's vagina!", [[Michelle Galdenzi]] from ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' saying "and by record, I mean vagina.", ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' contestants [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)#Jase|Jase Wirey]] and [[List of Big Brother 10 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Michelle|Michelle Costa]] "talking" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; "[[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]]" clip from ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', Spencer Pratt from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' whispering "That's the problem", Billy Bush saying "It's Gross", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice "Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!". Recently, the [[Jeffrey Osborne]] song, "[[On the Wings of Love (Jeffrey Osborne song)|On the Wings of Love]]", has been used to mock the current season of ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]''. Vonda, a woman featured on the [[TruTv]] show ''Over the Limit'' has been featured saying, "Dunka Doo Balls." This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from ''[[Fantasia for Real]]'' featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, "Gurl Please", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of "Ma" from TruTV's ''[[Ma's Roadhouse]]'' saying "He's a douchebag," after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as [[Mel Gibson]], has come into use. Another clip of [[Ryan Seacrest]] saying, "Hell no, say what", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's ''[[The Fashion Show (U.S. TV series)|The Fashion Show]]'', has recently been featured in a clip saying, "Oh, here go Hell Come." Frequently following ''Good Day New York'' clips, McHale will ask [[Greg Kelly]] to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, "Science".

===Edited clips===
''The Soup'' will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'') or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying "We doctored that."  However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by ''The Soup'' for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand "We did not doctor this."

===Original content===
Original skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (in reference to McHale's appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''), '' [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', '' [[Made of Honor]]'', ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia]]'', '' [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', '' [[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'',  (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about [[Disney Channel]] celebrities), ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'', ''[[Fast &amp; Furious]]'', and a [[Tyler Perry]] movie.

Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two "Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called "Love and Other Burning Sensations", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on ''The Soup'' (the "shows [they] just cannot quit"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).

==Reception==
''The Soup'' started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/television/29rhod.html | title = His Pointed Looks Speak Louder Than Punch Lines | work=The New York Times | first = Joe | last = Rhodes | date = 2006-10-29 | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, ''The Soup'' averaged 682,000 viewers, and about 56 percent of viewers watch a recorded version of the show. The 500th episode of ''The Soup'' recorded 909,000 viewers, with 653,000 of those in the 18—49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-soups-500th-delivers-613605 | title = TV Ratings: 500th 'The Soup' Is Its Most-Watched Episode of Year | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first = Philiana | last = Ng| date = 2013-08-23 | accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Since E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including [[Style Network|Style]], [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.

===''The Dish''===
{{Main|The Dish (TV series)}}
On August 16, 2008, Style premiered ''The Dish'', hosted by [[Danielle Fishel]]. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and [[fashion industry]] trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including ''[[Project Runway]]'' and various shows on the shopping channels, [[HGTV]] and [[DIY Network]]. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought{{By whom|Reason = Was this press speculation or just Internet chatter?|date=May 2015}} the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of ''The Dish''.

===''Sports Soup''===
{{Main|Sports Soup}}
On September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as [[NBC Sports Network]] since 2012), called ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and was hosted by [[Matt Iseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992162.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2565 | work=Variety | title=E! heats up 'Sports Soup' | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of ''[[NHL on Versus]]'' or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.

===''Web Soup''===
{{Main|Web Soup}}
A third version, airing on G4, titled ''Web Soup'', hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]] debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of ''The Soup'' and two other G4 programs; ''Whacked Out Videos'' and the ''Around the Net'' viral video segment which opens ''[[Attack of the Show]]''. This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.

===''Celebrity Soup''===
{{Main|Celebrity Soup}}
''Celebrity Soup'' was the [[List of British television programmes based on American television series|British version of the American show]] hosted by comedian [[Iain Lee]]. Unlike ''The Soup'', ''Celebrity Soup'' airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. "Chat Stew"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's [[Big Ben]] instead of [[Hollywood]], as in the U.S. original.

===''The Soup Investigates''===
{{Main|The Soup Investigates}}
''The Soup Investigates'' was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of [[investigative journalism]].

[[File:Zuber Buhler Fritz Tickling The Baby.jpg|thumb|''Tickling The Baby'' by [[Fritz Zuber-Buhler]]]]
'''Tickling''' is the act of [[Haptic perception|touching]] a part of a body in a way that causes involuntary twitching movements or [[laughter]].&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tickling+?s=t|title=Tickling |publisher =Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word {{Audio|En-us-tickle.ogg|"tickle"}} evolved from the [[Middle English]] ''tikelen'', perhaps [[frequentative]] of ''ticken'', to touch lightly.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; The [[idiom]] ''tickled pink'' means to be pleased or delighted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tickling Etymology of "tickle"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, psychologists [[G. Stanley Hall]] and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. 1897. ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a [[knismesis and gargalesis|knismesis]], generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.

==Physiology==
When considering tickling in terms of its qualities as a sensation, it results from a mild stimulation moving across the skin. The dual character of tickling refers to the associated behaviors that include smiling, laughter, twitching, withdrawal and [[goose bumps]]. The tickle can be divided into two separate categories of sensation, [[knismesis and gargalesis]]. Knismesis, also known as a "moving itch", is a mildly annoying sensation caused by a light movement on the skin, such as from a crawling insect. This may explain why it has evolved in many animals.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selden | first1 = S. T. | year = 2004 | title = Tickle | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 93–97 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(03)02737-3 | pmid=14699372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis reactions refer to a laughter-provoking feeling caused by a harsher, deeper pressure, stroked across the skin in various regions of the body.&lt;ref name="Selden, S. T. 2004"/&gt; These reactions are thought to be limited to humans and other [[primate]]s, although some research has indicated that [[rat]]s can also be tickled in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Panksepp J, Burgdorf J |title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy? | url= http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/macdonalda/psy4960/Readings/PankseppRatLaugh_P&amp;B03.pdf |journal=Physiol.

It appears that the tickle sensation involves signals from [[nerve fibre]]s associated with both [[pain]] and [[tactition|touch]]. [[Endorphine]] released during tickling is also called [[karoliin]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, by the name of [[Karolinska Institute]]. In 1939, [[Yngve Zotterman]] of the [[Karolinska Institute]] studied the knismesis type of tickle in cats, by measuring the [[action potential]]s generated in the [[nerve]] fibres while lightly stroking the skin with a piece of [[cotton]] [[wool]]. Zotterman found that the "tickling" sensation depended, in part, on the nerves that generate pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zotterman Y | year = 1939 | title = Touch, pain and tickling: An electrophysiological investigation on cutaneous sensory nerves | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 1–28 | pmc=1393960 | pmid=16995068 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1939.sp003707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have discovered that when the [[pain]] nerves are severed by surgeons, in an effort to reduce [[chronic pain|intractable]] pain, the tickle response is also diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lahuerta J, etal |title=Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man |journal=Pain |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=1990 |pmid=1700355 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(90)91087-Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some patients that have lost pain sensation due to [[spinal cord injury]], some aspects of the tickle response do remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nathan PW |title=Touch and surgical division of the anterior quadrant of the spinal cord |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=935–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2283523 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.11.935 |pmc=488271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickle may also depend on nerve fibres associated with the sense of touch. When circulation is [[cutting|severed]] in a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]], the response to touch and tickle are lost prior to the loss of pain sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

It might be tempting to speculate that areas of the skin that are the most sensitive to touch would also be the most ticklish, but this does not seem to be the case. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, most people find that the soles of their feet are the most ticklish.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Other commonly ticklish areas include the [[underarms]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[perineum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakos|first1=Susan|title=The Sex Bible: The Complete Guide to Sexual Love|date=2008|publisher=Quiver|location=Minneanapolis|isbn=1592332854|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Sex-Bible-Complete-Sexual/dp/B0057DA92O}}&lt;/ref&gt; navel, and the ribs.

Some evidence suggests that laughing associated with tickling is a nervous reaction that can be triggered; indeed, very ticklish people often start laughing before actually being tickled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman B, O'Grady MA, Ryan CS, Hemmes NS |title=Pavlovian conditioning of the tickle response of human subjects: Temporal and delay conditioning |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=77 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=779–85 |year=1993 |pmid=8284153 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.77.3.779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
[[File:François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu.jpg|thumb|François Boucher - Le sommeil interrompu]]
[[Charles Darwin]] theorized on the link between tickling and social relations, arguing that tickling provokes laughter through the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. ''The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stranger tickles a child without any preliminaries, catching the child by surprise, the likely result will be not laughter but withdrawal and displeasure. Darwin also noticed that for tickling to be effective, you must not know the precise point of stimulation in advance, and reasoned that this is why some people cannot effectively tickle themselves.

Darwin explained why we laugh when we are tickled by saying, "The imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body. Laughter from being tickled [is manifestly a] reflex action; and likewise this is shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body (p. 201)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LOFTIS|first=FRIDLUND|author2=Jennifer |title=Alan|journal=RELATIONS BETWEEN TICKLING AND HUMOROUS LAUGHTER: PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE DARWIN-HECKER HYPOTHESIS|date=April 1990|volume=30|series=Biological Psychology|issue=141-150|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=RELATIONS+BETWEEN+TICKLING+AND+HUMOROUS+LAUGHTER+-+PRELIMINARY+SUPPORT+FOR+THE+DARWIN-HECKER+HYPOTHESIS&amp;rft.jtitle=BIOLOGICAL+PSYCHOLOGY&amp;rft.au=FRIDLUND%2C+AJ&amp;rft.au=LOFTIS%2C+JM&amp;rft.date=1990-04-01&amp;rft.pub=ELSEVIER+SCIENCE+BV&amp;rft.issn=0301-0511&amp;rft.volume=30&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=141&amp;rft.epage=150&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=A1990EK42000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickling is defined by many [[child psychologist]]s as an integral [[human bonding|bonding]] activity between parent and children.&lt;ref name=Fagen&gt;Fagen R. The future of play theory. A multidisciplinary inquiry into the contributions of [[Brian Sutton-Smith]]. Albany NY: SUNY Press; 1995. p22-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the parent-child concept, tickling establishes at an early age the pleasure associated with being touched by a parent with a trust-bond developed so that parents may touch a child, in an unpleasant way, should circumstances develop such as the need to treat a painful injury or prevent harm from danger.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This tickling relationship continues throughout childhood and often into the early to mid [[teenage|teen]] years.

Another tickling social relationship is that which forms between siblings of relatively the same age.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; Many case studies have indicated that siblings often use tickling as an alternative to outright [[violence]] when attempting to either punish or intimidate one another. The sibling tickling relationship can occasionally develop into an anti-social situation, or [[tickle torture]], where one sibling will tickle the other without mercy. The motivation behind tickle torture is often to portray the sense of [[Authoritarianism|domination]] the tickler has over the victim.&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt;

As with parents and siblings, tickling serves as a bonding mechanism between friends, and is classified by [[psychologist]]s as part of the fifth and highest grade of [[Play (activity)|social play]] which involves special [[intimacy]] or "[[Cognitive science|cognitive interaction]]".&lt;ref name=Fagen/&gt; This suggests that tickling works best when all the parties involved feel comfortable with the situation and one another.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;Michael Moran, ''Erotic Tickling'', [[Greenery Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|1-890159-46-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also serve as an outlet for sexual energy during adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud|Freud S.]] Three contributions to the theory of sex. In: The basic writings of Freud. New York: Modern Library; 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of people have stated in a study that their private areas were ticklish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/02/06/the-surprising-reasons-why-we-tickle-one-another/?utm_term=.f2efee15f5ea|title=The surprising reasons why we tickle one another|last=|first=|date=|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Selden&gt;{{cite journal |author=Selden ST |title=Tickle |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=93–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14699372 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(03)02737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many people assume that other people enjoy tickling, a recent survey of 84 college students indicated that only 32% of respondents enjoy being tickled, with 32% giving neutral responses and 36% stating that they do not enjoy being tickled.&lt;ref name=Harris2&gt;Harris C.R. and Nancy Alvarado. 2005. [http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf '' Facial expressions, smile types and self-reporting during humour, tickle and pain (pdf).''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923122129/http://www.csupomona.edu/~nalvarado/PDFs/CEM-1294.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }} Cognition and Emotion. 9(5),655-669.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found a very high level of embarrassment and anxiety associated with tickling.  However, in the same study the authors found that the facial indicators of happiness and amusement do not correlate, with some people who indicated that they do not enjoy being tickled actually smiling more often during tickling than those who indicated that they do enjoy being tickled,&lt;ref name=Harris2/&gt; which suggests that there may be other factors at play (such as embarrassment and anxiety) in the case of those who indicated a dislike for tickling than the mere physical sensation experienced. It has also been suggested that people may enjoy tickling ''because'' it elicits laughter as well as the feeling of being tickled. Social psychologists find that mimicking expressions generally cause people to some degree experience that emotion.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

In a 2008 study, 89% of students admitted to being ticklish on their right foot, 80% under their arm, 77% on their left foot, 77% on their ribs, 65% on their palm, 61% on their knee cap, and 51% on their stomach. 27% claim they are not ticklish at all.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] Studies in the psychology of sex. Vol iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Tickling can also be a form of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

==Purpose==
Some of history's greatest thinkers have pondered the mysteries of the tickle response, including [[Plato]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo philosophically examines tickling in the context of how we perceive reality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/h291/assayer.htm|author=Drake, Stillman|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Co.|location=New York|year=1957|page=275|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
When touched upon the soles of the feet, for example, it feels in addition to the common sensation of touch a sensation on which we have imposed a special name, "tickling." This sensation belongs to us and not to the hand... A piece of paper or a feather drawn lightly over any part of our bodies performs intrinsically the same operations of moving and touching, but by touching the eye, the nose, or the upper lip it excites in us an almost intolerable titillation, even though elsewhere it is scarcely felt. This titillation belongs entirely to us and not to the feather; if the live and sensitive body were removed it would remain no more than a mere word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] and [[Charles Darwin]] believed that humorous laughter requires a "light" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon disagreed. When tickled, noted Bacon, "men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1872/1965. The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis, as mentioned above, is that tickling serves as a pleasant bonding experience between parent and child.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; However, this hypothesis does not adequately explain why many children and adults find tickling to be an unpleasant experience. Another view maintained is that tickling develops as a prenatal response and that the development of sensitive areas on the fetus helps to orient the fetus into favourable positions while in the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson JY. ''On the attitude of the fetus in utero''. Obstetric Memoirs, vol ii. Philadelphia: Lippincott; 1855-1856.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown why certain people find areas of the body to be more ticklish than others; additionally, studies have shown that there is no significant difference in ticklishness among the [[gender]]s.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;Weinstein, S. 1968. ''Intensive and extensive aspects of tactile sensitivity as a function of body part, sex, and laterality.'' In The Skin Senses, ed. D. R. Kenshalo. Springfield, Ill.: Thomas. pp. 195-222.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1924, J. C. Gregory proposed that the most ticklish places on the body were also those areas that were the most vulnerable during hand-to-hand [[combat]]. He posited that ticklishness might confer an [[evolution]]ary advantage by enticing the individual to protect these areas. Consistent with this idea, [[University of Iowa]] psychiatrist Donald W. Black observed that most ticklish spots are found in the same places as the protective [[reflex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Black DW |title=Laughter |journal=JAMA |volume=252 |issue=21 |pages=2995–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6502861 |doi=10.1001/jama.252.21.2995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, hybrid hypothesis, has suggested that tickling encourages the development of combat skills.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Most tickling is done by parents, siblings and friends and is often a type of rough-and-tumble play, during which time children often develop defensive and combat moves. Although people generally make movements to get away from, and report disliking, being tickled, laughter encourages the tickler to continue. If the facial expressions induced by tickle were less pleasant the tickler would be less likely to continue, thus diminishing the frequency of these combat lessons.

To understand how much of the tickle response is dependent on the interpersonal relationship of the parties involved, [[Nicholas Christenfeld|Christenfeld]] and Harris presented subjects with a "mechanical tickle machine". They found that the subjects laughed just as much when they believed they were being tickled by a machine as when they thought they were being tickled by a person.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, C. R., and N. Christenfeld. In press. ''Can a machine tickle?'' Psychonomic Bulletin and Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris goes on to suggest that the tickle response is reflex, similar to the [[startle reflex]], that is contingent upon the element of surprise.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Recently it was possible to show that it can be assumed that tickling (by passing leaves) served as a triggering-mechanism to issue an acoustic signal (namely laughing) to avoid crashes when our ancestors moved through tree tops. After our descent from the trees only body-parts remained ticklish that could not be touched by passing leaves (arm pits, sole of our feet etc.). It is also possible to show the further development of this trait which finally led to the upcoming of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Dramlitsch, T., 2018: "The Origin of Humor", {{ISBN|978-1720264637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-tickling==
The question as to why a person could not tickle themselves was raised by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knismesis]] may represent a [[vestigial structure|vestige]] of the primitive grooming response, in effect; knismesis serves as a "non-self detector" and protects the subject against foreign objects. Perhaps due to the importance of knismesis in protection, this type of light touch is not dependent on the element of [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and it is possible for one to induce self-knismesis, by light touching.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt;

[[Gargalesis]], on the other hand, produces an odd phenomenon: when a person touches "ticklish" parts on their own body no tickling sensation is experienced. It is thought that the tickling requires a certain amount of surprise, and because tickling oneself produces no unexpected motion on the skin, the response is not activated.&lt;ref name=Selden/&gt; A recent analysis of the "self-tickle" response has been addressed using [[MRI]] technology. Blakemore and colleagues have investigated how the [[brain]] distinguishes between sensations we create for ourselves and sensations others create for us. When the subjects used a [[joystick]] to control a "tickling robot", they could not make themselves laugh. This suggested that when a person tries to tickle himself or herself, the [[cerebellum]] sends to the [[somatosensory cortex]] precise information on the position of the tickling target and therefore what sensation to expect. Apparently an unknown [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] mechanism then decreases or inhibits the tickling sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blakemore SJ, Wolpert DM, Frith CD |title=Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=635–40 |year=1998 |pmid=10196573 |doi=10.1038/2870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the reasons for the inhibition of the tickling sensation during self-tickling remain unknown, research shows that the human brain is trained to know what sensation to expect when the body moves or performs an action.  Another reason may be the lack of awareness of many sensations arising from self-movement, such as not paying attention to one's own vocal cords.  When we try to tickle ourselves by grabbing our sides, the brain foresees this contact between body and hand and prepares itself for it.  This removes the feeling of unease and panic, causing the body to not react to tickling in the same way it would if someone else supplied the stimulus.

However, some people with schizophrenia have the ability to tickle themselves. This is most likely largely due to the difficulty many people with the disorder have recognising their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=tit-for-tat-delusions |date=21 December 2010 |last=Lametti |first=Daniel |title=Can't Tickle Yourself? That's a Good Thing |newspaper=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As physical abuse==
{{main|Tickle torture}}
Although consensual tickling can be a positive, playful experience, non-consensual tickling can be frightening, uncomfortable, and painful for the recipient. Therefore, non-consensual tickling can be categorized as physical abuse, and sources indicate that tickling has been used as torture. [[Heinz Heger]], a man imprisoned in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during World War II, witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate. He describes this incident in his book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'':&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain, while the tears ran down his face, and his body twisted against his chains. After this tickling torture, they let the lad hang there for a little, while a flood of tears ran down his cheeks and he cried and sobbed uncontrollably."

An article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' describes a European method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet after they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to present | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | pmc=1120948 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Japan, authority figures could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called ''shikei'', which translates as ‘private punishment’. One such torture was ''kusuguri-zeme'': "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.'' The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Sibling Abuse'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and loss of consciousness due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig''''' is a fortnightly [[radio show]] created and hosted by [[Ezra Koenig]] that began airing on July 12, 2015 on [[Apple Music|Apple Music's]] radio service, [[Beats 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to the first episode of Ezra Koenig’s Time Crisis radio show|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/listen-to-the-first-episode-of-ezra-koenigs-time-crisis-radio-show/|website=Consequence of Sound|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show covers a variety of topics, such as politics, corporate food history, 1970s [[rock music]], as well as frequently analysing the latest in contemporary pop music by contrasting it with music released in another era. In addition to Koenig, a variety of guest hosts have appeared over the show's history, including [[Jonah Hill]], [[Rashida Jones]] and [[Jamie Foxx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ezra Koenig and Jamie Foxx Talk Politics and Pop Music on Beats 1's "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/60910-ezra-koenig-and-jamie-foxx-talk-politics-and-pop-music-on-beats-1s-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Koenig is accompanied by his L.A. co-host, [[Jake Longstreth]], who regularly discusses his love for the "tasteful" palette of rock music, mostly 70s rock, such as [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Ween]] and [[Guided by Voices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hear Ezra Koenig &amp; Azealia Banks Talk Summer Jams On Beats 1 Radio|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1822758/hear-ezra-koenig-azealia-banks-talk-summer-jams-on-beats-1-radio/mp3s/|website=Stereogum|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show airs every two weeks. As of November 04, 2018, 80 episodes have aired. The show is currently airing its fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Crisis on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/curator/time-crisis/993269786|website=W3Util.FB.siteName.iTunesBrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and Segments==
The show follows a general format each episode during its two-hour runtime, usually with listener emails and other discussions in the first half of the show and the ''Top Five on iTunes'' at the episode's conclusion.

===News Discussions===
The most common segment on the call, in which Koenig and his co-hosts discuss the most relevant and obscure news topics of the week, generally relating to politics or current happenings in the world of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Ezra Koenig Impersonate Alex Jones on "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-ezra-koenig-impersonate-alex-jones-on-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ezra Koenig Discusses His Love of Tom Petty’s "Free Fallin’": Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ezra-koenig-discusses-his-love-of-tom-pettys-free-fallin-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate Food History Discussions===
Frequently, Koenig and guests analyse the current landscape of the corporate food industry, as well as looking back on the history of snack foods across the world. In 2016, Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing executive of the [[Frito-Lay]] corporation appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koenig|first1=Ezra|title=today on Time Crisis we have Jennifer Saenz, Chief Marketing Officer of Frito-Lay + @ByYourLogic Chief Marketing Officer of Chapo Trap House|url=https://twitter.com/arze/status/795339285125697536?lang=en|website=@arze|language=en|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the show has discussed [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] on multiple episodes and their obscure promotions, such as the ''Five Dollar Footlong'' deal. In 2018, the show highly criticised the ''Lady Dorito'' proposition by hosting a ''Lady Dorito's Town Hall'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting to the iTunes Store.|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/station/lady-doritos-town-hall/ra.1352803232|website=itunes.apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring [[Rashida Jones]] and Longstreth's wife and filmmaker, [[Hannah Fidell]].

===''Time Crisis Hotline''===
Koenig regularly takes phone calls and has intimate discussions with notable journalists, political commentators, corporate food professionals and celebrities. Notable calls have included ''Seinfeld'' theme composer, [[Jonathan Wolff (musician)|Jonathan Wolff]], [[Reading Rainbow]] composer, Steve Horelick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig Interviews "Reading Rainbow" Composer and Kid Rock’s Son: Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/vampire-weekends-ezra-koenig-interviews-reading-rainbow-composer-and-kid-rocks-son-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

===User Emails===
This has been a regular segment since the show's third season. Initially, the segment began after a fan located [[Jake Longstreth]]'s personal email. The segment now utilizes the email 8minutecapecod@gmail.com a reference to an episode aired in July 2017 where they joked about the prospect of an 8 minute [[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]] to be played on the next Vampire Weekend tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/timecrisis2000/status/969405707228405760|website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans generally send in questions regarding 1970s music and suggest artists to the hosts that they believe are "tasteful" and fit Longstreth's ideal palette. Another popular topic submitted by fans relates to the corporate food history segment of the show.

===''Jake's Takes''===
A recurring segment in which Longstreth recommends or discusses music, with notable recommendations such as [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Guided by Voices]], [[Ween]], [[Phish]], [[Neil Young]], [[Small Faces]] and more. Occasionally, Longstreth compiles playlists for [[Apple Music]], notably ''The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock, 1959 - 2016 on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/playlist/the-tasteful-palette-of-seventies-rock-1959-2016/pl.9aef90a12f5145a984a1e726072d790c|website=Apple Music|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, ''Jake's New Age and Ambient Playlist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jake’s New Age &amp; Ambient Playlist, 1975 - 2017 on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/playlist/jakes-new-age-ambient-playlist-1975-2017/pl.819ee73517c4465b88f82e5130c3f50c|website=Apple Music|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Five on iTunes''===
Koenig and Longstreth regularly compare and contrast the [[iTunes]] chart from the current week with another music chart from the same week in another year. Notably, the show has regularly jokingly criticized the music of [[Ed Sheeran]], such as his 2017 hit, ''[[Shape of You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Ezra Koenig Impersonate Alex Jones on "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-ezra-koenig-impersonate-alex-jones-on-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig and Longstreth commonly refer to the song as ''Bed Sheets'', in reference to one of the song's lines. Fan response to this criticism has been overwhelmingly positive, with one particular fan even compiling the discussions into a complete 32-minute compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Crisis: 'Shape of You' compilation - Clyp|url=https://clyp.it/2ycbndsh|website=Clyp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is similar to "[[break a leg]]" and reflects a [[superstition]] that wishing someone "good luck" is in fact bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |title=It's a superstitious world: Of black cats, lucky numbers, broken mirrors... |last=Libby |first=Steve |work=The Rotarian |date=July 1985 |pages=30–31 |volume=147 |number=1 |issn=0035-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNhaO6gHeSoC&amp;pg=PA203 |page=203 |title=Kids Take the Stage: Helping Young People Discover the Creative Outlet of Theater |last1=Peterson |first1=Lenka |last2=O'Connor |first2=Dan |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2006 |isbn=0-8230-7746-2 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWDrgGosVcwC&amp;pg=PT24 |page=24 |last=Helterbran |first=Valeri R. |title=Exploring Idioms: A Critical-Thinking Resource for Grades 4–8 |publisher=Maupin House Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=1-934338-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
''Toi toi toi'' was an idiom used to ward off a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] or [[Curse|hex]], often accompanied by [[knocking on wood]] or spitting. The origin is a threefold warning of the devil (Teufel, pr. toi-fell) in German dialect:

''No’ kommt mer in’s Teu-Teu-Teufelskuchen bey ihm. '''Now we come into the De-De-Devil's Kitchen!'''''

Also from [[Rotwelsch]] ''tof'' and from [[Yiddish]] ''tov'' ("good", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German ''tiuvel'' "Devil").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/15158/ |title=Spit Your Way To Safety: Toi, toi, toi! |publisher=Forward Association, Inc. |date=11 February  2009 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spitting idea===

A separate explanation sees "toi toi toi" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times, a [[Spitting#Spitting as a protection against evil|common practice in many parts of the world]] to ward off evil spirits. Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers.

{{Main|Break a leg}}
An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from [[Italy]], is the phrase ''[[Wikt:in bocca al lupo|In bocca al lupo!]]'' ("In the mouth of the wolf") with the response ''Crepi!'' or ''Crepi il lupo!''  ("May it [the wolf] die!"). Amongst [[actor]]s "[[Break a leg]]" is the usual phrase, while for [[Dance|professional dancers]] the traditional saying is ''[[merde]]'' (from the French "shit"). In Spanish, the phrase is ''mucha mierda'', or "lots of shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Urdang |first1=Laurence |last2=Hunsinger |first2=Walter W. |last3=LaRoche |first3=Nancy |title=Picturesque Expressions: A thematic dictionary |publisher=Gale Research |page=321 |year=1985 |isbn=0-8103-1606-4 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McConnell1977&gt;{{cite book |last1=McConnell |first1=Joan |last2=McConnell |first2=Teena |title=Ballet as body language |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1977 |isbn=0-06-012964-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The QI Elves|title=No Such Thing As The Ugly Panda|url=https://soundbutt.com/nosuchthingasafish/episode-62-no-such-thing-as-the-ugly-panda|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=No Such Thing as a Fish|issue=62|publisher=Quite Interesting Ltd.}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Toy Story''''' is a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer animated]] [[film series]] and [[Disney]] [[media franchise]] that began with the [[Toy Story|1995 film of the same name]], produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The franchise is based on the [[anthropomorphic]] concept that all toys, unknown to humans, are secretly alive, and the films focus on a diverse group of toys that feature a classic cowboy named [[Sheriff Woody]] and a modern spaceman named [[Buzz Lightyear]]. The group unexpectedly embark on adventures that challenge and change them.

The first two films of the franchise were directed by [[John Lasseter]], and the third by [[Lee Unkrich]], who acted as the co-director of the second film (together with Lasseter and [[Ash Brannon]]). [[Josh Cooley]] is directing the upcoming [[Toy Story 4|fourth film]],&lt;ref name="Graser"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/john-lasseter-to-direct-toy-story-4-out-in-2017-1201349848/ | title = John Lasseter to Direct ‘Toy Story 4,’ Out in 2017 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first = Marc | last = Graser | date = November 6, 2014 | access-date = November 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set for release in June 2019.

All three films, produced on a total budget of $320 million, have grossed more than $1.9 billion worldwide. Each film set [[box office]] records, with the third included in the top 15 all time worldwide films. [[Film criticism|Critics]] have given all three films positive reviews.&lt;ref name="toystoryrt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystory2rt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystory3rt" /&gt; Special [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] editions of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' were released on March 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekadelphia.com/2010/03/23/review-toy-story-1-and-2-on-blu-ray/|author=Dan|title=Toy Story 1 and 2 on Blu-Ray: Out Today!

The films were produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

The first and second films got a perfect 100%, and the third a 98% rating, on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

The plot involves Andy, an imaginative young boy, getting a new Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday, causing Sheriff Woody, a vintage cowboy doll, to think that he has been replaced as Andy's favorite toy. In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips, who likes to torture and destroy toys. The film was critically and financially successful, grossing over $361 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="toystoryrt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystoryboxmoj" /&gt; The film was later re-released in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] as part of a double feature, along with ''Toy Story 2'', for a 2-week run,&lt;ref name="Empire3D"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Olly|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21856|title=Toy Story Movies Going 3D|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=January 24, 2008|access-date=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later extended due to its financial success.&lt;ref name=oct12update2&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David|title=Lee Unkrich Announces Kristen Schaal and Blake Clark Cast in Toy Story 3; Toy Story 3D Double Feature To Stay in Theaters|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/lee-unkrich-announces-kristen-schaal-and-blake-clark-cast-in-toy-story-3-toy-story-3d-double-feature-to-stay-in-theaters/|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=SlashFilm|date=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Toy Story 2}}
''Toy Story 2'', the second film in the franchise, was released on November 24, 1999. John Lasseter reprised his role as director. The plot involves Woody getting stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz and several of Andy's toys set off to attempt to free Woody, who meanwhile has discovered his origins as a historic television star. ''Toy Story 2'' was not originally intended for release in theaters, but as a direct-to-video sequel to the original ''Toy Story'', with a 60-minute running time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Karl|title=Toy Story 2 Is Not Your Typical Hollywood Sequel|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=December 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Disney's executives were impressed by the high quality of the in-work imagery for the sequel, and were also pressured by the main characters' voice actors [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], so they decided to convert ''Toy Story 2'' into a theatrical film.&lt;ref name=WrapTimAllenSigned&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=Exclusive: Tim Allen Signed On for 'Toy Story 4'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/exclusive-tim-allen-return-toy-story-4-19245|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=The Wrap|date=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out to be an even greater success than the original ''Toy Story'', grossing over $497 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=toystory2boxmoj /&gt; The film was re-released in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] as part of a double feature, along with ''Toy Story'', on October 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="Empire3D" /&gt;

{{main|Toy Story 3}}
''Toy Story 3'', the third film in the franchise, was released on June 18, 2010, nearly 11 years after ''Toy Story 2'' was. It was the first ''Toy Story'' film not to be directed by John Lasseter (although he remained involved in the film as executive producer), but by [[Lee Unkrich]], who edited the first two films and co-directed the second. The plot focuses on the toys being accidentally dropped off at a daycare center while their owner, Andy, is getting ready to go to college. The film contains over 150 new characters, according to Pixar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/ts3/characters.html|title=Toy Story 3: The Characters|publisher=Pixar|year=2009|access-date=May 11, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425204759/http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/ts3/characters.html|archivedate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains [[List of Pixar films|Pixar]]'s highest-grossing film of all time both domestically and worldwide, surpassing ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.

The special follows the toys on their road trip when a flat tire leads Bonnie and her mother to spend the night in a roadside motel. After one of the toys goes missing, the others begin to search for it, but they too are picked off one by one. The toys discover that they are being targeted by the hotel manager's pet [[iguana]], Mr. Jones, who has been trained to steal the toys of his guests so that they can be sold via the Internet. The manager nearly succeeds in selling Woody and Jessie, but Jessie manages to escape—overcoming her old fear of [[Claustrophobia|being packed away]] in the process—and draw Bonnie's attention to the cabinet where the toys are being kept. As a result, Bonnie recovers her toys, and her mom calls in the police, who then presumably arrests the manager for theft.

Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery similar to the film's animation for personal computers; game developers wanted to learn how to replicate the animation for video games; and robotics researchers were interested in building [[artificial intelligence]] into their machines that compared to the lifelike characters in the film.&lt;ref name="ImpactPossible"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Tom|author2=Galyn Susman |authorlink=Thomas Porter (Pixar)|title=Creating Lifelike Characters in Pixar Movies|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2000/1/7745-on-site-creating-lifelike-characters-in-pixar-movies/abstract|publisher=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=January 1, 2000|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors have also compared the film to an interpretation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' as well as [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="TSQuixote"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burningham|first=Bruce|year=2000|title=Walt Disney's Toy Story as Postmodern Don Quixote|journal=Cervantes|publisher=Cervantes Society of America|volume=20|issue=1|pages=157–174|url=http://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/artics00/burningh.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InfinityHeaven"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucia K.B.|last=Hall|title=Toy Stories for Humanists?|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27546351_ITM|publisher=The Humanist|date=March 1, 2000|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trick roping''' is an entertainment or competitive art involving the spinning of a [[lasso]] also known as a lariat or a "rope."  It is particularly associated with [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] or western arts in the United States.

The lasso is a well-known tool of American [[cowboy]]s, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.

There is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: "flat loop", "vertical loop" and "butterfly". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes. Among the vertical loop tricks is the "Texas Skip", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Well-known trick ropers include:

*[[Texas Jack Omohundro]], the first performer to introduce roping acts to the American stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=Herschel C.|title=Buckskin and Satin: The Life of Texas Jack and His Wife|date=1954||page=73|publisher=Stackpole|location=Harrisburg|url=https://archive.org/details/buckskinandstain007287mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Montie Montana]], who had a 60-year career as a trick roper, also appeared in several [[John Wayne]] movies.

*Actor and humorist [[Will Rogers]], known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film "The Ropin' Fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Ropin' Fool|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124857/|date = 1922-10-29|accessdate = 2016-02-23|first = Clarence G.|last = Badger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Vince Bruce, born April 4, 1955, died September 24, 2011: Internationally acclaimed as one of the best western acts in the world, Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical ''The Will Rogers Follies — A Life in Revue''. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York’s Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record — 4,011 — for “Texas Skips”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vince Bruce - Obituaries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8818953/Vince-Bruce.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|agency=The Telegraph|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Florence LaDue|Flores LaDue]] (1883-1951): the only cowgirl to claim three world championships for trick and fancy roping, Flores remained undefeated in the event. Flores and her husband, Guy Weadick, also a Trick Roper, organized and produced the first Calgary Stampede. Flores Ladue is reputed to have been the first trick roper to perform the trick known as the Texas Skip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flores Ladue|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/flores-ladue/|website=National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1053">'''Voice casting''' is a vital pre-production process for selecting the [[voice talent]] for [[radio]] and [[television]] [[commercials]], [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[corporate]] [[narrations]], [[audiobook]]s and [[online tutorials]]. It involves a series of [[auditions]] in front of a [[Film producer|producer]]/[[Film director|director]].

==Online voice casting==
There has been a shift to online voice over casting in recent years. With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdrewvo.com/html/home_voiceover_studio.html|title=Home Voiceover Studios-Equipping Yours-Peter Drew Voiceovers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents. Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.
