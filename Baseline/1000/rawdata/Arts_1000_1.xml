'''''"Master Harold"...and the boys''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Athol Fugard]].  Set in 1950, it was first produced at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in March 1982 and made its premiere on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on 4 May at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]],&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|authorlink1=Frank Rich|title=STAGE: 'MASTER HAROLD,' FUGARD'S DRAMA ON ORIGIN OF HATE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9504E6DC1738F936A35756C0A964948260|accessdate=13 September 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 5, 1982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in [[South Africa]] during [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era, and depicts how institutionalized [[racism]], bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was also similar to Hally's, as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called "Master Harold", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to.

The play was initially [[censorship|banned]] from production in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Master Harold...and the Boys | url=http://www.colonytheatre.org/news/PRMasterHarold.html | publisher=The Colony Theatre Company | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Fugard's plays to premiere outside of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt;

==Plot==
The play recounts the long, rainy afternoon that Hally ("Master Harold") spends with Sam and Willie, two middle-aged African servants of his parent's household, in a tea shop owned by Hally's mother.  Sam and Willie have cared for seventeen year old Hally his whole life.

At the start of the play Sam and Willie are practicing [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is quickly revealed as being the more worldly of the two.  When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps.

Hally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition.  Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood, and has always treated Hally as his nephew/ward.  Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood.  And hopefully thereby, takes up those values and viewpoints of an adult; and a man, that Sam, has over the years lain down; and, that all men try to leave as their legacy of shepherding an adolescent boy into manhood.  Willie, for his part, has always played the "loyal black"; who has always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) "Master Harold"; As if, as a man of forty-five, he was addressing a superior; even when Hally was six.

The conversation between the three moves from Hally's school-work, to an intellectual discussion on "A Man of Magnitude", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a Boarding House. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word [[English studies|English]] composition.  The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the [[ballroom dancing]] floor ("a world without collisions") is used as a transcendent [[metaphor]] for life.

Almost immediately despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in [[World War II]], to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged, and that the call must've been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father, is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home.

Hally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger, and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him "Master Harold" and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry and both he and Willie are just short of attacking Hally, but they both understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.

There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up "It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember," then asks Willie to lock up the tea shop, and walks out into the rain, as Sam mentions that the bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said "Whites Only" but Hally was too excited to notice it, and that he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. The play ends while Sam and Willie console each other by ballroom dancing together.

==Critical reception==
John Simon, writing for [[New York Magazine]], was measured in his review:{{quote |text=Fugard has now perfected his way of writing plays about the tragedy of apartheid; he avoids the spectacular horrors and concentrates instead on the subtle corrosion and corruption, on the crumbling of the spirit for which the cure would be heroic action that may not be forthcoming, which the blacks try to assuage with the salve of dreams, the whites with the cautery of oppression.|author=[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], "'Two Harolds and no Medea." (May 17, 1982)&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=John|title=Two Harolds and no Medea|journal=New York Magazine|date=17 May 1982|volume=15|issue=20|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=m-cCAAAAMBAJ|publisher=New York Media, LLC|language=English|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: {{quote |text=There may be two or three living playwrights in the world who can write as well as Athol Fugard, but I'm not sure that any of them has written a recent play that can match '' 'Master Harold' ... and the Boys.'' Mr. Fugard's drama - lyrical in design, shattering in impact - is likely to be an enduring part of the theater long after most of this Broadway season has turned to dust.|author=Frank Rich, "'Master Harold,' Fugard's drama on the origin of hate."

'''''AIDS photo diary, 1986–1990''''' is an art work that comprises a photo diary that records the decline in health and eventual death of David Tosh, from [[AIDS]] from 1986 to 1990 in [[Sydney]], Australia. The diary – with accompanying photographs taken by John Jenner – was created by Jenner to remember his friend and honour the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. Some of the images were featured in an article in ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s ''Good Weekend'' magazine, 13 October 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS photo diary, 1986–1990 / photographed and compiled by John Jenner|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=844424|work=SLNSW catalogue|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The work includes photographs by John Jenner from 1986 to 1990, together with a biography in the form of a play written by Jenner.  The diary also includes poems by Willy Barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Jenner – papers, 1985 – 1993|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=9514|work=SLNSW catalogue|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
This diary was one of a number of artistic responses to [[HIV/AIDS in Australia]] at a time when medications that could prolong and enhance the quality of life of those living with HIV had not been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/articles/0310sendziuk.html |title=Denying the Grim Reaper: Australian Responses to AIDS |author=Sendziuk, Paul |work=Eureka Street |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Tosh died on 3 May 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Sydney Morning Herald 'Good Weekend' magazine|date=13 December 1990|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990 Australia experienced 2381 cases of AIDS as reported by the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Davies, Peter | author2=Aggleton, Peter | author3=Hart, Graham | title=AIDS : rights, risk, and reason | publication-date=1992 | publisher=Falmer Press | isbn=978-0-7507-0039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  97% of these cases were male and the survival rate was only 40%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Art fabrication''' is a process or service relating to the production of large or technically difficult artworks.

When a lone artist or designer is incapable or chooses not to realize the creation of his or her own design or conception, he or she may enlist the assistance of an art fabrication studio.  Typically, an art fabrication studio has access to the resources, specialized machinery, and labor necessary to execute particularly complex projects.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Notable art fabricators==

Lippincott, Inc., founded in 1966 by Donald Lippincott and Roxanne Everett, was the first company to devote itself exclusively to art fabrication using industrial techniques. The company encouraged a collaborative relationship between artists and the fabrication crew, allowing the creation of work using media that artists had not previously used. Lippincott, Inc. fabricated work for almost 100 artists, including [[Barnett Newman]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Indiana]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An '''artist collective''' is an initiative that is the result of a group of [[artist]]s working together, usually under their own [[management]], towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the [[artist]], this can range from purchasing bulk [[List of artistic media|materials]], sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared [[ideologies]], [[aesthetic]] and [[politics|political]] views or even living and working together as an [[extended family]]. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an [[Voluntary association|association]] or a [[company]].

==Overview==
Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on [[Milos]] in Greece and [[Carrara]] in Italy. Collectives featured during both the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the [[French Revolution]] when the [[Louvre]] in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.

More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in [[Art gallery|gallery]] shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales.  Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | date = March 1893
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g2gCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA580
 | accessdate = 11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| journal=Educational Theatre Journal
| volume=15 | issue=2 
| date=May 1963
| pages=136–142
| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">The '''Arundel Society''' was founded at [[London]] in 1849 and named after the [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]], the famous collector of the [[Arundel marbles|Arundel Marbles]] and one of the first great [[English people|English]] patrons and lovers of the arts. The society was originally the idea of the lawyer [[Charles Henry Bellenden Ker|Bellenden Ker]] and was founded at a meeting in the house of the famous painter [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]], attended by Eastlake, Ker, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, and Edmund Oldfield. The society's purpose was to promote knowledge of the art works of the old Italian, Flemish, and other European masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Nineteenth Century|title=The Arundel Society|author=[[William Henry Gregory|Gregory.

==Arundel Club==
The '''Arundel Club''' was a society founded in London in 1904 for the purpose of continuing more effectively the work of the Arundel Society, which had encouraged the study of art by reproducing the best works of the old masters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12708">The '''Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención''' (AACI) is an Argentinian art movement that focuses on [[Concrete art|Concrete Art]]. Following [[World War II|WWII]], numerous pieces Latin American art as well as several Latin American artists used themes regarding [[Socialism]] and Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvaa.com.ar/04ingles/02dossiers_en/concretos_en/04_historia_4_en.php|title=Concrete Art in Argentina. History 4|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists from the AACI proposed, for the first time in the history of Argentina, the necessity for an art that was different from symbolic, representational, and expressionistic art. They believed that their artwork, or "inventions" could harbor social change in their current Argentinian political climate. The founders of the AACI showed similar themes throughout their artworks, such as a desire to appear with universality, objectivity, and lack any sort of representativeness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MARGINAL DISRUPTIONS: CONCRETE AND MADÍ ART IN ARGENTINA, 1940-1955|last=Jorgelina Pozzi-Harris|first=Ana|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|year=2007|isbn=|location=Austin, Texas|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The formation of the Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención officially happened in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/maldonado-tomas/|title=Art &amp; Art  MALDONADO Tomás|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of this organization were primarily [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]], [[Lidy Prati]], [[Alfredo Hlito]], [[Raúl Lozza]], [[Enio Iommi|Enio Lommi]], [[Manuel Espinosa|Manuel Espinoza]], and [[Juan Melé]]. The creation of the AACI happened because of a difference in artistic beliefs. Maldonado and Prati were married during this time period, despite being in the same artistic group and movement. In 1944, Maldonado, [[Rhod Rothfuss]], [[Gyula Kosice]], Lidy Prati, and [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] produced the first and only issue of the illustrated magazine ''Arturo''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Concrete-Invention|title=Concrete Invention {{!}} art group|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of ''Arturo'' was the beginning of a distinct revolutionary period in Argentinian art. The magazine expressed the founders' shared opposition of representational and symbolic art. However, from the magazine, two artistic groups emerged. [[Grupo Madí|Grupo Madi]], led by [[Arden Quin]], Kosice, and Rothfuss. And Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención led by Maldonado and Prati.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influences ==
The first influence that happened upon the world of Latin American art regarding [[Concrete art|Concrete Art]] came from the works of [[Joaquín Torres-García|Joaquín Torres-Garcia]]. In 1936, Torres-Garcia had already referred to invention, speaking about those movements that put new art styles to use, such as Impressionism or Cubism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cvaa.com.ar/04ingles/02dossiers_en/concretos_en/04_historia_3_en.php|title=Concrete Art in Argentina. History 3|website=cvaa.com.ar|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Torres-Garcia, came the entirety of the Concrete art movement. Maldonado had a noticeable impact on the AACI because of his restraints he put on the artists and artworks. His political views seemed to influence his views on artwork. Maldonado was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who had certain utopian ambitions for the art created by the AACI in a new revolutionary societal movement in Latin America. The political views demonstrated by AACI members were often communistic and somewhat socialistic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/asociacion-arte-concreto-invencion-concrete-invention-art-association|title=Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (Concrete-Invention Art Association) – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While simultaneously following the purist aesthetics of artists such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]]. The art group rapidly began making waves among the art world and by 1946, Prati and Maldonado had attracted the interest of one of the original practicing concrete artists in Switzerland, [[Max Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Argentine Abstract Art|last=Battiti|first=Florencia|publisher=Fundacion Proa|year=2002|isbn=|location=Buenos Aires|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arturo Magazine ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The aforementioned magazine was the first work by the members of the AACI before they were officially together as a group. The concepts “invention” and “trimmed frame” are used to portray the movement of Concrete Art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These terms originated with the issuing of the Arturo magazine, and are perhaps the most original contributions to the Concrete Art movement. Arden Quin discussed about invention in ''Arturo’s'' first article. He rose against Expressionism, Surrealism, and any form of Realism in his works.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a common theme among the group and among concrete artists as a whole. Regarding the appearance of Arturo, Ana J. Pozzi-Harris writes, "In the Argentina of the early 1940s, no artist or movement held truly comparable ideas to those exposed in Arturo or in the early exhibitions of the Concrete and Madí artists. Exhibition reviews show that the most successful Argentine artists from this period worked in styles which may be categorized as classical and academic; picturesque and romantic; and expressionist."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a description of the magazine, the cover was an engraving by Tomás Maldonado and in the inner pages were seen several pieces by this artist and by Lidy Prati as well. There also were essays and poems by Edgard Bailey, Gyula Kosice, Torres-García, [[Vicente Huidobro]] and [[Murilo Mendes]], and projects reproduced by [[Maria Helena Vieira da Silva|Vieira Da Silva]], Torres-García, [[Augusto Torres]], Kandinsky, Mondrian and Rothfuss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An important influence that can be seen in the magazine is from the Dutch artist Theo Van Doesburg. He formulated in “''Basis of the Concrete painting''”, in Paris, April 1930.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Van Doesburg described concrete art by stating,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"1) Art is universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2) The work of art must be conceived and entirely shaped by the spirit before its execution. It must not receive anything from the given shapes of nature, neither from sensuality, nor from sentimentality. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3) The picture must be entirely built with purely plastic elements, that is to say, planes and colors. A pictorial element has no other significance but that of “itself”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4) The construction of the picture, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5) The technique must be mechanical, that is to say, exact, anti-impressionist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;6) Endeavor for absolute clearness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These guidelines for Concrete Art truly united all of the contributor's when creating their artworks for Arturo. Their similar beliefs led to a criticism of all art that could be interpreted, the AACI wanted to have their works be viewed with simplicity and with no forms of interpretation.

== Madí and the AACI ==
From the publication of ''Arturo'', two similar Argentinian artistic groups emerged. These aforementioned groups both believed in the artistic style of Concrete art, however, their perspectives of this type of artwork differed. The Madí’s members worked in various ways; they often distributed small posters and pamphlets in the streets of Buenos Aires. They also published the magazine ''Arte Madí Universal'' from 1947 to 1954 and organized art showings that mixed types visual art, poetry, music, and performance to create an encapsulating Concrete Art experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their art emphasized materials and the reality of these materials, often changing the conventional frame for strangely shaped canvases and frames to encapsulate their works. In 1946, both groups publicly announced their separations and different agendas through their manifestos. For the AACI, Maldonado read the "Manifiesto Invencionista" (Inventionist Manifesto) in March 1946 at their first exhibition in the Salón Peuser. The Madí read their Manifiesto Madí (Madí Manifesto) altogether at the Instituto Francés de Estudios Superiores in August 1946.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most of the art created by both groups was during the rule of the infamous Argentinian president [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]]. Perón was a former Colonel in the Argentine army whom assumed the power of [[President of Argentina]] in February 1946. Perón's extremely authoritarian rule many called "Fascist" used means of mass propaganda, mass appeal, and outright oppressive measures to remain in control of Argentina until 1955. Scholars suggest the political climate of the Peronian era had a direct influence on both the AACI and the Madí.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-02|title=Juan Perón|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Per%C3%B3n&amp;oldid=813135657|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties attempted to use their Communist influence to combat the Perón agenda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Selected Artworks ==
'''''Serial Composition'':''' A piece made by [[Lidy Prati]], done in 1948, and held in the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires. The Dutch artist [[Piet Mondrian]] is historically found to be a crucial influence on the art of Prati and connections are often made about this piece and his works. This artwork shows a theme of systematic geometric abstraction which can be interpreted through the various red, white, and black rectangles or squares spaced equally far apart from one another in a grid format. This style of equidistant geometric shapes was often seen from various artists in the AACI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/lidy-prati-made-1970s-art-1948-472988|title=Lidy Prati Made 1970s Art ... in 1948 {{!}} artnet News|date=2016-04-14|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coplanar Nº13'':''' An artwork made by [[Juan Melé]] in 1946 that consists of three different shapes made of wood, colored with oil paint and connected by a metal rod behind each of the shapes. The style used makes an appearance to the viewer that the geometric objects float in front of the wall behind them. Melé often experimented with various frames, backgrounds, and colors. His distinct artistic format is easily recognizable in this piece. ''Coplanar Nº13'' simultaneously shows the core values of the AACI in its universality and lacking of any symbolism or representational effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandartcollection.com/en/artists/mele-juan/|title=Art &amp; Art  MELÉ Juan|website=www.artandartcollection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Composition'':''' This oil on canvas painting by [[Tomás Maldonado|Tómas Maldonado]] depicts multiple colored and black lines of different width meeting near the center of the piece to form a rectangular shape. This piece was created in 1950 and is currently being held in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Argentina. Regarding the painting, author María Amalia Garcia describes, "''Composición'' is based on neo-plastic postulates that seek to exalt the white surface by way of tension generated between different elements inscribed on that support."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellasartes.gob.ar/en/the-collection-highlights/7165|title=Composition (Composición) - Maldonado, Tomás|last=NSNC|first=grupo|website=www.bellasartes.gob.ar|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Development of a Triangle'':''' Another oil on canvas painting by Maldonado that exhibits different sized triangles along with several intersecting black lines coming down the canvas. It is currently being held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The piece demonstrates geometric abstraction and follows the strict regiments of any artwork that is considered to be related to the AACI.

A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".&lt;ref name=institution&gt;Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;Jones, Patti (2011). [http://www.parents.com/fun/entertainment/books/the-brainy-benefits-of-bedtime-stories/ "The Brainy Benefits of Bedtime Stories"]. ''Parents Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[unselfishness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt; Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

The '''Bishop Arts District''' is a small shopping and entertainment district in north [[Oak Cliff]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]), near the intersection of Bishop Street and Davis Street.  Bishop Arts is immediately southwest of [[Downtown Dallas]].

== About ==
The area was originally developed as warehouses and shops in the 1920s.  In the 1930s, a trolley stop along Davis became Dallas' busiest trolley stop.  The district began a decline in the mid-60's through the beginning of the 80's. The reasons for the decline included the rise of the shopping mall, the loss of sizable tenants such as Astor theater and Goodier Cosmetics, neighborhood demographic changes and finally the fact that buses began to replace streetcars making trolley stops like Bishop and Seventh useless.

In the fall of 1984, Jim Lake saw a bargain in the now run down storefronts and began buying up property. He said, "Hopefully we'll make money on this in the future, but in the first three to five years I'm gonna feed it." Lake said of his decision to buy the property, "I just thought it needed saving." As a sign of his commitment, Lake provided, rent-free for a year, space for a police storefront. This was an important element in the area's security and sense of community. Continuing through the 1990s and 2000s, renovations have taken place to transform the two city blocks into a walkable, urban environment, although the surrounding area has yet to undergo revitalization. Murals, brick pavers, and other street elements have polished the rough look of the warehouses and have made the area a popular leisure and dining destination.&lt;ref name="bishopartsdistrict.com"&gt;[http://www.bishopartsdistrict.com Bishop Arts District] - Main page.  Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area culture has continued to mature with the expanding Oak Cliff Film Festival, which has garnered media attention from Texas Monthly and New York Times.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/us/dallas-has-its-own-indie-film-scene-and-now-a-festival.html] - News Article. Retrieved 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the district is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[North Bishop Avenue Commercial Historic District]].

Many times the reference, in Jewish sources, is to that which enlightens spiritually.

==Mystical interpretations in Judaism==
It has also been described as an "orgasm in the process of the divine".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qloL-PJdtzYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22buzina%22+aramaic&amp;ots=OkbdpQxL9P&amp;sig=P-N5ETljMb2Mbx73RfQkYFePaBE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22buzina%22%20&amp;f=false |title=Reading the Zohar: the sacred text of the Kabbalah |author=Pinchas Giller |publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2001|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchas Giller, in ''Reading the Zohar: the sacred text of the Kabbalah'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), devotes a section to the phrase, calling it "the boldest image of the ''Hormanuta'' literature".&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;  John Tindall Harris and William Robert Brown wrote in ''The writings of the Apostle John: with notes, critical and expository'' (1889) that "our lord used words that could not fail to be understood by the people, for among the Jews any one distinguished for light and erudition was termed in Aramaic ... ''bostina, a lamp or torch'' (Ber. Rab. 95.4).  Chrystosom observes, He called John a torch or lamp, signifying that he had not light of himself but by the grace of the Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vQIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=%22Botsina%22+aramaic&amp;ots=FiB1KffJ59&amp;sig=ka1FH7ZrUzXPcK4c2nM3HTcT_94#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Botsina%22%20&amp;f=false |title=The writings of the Apostle John: with notes, critical and expository |author=John Tindall Harris, William Robert Brown |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |date=1889 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yehuda Liebes]], in ''Studies in Jewish myth and Jewish messianism'' (SUNY Press, 1993), wrote that "ambiguities of meaning are typical in the [[Zohar]], and the word ''bostina'' (spark) illustrates this well".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==As a descriptive term for Torah sages==
Many{{Who|date=June 2009}} people have been referred to as Botsina Kadisha ("[The] Holy Lantern") but foremost Rabbi [[Shimon Bar Yochai]], the author of the Zohar (the prime of Jewish esoteric works) is referred to as Botsina Kadisha.

The [[Arizal]], Rabbi [[Itzhak Luria]], the most famous Kabbalist of modern times is referred to as Botsina Kadisha in the books of his disciple Rabbi Chaim Vital. He lived about 500 years ago in Tzfat, Israel.

The alter Rebbe of the Chabad movement is referred to as Botsina Kadisha as is seen in the opening of his book Likutei Torah. He lived a few hundred years ago and he is the author of the famous Chabad book called The Tanya or Sefer Beinonim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10456">[[File:Armlet Resurrection Louvre OA8261.jpg|thumb|310px|High-quality [[Mosan art|Mosan]] 12th century armlet, somewhat damaged, so showing the cast recesses for the enamel]]

'''''Champlevé''''' is an [[enamelling]] technique in the [[decorative arts]], or an object made by that process, in which troughs or cells are carved, etched, die struck, or [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] into the surface of a metal object, and filled with [[vitreous enamel]]. The piece is then fired until the enamel fuses, and when cooled the surface of the object is polished. The uncarved portions of the original surface remain visible as a frame for the enamel designs; typically they are [[gilded]] in medieval work.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332&lt;/ref&gt;  The name comes from the French for "raised field", "field" meaning background, though the technique in practice lowers the area to be enamelled rather than raising the rest of the surface. 

The technique has been used since ancient times, though it is no longer among the most commonly used enamelling techniques. Champlevé is suited to the covering of relatively large areas, and to figurative images, although it was first prominently used in [[Celtic art]] for geometric designs.  In [[Romanesque art]] its potential was fully used, decorating caskets, plaques and vessels, in [[Limoges enamel]] and that from other centres. 
  
Champlevé is distinguished from the technique of [[cloisonné]] enamel in which the troughs are created by soldering flat metal strips to the surface of the object. The difference between the techniques is analogous to the [[woodworking]] techniques of [[intarsia]] and [[marquetry]].  It differs from the ''[[basse-taille]]'' technique, which succeeded it in the highest quality Gothic work, in that the bottoms of the recesses for the enamel are rough, and so only opaque enamel colours are used. In ''basse-taille'' the recesses are modelled, and translucent enamels are used, for more subtle effects, as in the 14th century Parisian [[Royal Gold Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early champlevé==
[[File:Ornamental Bronze Plaque, Celtic Horse-gear, Santon, Norfolk.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic red enamel on horse-harness, Britain, c. AD 50]] 
 
Enamel was first used on small pieces of jewellery, and has often disintegrated in ancient pieces that have been buried.  Consistent and frequent use of champlevé technique is first seen in the [[La Tène style]] of early [[Celtic art]] in Europe, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC, where the predominant colour was a red, possibly intended as an imitation of red [[coral]] (as used on the [[Witham Shield]]), and the base was usually [[bronze]].  The "Insular Celts" of the British Isles made especially common use of the technique, seen as highlights on the relief decoration of the [[Battersea Shield]] and other pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 8-10, Osbourne, 332&lt;/ref&gt; However this was technically not true enamel in the usual sense of the word, as the glass was only heated until it became a soft paste before being pushed into place. This is sometimes informally known as "sealing-wax" enamelling, and may be described as "glass inlay" or similar terms.  True enamelling technique, where glass paste is put into place and fired until it liquifies, was learnt from the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 173&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest literary description of enamel is from the Greek [[sophist]] [[Philostratus III]], who wrote in his ''Icones'' (Bk I, 28), describing polychrome horse-harness: "It is said that the barbarians in the Ocean pour these colours on heated bronze and that they adhere, become as hard as stone and preserve the designs that are made on them".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Staffordshire Moorlands Pan (1284837406).jpg|thumb|The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]], 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel in four colours.]]

Celtic curvilinear styles were highly effective in enamel, and were used throughout the Roman period when they largely disappear in other media. The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] is a 2nd-century ''trulla'' with large enamel roundels in four colours of enamel, commissioned by or for Draco, a soldier, possibly a Greek, as a souvenir of his service on [[Hadrian's Wall]].  It is one of a group of similar enamelled vessels found in Britain and northern Gaul.  Smaller items from similar contexts include [[brooch]]es and other jewellery, and mounts for horse harness as described by Philostratus.  Around the end of the Roman Empire new forms arose: the terminals of the increasingly fancy [[penannular brooches]] of the British Isles become decorated with champlevé, as do other fasteners and fittings, and the mounts of [[hanging bowl]]s.  These last have long puzzled art historians, as not only is their purpose unclear, but they are mostly found in [[Anglo-Saxon]] and Viking contexts, including three at [[Sutton Hoo]], but their decoration uses predominantly Celtic motifs. One of the Sutton Hoo bowls had been repaired, but in a different, Germanic, style.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford, 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, production of the different types of hanging bowls covers the period 400–1100.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce-Mitford, 34, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  While the leading expert, [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]], sees the bowls as the products of "Celtic" workshops, perhaps often in Ireland, in the same period the use of large areas of champlevé in the most ornate [[Celtic brooches]] reduces, though gem-like enamel highlights, some in ''[[millefiori]]'', are still found.  In [[Anglo-Saxon art]], as in that of most of Europe and the Byzantine world, this was the period when cloisonné technique dominated enamelling.

==Romanesque==
[[File:Limoges enamel ciborium pseudo Kufic circa 1200.jpg|thumb|left|Elaborate Limoges [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], c. 1200]] 
Champlevé is especially associated with [[Romanesque art]], and many of the finest survivals of the style feature the technique. There was a great increase in use of the technique in several areas in the late 11th century, just as the Romanesque style matured.  The immediate source of the style remains obscure; various exotic origins have been suggested, but the great expansion in the use of [[stained glass]] at the same period is probably connected.  Copper or bronze bases were normally used, which were soft and easy to work, as well as relatively cheap, but as they discoloured in heat opaque enamels needed to be used.  Blue was now the dominant colour, as in stained glass; the best blues in painting (whether on wall, panel or manuscript) were very expensive whereas in glass rich blues are easily obtainable.   

[[Mosan art|Mosan]] and [[Limoges enamels]] are the most famous, and the figures carved in the copper plate display a superb sense of line.  The [[Stavelot Triptych]] in New York is an example of the finest Mosan work, and the [[Becket Casket]] in London a fine early piece from Limoges.  The names of several Mosan [[goldsmith]]-enamellers are known.  Relief and fully modelled figures were also enamelled, and some metal bases formed by hammering into moulds.  The Limoges production increased steadily in quantity, and by the Gothic period had declined in quality, but provided a fairly cheap product, especially of [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]] caskets,   produced on a semi-industrial scale and exported all over Europe.  Spanish enamels, not easily distinguished from Limoges work, were also produced on a large scale.  Mosan work was sometimes on gold or [[silver-gilt]], but in Limoges and Spain [[gilding|gilt-copper]] is usual, and much Mosan work uses this too, as in the example illustrated.  This example also shows the mixing of different colours and shades within the same cell, here used throughout the design in a complex manner, whereas in the Limoges examples below much less, and much simpler, use is made of this difficult technique.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
A similar technique was known as "shippou-zogan" in [[Japan]], where it was considered a form of [[damascening]].

'''Collage''' (from the {{lang-fr| coller}}, "to glue";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollagedenise.com%2Fpage2.html&amp;date=2012-04-12 |url=http://collagedenise.com/page2.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |title=Origin of the term "collage" |first=Denise |last=Enslen}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|kɔ.laʒ}}) is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the [[visual arts]], where the artwork is made from an [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] of different forms, thus creating a new whole.

A collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.

The term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early precedents===
Techniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview&lt;/ref&gt; Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].

===Collage and modernism===
[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah Höch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&amp;nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]
Despite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.

For example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage "was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage "Introduction to collage"]. Tate Gallery website&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches "collided with the surface plane of the painting."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works "gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other," according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: "References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art." This juxtaposition of signifiers, "at once serious and tongue-in-cheek," was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: "Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

===Collage in painting===
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (Tête), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (Tête)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]
Collage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):

"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

In 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte à la chaise cannée)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte à la chaise cannée] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Musée National Picasso Paris&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.

[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#Étrécissements|etrécissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mariën]] from a method first explored by Mariën. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.

The [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau Réalisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau Réalisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.
Wesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,&lt;ref&gt;(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.

Another technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.

===Collage with wood===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; part of a series of experimental collages.]] --&gt;
[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918–1986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.

In a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt; Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.

It was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, "As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting..."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://12.172.4.131/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A4278&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Louise Nevelson]'' - [[The Museum of Modern Art]], MoMA Highlights, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.

Much wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.

Frequently, what is called "wood collage art" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable "[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)

===Decoupage===
[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|découpée]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]
{{Main|Decoupage}}
Decoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.

In the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].

There are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].

The craft became known as découpage in [[France]] (from the verb ''découper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].

The most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].

===Photomontage===
{{Main|Photomontage}}
Collage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]

''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.&lt;ref name=tomorrow&gt;[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm "This is tomorrow"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to "image 027TT-1956.jpg"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm "Just what is it"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian "combination printing", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]’s (1912–1988) series of black and white "photomontage projections" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8½ × 11&amp;nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.

The 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create "paste-ups" digitally.

Creating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to "undo" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.

===Digital collage===
Digital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].

===Three-dimensional collage===
A 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.

===Mosaic===
It is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design.Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.

===eCollage===
The term "eCollage" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.

==In other contexts==

===In architecture===
Though [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects used techniques that are akin to collage, collage as a theoretical concept only became widely discussed after the publication of ''Collage City'' (1978) by [[Colin Rowe]] and Fred Koetter.

Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the pictorial sense, much less seeking the types of disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.

===In music===
[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955–1957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]
{{Main|Sound collage}}
The concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.

In the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that "[[sound collage|musical collages]]" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name="timemagazine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, "mash-up" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called "literature of sound." In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).&lt;ref name="soundonsound"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In illustration===
Collage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].

===In artist's books===

Collage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.&lt;ref&gt;https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.

The [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.

===In fashion design===
Collage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.

===In film===
{{main|Collage film}}
Collage film is traditionally defined as, “A film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.” Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director’s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.

====In post-production====
The use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Amélie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en scène]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel’s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.

==Legal issues==
When collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.

Due to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.

The copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the "first sale" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.&lt;ref&gt;''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir. Oct. 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">With respect to [[cultural heritage]], '''conservation science''' is the interdisciplinary study of conservation of art, architecture, technical art history and other cultural works through the use of scientific inquiry.  General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works; the materials and techniques from which cultural, artist and historic objects are made.

[[Conservation scientist (museums)|Conservation scientists]] use [[scientific methods]] and [[Scientific law|principles]] to support work in the fields of [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]], and care of cultural objects in museums and other collections.  Cultural conservation science work includes identifying the materials that make up a structure or piece of art including their chemical makeup, identifying and cataloging changes that cause deterioration and developing methods to mitigate deterioration of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Italy]], conservation science is considered part of the broader field called '[[Heritage Science]]' which also encompasses scientific aspects less directly related to cultural heritage [[Art conservation|conservation]], as well its management and interpretation.

There are four broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage:  1) understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, 2) thorough examination and analysis, 3) study of the causes of deterioration, and 4) improving materials and techniques.  Conservation science includes aspects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] as well as [[engineering]].&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Phillip|title=The Nature of Conservation: A Race Against Time|year=1986|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Marina del Rey, CA|isbn=0-941103-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethiopian Painting 2005 SeanMcClean.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A painting of performing debteras.]]
Debteras are usually chosen from families of other debteras, and are trained from childhood&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufman Shelemay|first1=Kay|authorlink1=Kay Kaufman Shelemay|last2=Jeffery|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter Jeffery|title=Ethiopian Christian liturgical chant: an anthology: Part 2: Performance Practice; The Liturgical Portions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFkFYKGv4XUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1993|publisher=A-R Editions, Inc.|isbn=978-0-89579-294-5|pages=3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[scribe]]s&lt;ref name="Glazier124" /&gt; (learning [[Ge'ez]]&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt;) and as [[cantor (Christianity)|cantors]].

Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans,&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt; and a loose striped over-garment called a ''shamma''.  Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and [[sistrum|sistra]] outside the church or the [[synagogue]] during religious services.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p52-53" /&gt;

=== Among the Beta Israel ===
Among the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a [[kahen]]. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of ''debtra''), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a ''debtera''.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute of Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109-135 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among Christians ===
''Kahens'' and ''debteras'' are two separate professions,&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay|title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-744-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible to pursue both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crummey|first=Donald|title=Land and Society in the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: From the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0w6h0qHGMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02482-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milkias|first=Paulos|title=Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu9mnXhvSswC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-258-6|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lenten services, ''debteras'' tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm.  The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of ''debteras'', citing the story in [[2 Kings]] of [[David]] dancing at the temple and {{Bibleverse||Psalm|47:1|KJV}} ("[[Psalm 47|O clap your hands]]") for Biblical examples.  These performances also feature symbols connected to the [[Passion of Jesus]]: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the [[flagellation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47" /&gt;

== Religio-Magical Healing ==
Debteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers.&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"&gt;Janetius, S.T. Abyssinia in the New Millennium (Revised Edition), 2016. {{ISBN|9783659710629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=pammUsXz-J&amp;dq=famous%20dabtaras&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=famous%20dabtaras&amp;f=false "Healer," Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, by Siegbert Uhlig, publ. by Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also reputed to study [[black magic]] invoking [[demon]]s alongside their more benevolent official learning.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

Some Debteras manufacture [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[amulet]]s meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;  These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary [[Buda (folk religion)|budas]], [[zār]] spirits, and the [[evil eye]].  They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, [[prayer]]s, and exorcisms.  These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of [[holy water]] (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a ''Magic Star Book''.&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;  Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/?q=ethiopian-magic-scroll Description of Ethiopian Magic Scroll] at [[Portland State University]]'s [http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/ Medieval Portland site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some practice (or rather circumvent) [[astrology]], by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names.  This may be considered "cheating" by the locals, however.  Some Debteras have also been noted to use [[Datura stramonium]] to cause hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J00xEkY-vTEC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=debtera&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=debtera&amp;f=false A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis By G-m G-m Lulat, ABC-CLIO, 30 Aug 2005, p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Debteras duties and cures are [[supernatural]].  Debteras place [[scarecrow]]s in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent [[lice]] outbreaks.&lt;ref name="Finneran" /&gt;  Before the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Abyssinia-New-Millennium-Dr-Janetius/dp/1522757716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"/&gt;

'''Directoire style''', {{IPA-fr|di.ʁɛk.twaʁ}}, describes a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design, concurrent with the post-Revolution [[French Directory]] (November 2, 1795 through November 10, 1799). The style uses [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] and [[Empire style|Empire]].

The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers [[Charles Percier]] (1764–1838) and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pier François Léonard Fontaine]] (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate [[Empire style]], which was introduced after [[Napoleon]] established the [[First French Empire]].

The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of [[Roman Republic|republican Rome]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David.... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Electronic Art Café''' (EAC) is a touring art project, which consists of events and exhibitions by artists of international avant-garde. The seat was in the Exhibition Palace in [[Rome]].

Located in [[New York City]] in 1994 from an idea of [[Umberto Scrocca]], was hosted in the Great Hall of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art at the symposium "New York City - Sarajevo", was attended by [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Susan Sontag]] and [[Lisa Gaye]].
Currently the seat is in [[Rome]] in [[Piazza Farnese]] at the Wine Bar Camponeschi and is curated by [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], which invites artists on stage to perform with their work, a performance or a video, thus creating the brand of artist EAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicartcafe.com/exhibition.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicartcafe.com/brochure/10anni/us.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">'''Everyday Aesthetics''' is a recent subfield of philosophical [[aesthetics]] focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of [[sensibility]] is saliently at stake. [[Alexander Baumgarten]] established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as ''scientia cognitionis sensitivae'', the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work ''Aesthetica'' (1750).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/aestheticascrip00baumgoog&lt;/ref&gt; This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of [[fine arts]], [[beauty]] and [[taste]] only marginally referring to the aesthetics in [[design]], [[crafts]], urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the [[aesthetics of nature]], everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.

== Grounding aesthetics in experience ==

Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to [[John Dewey]]’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John ''Art as Experience'' (New York: Perigee,1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Dewey’s pragmatism, [[Richard Shusterman]] validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as ''soma-aesthetics'' also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard ''Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics'' ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992.

== Social dimension of everyday aesthetics ==

The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by [[Katya Mandoki]] who in 1994 coined the word '''''Prosaics'''''&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Prosaica; introducción a la estética de lo cotidiano'' (México: Grijalbo, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing a distinction from [[Aristotle]]’s '''''Poetics'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poetics (Aristotle)]]&lt;/ref&gt; focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ''Estética cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006,  ''Prácticas estéticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), ''La construcción estética del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), ''Estética y comunicación; de acción, pasión y seducción'' (Bogotá: Norma, 2007), “Quotidian Aesthetics” ''New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art. Annales d’ esthétique''. Volume 42/2003-2004. Athens: Panayotis and Effie Michelis Foundation. Pp. 103-110. ISSN 1105-0462. "L'esthétique du quotidien"  ''Diogène'' 2011/1-2 (n° 233-234). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0008.004?rgn=main;view=fulltext]
&lt;/ref&gt; consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.

== Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics ==

An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer Joseph H., ''Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study.  Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, "Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation," in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, ''La construcción estética del estado y de la identidad nacional''. (Mexico: Siglo veintiuno editores, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Berleant]] has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold ''Sensibility and Sense; The aesthetic transformation of the human world'' ( Imprint Academic 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold. 1991. Art and Engagement. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Berleant The Aesthetics of Environment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992.

== Beauty in daily life, environmental aesthetics and artification ==
[[Yi-Fu Tuan]] proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations.[http://www.yifutuan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Tuan Yi–Fu ''Passing Strange and Wonderful; Aesthetics, Nature and Culture'' (New York, Tokyo, London: Kodansha 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan,Yi–Fu. ''Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values''(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, Crispin ''The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions''. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores&lt;ref&gt;[[Eyesore]]&lt;/ref&gt; that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, Yuriko. 2008. ''Everyday Aesthetics''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business.[http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=640] Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives &lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Henao, Horacio. “Estética cotidiana y ficción: el clima como elemento
de significación en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil”. Anclajes XX. 1 (enero-abril

== Sports and food as art ==

Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;Best, David. 1988. “The Aesthetic in Sport,” in ''Philosophic Inquiry in Sport'', ed. William J. Morgan and Klaus V. Meier. Champaign: Human Kinetics Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Wolfgang "Sport–Viewed Aesthetically, and Even as Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, Lev "Aesthetics of the beautiful game" ''Soccer &amp; Society'' 2012: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste ([[Carolyn Korsmeyer]]) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Emily "Sniffing and Savoring: The Aesthetics of Smells and Tastes" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press 2005); Korsmeyer, Carolyn ''Making Sense of Taste: Food &amp; Philosophy'' (New York: Cornell University Press 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
Carolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Quinet, M.L. 1981. “Food as Art: The Problem of Function”. ''British Journal of Aesthetic''s. 21, 1: 159-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, Glenn "How Can Food Be Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The categories of the ordinary as aesthetic ==
Another line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized)&lt;ref&gt;Leddy, Thomas. 1995. 'Everyday Surface Aesthetic Qualities: "Neat", "Messy", "Clean", "Dirty"'''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', 53, 259-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leddy, Thomas''The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (Broadview Press 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).&lt;ref&gt;Irvin,Sherri “Scratching an Itch,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 66, 1 (2008), 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue eyes.JPG|thumb|[[Nazar (amulet)|Nazars]], [[amulet|charms]] used to ward off the evil eye.]]
The '''evil eye''' is a curse or legend  believed to be cast by a malevolent glare, usually given to a person when they are unaware. Many cultures believe that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=C|title=Hypothesis:The Electrophysicological Basis of the Evil Eye Belief|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3537.2010.01020.x|volume=21|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talisman]]s created to protect against the evil eye are also frequently called "evil eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil%20eye |title=Definition for "evil eye" from Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197336/evil-eye |title=evil eye (occult) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea expressed by the term causes many different cultures to pursue protective measures against it. The concept and its significance vary widely among different [[cultural diversity|cultures]], primarily in [[West Asia]]. The idea appears multiple times in [[rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref name=ulmer&gt;{{cite book |title=The evil eye in the Bible and in rabbinic literature |author=Ulmer, Rivka |editor=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=1994 |isbn=0-88125-463-0|page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwB8Hfkjpx0C&amp;pg=PA176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a widely extended belief among many Mediterranean and Asian tribes and cultures. [[Amulet|Charms]] and decorations with eye-like symbols known as [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]], which are used to repel the evil eye, are a common sight across [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], parts of [[North India]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Morocco]], southern [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Levant]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], and [[Mexico]], and have become a popular choice of souvenir with tourists.

==History==
Belief in the evil eye dates back to [[Classical antiquity]]. It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]
Classical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the "power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}

The idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: "What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?".

====Protection from the eye====
The belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', "to cast a spell" (the origin of the English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye. They have been found throughout Europe and into the Middle East from contexts dating from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes?

In describing their ability to deflect the Evil Eye, [[Ralph Merrifield]] described the Roman phallic charm as a "kind of lightning conductor for bad luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Merrifield, R. |date=1969 |title=Roman London |place=London |publisher=Cassell |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|right|Tree with nazars in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]].]]
Belief in the evil eye is strongest in [[West Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]], [[Central America]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]], especially the [[Mediterranean region]]; it has also spread to areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the [[Celts|Celtic]] regions, and the [[Americas]], where it was brought by European colonists and West Asian immigrants.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Belief in the evil eye is found in the [[Islam]]ic doctrine, based upon the statement of Prophet [[Muhammad]], "The influence of an evil eye is a fact..." [Sahih Muslim, Book 26, Number 5427].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427 |title=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2007-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903081746/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427#026.5427 |archive-date=2007-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic practices of warding off the evil eye are also commonly practiced by Muslims: rather than directly expressing appreciation of, for example, a child's beauty, it is customary to say ''[[Masha'Allah]]'', that is, "God has willed it", or invoking God's blessings upon the object or person that is being admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=118 |title=Du'a – What to say when in fear of afflicting something or someone with one?s eye |publisher=Makedua.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of beliefs about the evil eye are also found in [[folk religion]], typically revolving around the use of [[amulet]]s or [[talisman]]s as a means of protection.

In the [[Aegean Region]] and other areas where light-colored eyes are relatively rare, people with [[eye color|green eyes]], and especially blue eyes, are thought to bestow the curse, intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Lynn Daniels, et al., eds, ''Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Volume III), p. 1273, Univ. Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, {{ISBN|1-4102-0916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Greece and Turkey amulets against the evil eye take the form of blue eyes, and in the painting by John Phillip, below, we witness the culture-clash experienced by a woman who suspects that the artist's gaze implies that he is looking at her with the evil eye.

Among those who do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because they simply do not believe it, the phrase, "to give someone the evil eye" usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the [[English language]]. Within the broadcasting industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He may sound like a Dalek doing a bad impression of Kenneth Williams, but why DO so many BBC stars want to exterminate Pesto?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063409/He-sound-like-Dalek-doing-bad-impression-Kenneth-Williams-DO-BBC-stars-want-exterminate-Pesto.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective talismans and cures==
[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Hamsa]], a charm made to ward off the evil eye.]]
Attempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of [[amulet|talismans]] in many cultures. As a class, they are called "''apotropaic''" (Greek for "prophylactic" / προφυλακτικός or "protective", literally: "turns away") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.

Disks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].

Known as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncuğu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarlık}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.
[[File:Hotamis Kilim .jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Haç) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: Çengel), both to ward off the evil eye&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;]]

A blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means "five" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.

A [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Haç) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: Çengel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: Göz) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A.

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] are also strong believers in the evil eye. They will usually wear a blue/turquoise bead around a necklace to be protected from the evil eye. Also, they might pinch the [[buttocks]], comparable to Armenians. It is said that people with green or blue eyes are more prone to the evil eye effect. {{Citation needed|reason=What is the source for this statement? Was it racially motivated in any way?

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant.

===In Judaism===
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clay hamsa with an inscription in Hebrew (translates to "good luck")]]
The evil eye is mentioned several times in the classic ''[[Pirkei Avot]] (Ethics of Our Fathers)''. In Chapter II, five disciples of Rabbi [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] give advice on how to follow the good path in life and avoid the bad. [[Rabbi Eliezer]] says an evil eye is worse than a bad friend, a bad neighbor, or an evil heart.

Judaism believes that a "good eye" designates an attitude of good will and kindness towards others. Someone who has this attitude in life will rejoice when his fellow man prospers; he will wish everyone well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Magic_and_the_Supernatural/Practices_and_Beliefs/Amulets/Evil_Eye.shtml |title=Evil Eye in Judaism |publisher=My Jewish Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; An "evil eye" denotes the opposite attitude. A man with "an evil eye" will not only feel no joy but experience actual distress when others prosper, and will rejoice when others suffer. A person of this character represents a great danger to our moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters of the Fathers, Translation &amp; Commentary by Samson Raphael Hirsch, Feldheim Publishers, {{ISBN|0-87306-182-9}} pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] explained that the evil eye is "an example of how one soul may affect another through unseen connections between them. We are all influenced by our environment.... The evil eye is the venomous impact from malignant feelings of jealousy and envy of those around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Observant Jews avoid talking about valuable items they own, good luck that has come to them and, in particular, their children. If any of these are mentioned, the speaker and/or listener will say ''b'li ayin hara'' (Hebrew), meaning "without an evil eye", or ''kein eina hara'' (Yiddish; often shortened to ''kennahara''), "no evil eye". Another way to ward off the evil eye is to spit three times (or pretend to). Romans call this custom "despuere malum," to spit at evil. &lt;ref&gt;Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic. "The Whole Spiel: Funny essays about digital nudniks, seder selfies and chicken soup memories," Incompra Press, {{ISBN|978-0-692-72625-9}} pg. 153 &lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested {{by whom|date=June 2016}} the 10th commandment: "do not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor" is a law against bestowing the evil eye on another person.

===Ethiopia===
{{Main article|Buda (folk religion)}}
Belief in the evil eye, or ''[[Buda (folk religion)|buda]]'' (var. ''bouda''), is widespread in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, John W. "Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity: Faith and practices". ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]''. Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds. Washington: Library of Congress Federal Research Division, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Buda is generally believed to be a power held and wielded by those in a different social group, for example among the metalworkers.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], the evil eye is called ''Nazar'' (نظر). People usually may resort to reading the last three chapters of the Quran, namely [[Al-Ikhlas|Sura Ikhlas]], [[Al-Falaq|Sura Al-Falaq]] and [[Al-Nas|Sura Al-Nas]]. "[[Masha'Allah]]" ({{rtl-lang|ar|ما شاء الله}}) ("God has willed it") is commonly said to ward off the evil eye. Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use "[[taawiz]]" to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ghilzai, S.A., and Kanwal, A.

===Greece===
The evil eye, known as {{lang|el|μάτι}} (''mati''), "eye", as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] visual device, is known to have been a fixture in Greece dating back to at least the 6th century BC, when it commonly appeared on drinking vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster. ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|ξεμάτιασμα}}), whereby the "healer" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it." [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and "healer" then start yawning profusely. The "healer" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].

Another "test" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the "healer" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.

There is another form of the "test" where the "healer" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be λόγια - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying φτου να μη σε ματιάξω! which translates to "I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye." Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.

The [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|βασκανία}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|Μέγαν Ιερόν Συνέκδημον}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}

===Italy===
[[File:Fig._81_-_The_Evil_Eye_-_Elworthy.jpg|thumb|left|Various evil eye amulets from Italy such as the [[cornicello]], [[cimaruta]], and [[lunula (amulet)|lunula]] (1895).]]
The [[cornicello]], "little horn", also called the ''cornetto'' ("little horn", plural ''cornetti''), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African [[Taurotragus|eland]] or a chili pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Corno (Italian Horn Amulet)|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/corno.html|author=Lucky Mojo|access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea that the [[ribaldry|ribald]] suggestions made by sexual [[symbol]]s distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, [[statue]]s of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans. In [[Latin America]], carvings of the fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers continue to be carried as good luck charms.

The wielder of the evil eye, the ''jettatore'', is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his black eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. [[Pope Pius IX]] was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence. ''The Evil Eye''.

===Malta===
The symbol of the eye, known as "l-għajn", is common on traditional fishing boats which are known as [[luzzu]]. They are said to protect fishermen from storms and malicious intentions. &lt;ref&gt; {{ siteweb | url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/il-qoxra-tradizzjona-traa-traditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineali-li-kulma-tmur-qed-tonqos/
}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Latin America===
The evil eye or 'Mal de Ojo' has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.

In [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye (see ''mal de ojo'', above) and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.

One traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnografía Clásica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Flórez, Franz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Brazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' ("act of giving a bad look") or ''olho gordo'' ("fat eye" i.e. "gluttonous eye") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.

Unlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. "Pagans" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.

Nevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.

Amulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ninguém-pode'' ("against-me-nobody-cans"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-são-jorge'' ("St. George's sword"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guiné'' ("Guinea"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to "sanitize" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' ("seven [lucky] herbs") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjericão'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conheça o poder e a proteção das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)
Other popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Mal ojo often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: "Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&amp;nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the "hot" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, "the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations."&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Nazar Battu}}
In the northern states of India, like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called "Drishti" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: "buri nazar wale tera muh kala" ("O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black").

In general in India, if gone through time up to historical myths, babies and newborn infants will have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti'. To remove Disti people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items used to remove Disti either Rock salt or Red chilies or Oiled cloth. Taking one of this item, people remove Disti by rotating their hand with one of the item above around the person who affected by Disti and they will burn the item.&lt;ref name="JackStephen2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&amp;pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures over-complimenting is said to cast a curse. So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faux paint sample 1.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of faux paintings.]]
[[Image:zebra wood.jpg|right|thumb|Example of the faux painting of a wood design]]
'''Faux painting''' or '''faux finishing''' are terms used to describe decorative paint finishes that replicate the appearance of materials such as marble, wood or stone.&lt;ref&gt;Shekhar, R.K.C. (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLRZlNuSTMkC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;f=false Academic Dictionary of Architecture]''. Delhi: Isha Books, p. 110. {{ISBN|9788182051850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the French word [[wikt:faux|faux]], meaning false, as these  techniques started as a form of replicating materials such as marble and wood with paint, but has subsequently come to encompass many other decorative finishes for walls and furniture including simulating recognisable textures and surfaces.

== History ==
Faux finishing has been used for millennia, from [[cave painting]] to the tombs of [[ancient Egypt]], but what we generally think of as faux finishing in the [[decorative art]]s began with [[plaster]] and [[stucco]] finishes in [[Mesopotamia]] over 5,000 years ago.

Faux painting became popular in classical times in the forms of faux [[marble]], faux [[wood]], and [[trompe l'oeil]] [[murals]].  Artists would apprentice for 10 years or more with a master faux painter before working on their own.  Great recognition was awarded to artists who could actually trick viewers into believing their work was the real thing.  Faux painting has continued to be popular throughout the ages, but experienced major resurgences in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] revival of the nineteenth century and the [[Art Deco]] styles of the 1920s.  During the recent history of decorative painting, faux finishing has been mainly used in commercial and public spaces.

==20th century revival==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, faux finishing saw another major revival, as [[wallpaper]] began to fall out of fashion.  At this point, faux painting became extremely popular in home environments, with high-end homes leading the trend.   While it can be quite expensive to hire a professional faux finisher($80.00/hr.), many faux painting methods are thought to be simple enough for a beginning home owner to create with a little instruction. Some, however, fail to take important details like corners into consideration and end up with a do-it-yourself looking job. Some professionally applied finishes in the high-end, Bay-Area homes of northern California, for example, were as simple as oil glaze/oil-based paint/penetrol or as complicated as applications with peacock feathers and 4 different colors applied using 4 different techniques. People are attracted to the simplicity of changing a faux finish, because it can be easily painted over compared with the trouble of removing wallpaper. Trouble with removing wallpaper comes when people who have no formal training don't follow proper procedures during preparation such as priming with an oil-based primer, then following that with another product which makes the paper come off relatively easy.

In modern-day faux finishing, there are two major materials/processes used.  [[Glaze (painting technique)|Glaze]] work involves using a translucent mixture of paint and glaze applied with a brush, roller, rag, or sponge, and often mimics textures, but it is always smooth to the touch.  Plaster work can be done with tinted plasters, or washed over with earth pigments, and is generally applied with a trowel or spatula.  The finished result can be either flat to the touch or textured.

== Faux finishes ==
* [[Marbleizing]] or faux marbling is used to make walls and furniture look like real marble.  This can be done using either plaster or glaze techniques.
* [[Fresco]] is a simple technique, uses mixtures of tint and joint compound to add mottled color and subtle texture to plain walls,
* [[Graining]], wood graining, or faux bois (French for "fake wood") is often used to imitate exotic or hard-to-find wood varieties.
* [[Trompe l'oeil]], "fool the eye" in French, is a realistic painting technique often used in murals, and to create architectural details as well as depth and 3 dimensionality. 
* [[Venetian plaster]] is a smooth and often shiny plaster design that appears textured but is smooth to the touch.  Venetian plaster is one of the most popular and traditional plaster decorations. Authentic Venetian Plaster is made from marble dust and ground up limestone.
* [[Color wash]] is a free-form finish that creates subtle variations of color using multiple hues of glaze blended together with a paint brush.
* [[Strié]], from the French for "stripe" or "streak", is a glazing technique that creates soft thin streaks of color using a paint brush.  It is a technique often used to simulate fabrics such as linen and denim.
* [[Rag painting]] or ragging is a glazing technique using twisted or bunched up rags to create a textural pattern.
* Sponging is a free-form finish achieved by applying glaze to the wall by dabbing a sea sponge, in various shapes to achieve either simple design (resembling the wall papers) and more sophisticated ones.

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent. N.p., Mar. 2012. Web. 22 Oct. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6855">'''Hohenzollernstraße''' is a two kilometer long street in [[Munich]]'s [[Schwabing]] district.

== Location ==
It starts at [[Leopoldstraße]], then crosses the Kurfürstenplatz and Hohenzollernplatz and changes after the [[Winzererstraße]] in the west to the Schwerere-Reiter-Straße as its extension. Between Kurfürstenplatz and Leopoldstraße are smaller shops. Together with Leopoldstraße the shopping street forms the so-called ''Schwabinger T''.

According to a study by the traffic data and [[Software as a service|SaaS]] provider [[INRIX]] of 2016, Hohenzollernstraße is the most heavily [[Traffic congestion|occupied road]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/wirtschaft/verkehr-studiemuenchen-ist-deutsche-stau-hauptstadt-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-170221-99-371856 | title=Studie: München ist deutsche Stau-Hauptstadt | author= | date=21 February 2017 | website= | publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the incorporation of Schwabing to Munich in 1890, the [[Burgfrieden]] around Munich ran at the height of Hohenzollernstraße.&lt;ref name="Kultur"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dam/jcr:61ca7c8f-9988-4cf2-850b-8a3e9480e111/KGP12_booklet_2aufl_screen.pdf | title=KulturGeschichtsPfad | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Landeshauptstadt München | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 the street was renamed "Hörmannstraße" after the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/muenchner-strassen-hohenzollernstrasse-kostueme-highheels-und-ein-buddha-1.1111348 | title=Kostüme, Highheels und ein Buddha | author= | date=1 July 2011 | website= | publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] founded his art school "[[Phalanx (art group)|Phalanx]]" on Hohenzollernstraße 6a, where [[Gabriele Münter]] became a pupil.&lt;ref name="Kultur" /&gt; In the house number 104, Willibald Besta had his studio there until 1929. Hohenzollernstraße 21 was the location of the 1902 founded "Lehr- und Versuchsatelier für angewandte und freikunst", of [[Wilhelm von Debschitz]] and [[Hermann Obrist]], which developed into Germany's largest private educational institution. [[Paul Klee]] taught there in 1908. In 1910 Emil Preetorius was the director of the school.

In 1910, [[Georg Kerschensteiner]] founded an experimental school in Hohenzollernstraße 14 which was built in 1905/1906. In 1938, the building was transformed into a hospital, which from 1945 to 1960 served as the "Chirurgisches Krankenhaus München-Nord". In 1961, a high school took its place, where for example, Michael Lerchenberg went to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wochenanzeiger.de/article/64054.html | title=Schwabing · Platz für Unfugspotential | author= | date=21 November 2006 | website= | publisher=Münchner Wochenanzeiger | language=German | accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1941, between Zentnerstraße and [[Schleißheimer Straße (Munich)|Schleissheimer Straße]], on Hohenzollernstraße is the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] styled Nordbad, which includes a grandstand for 1,400 spectators.

From the Kurfürstenplatz to the west, the [[Trams in Munich|tram lines]] 12 and 27 run over Hohenzollernstraße.

In the 1970s, the section between Nikolaiplatz and Kurfürstenplatz was no longer used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63885">{{about|insufflation in religion and magic rituals|the medical practice of blowing substances into body cavities|Insufflation (medicine)}}

In religious and magical practice, '''insufflation''' and '''[[exsufflation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Insufflation (from [[Latin]] word elements meaning "a blowing on") and exsufflation ("a blowing out") often cannot be distinguished in usage, and so are considered together in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or puffing that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil or of the [[devil]] (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] or [[Divine grace|grace of God]]).

In historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the [[liturgy]], and is connected almost exclusively with [[baptism]] and other ceremonies of [[Christian]] [[initiation]], achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or [[exorcism|exorcistic]] significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Franz Josef Dölger]], Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums 3 (Paderborn, 1909), chap. 7 "Die Exsufflatio" (pp. 118-130); Edmond Martène, De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus libri tres (Venice, 1763), I.1.viii-xiv ("Ritus instituendi catechumeni"); Rudolf Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9. bis 13. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978), pp. 307-310; and Henry A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Theology, and Drama (Ithaca, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual blowing occurs in the liturgies of [[catechumenate]] and [[baptism]] from a very [[Early Christianity|early period]] and survives into the modern [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite]], and [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside Martène and Suntrup (cited above), convenient collections of illustrative material include W. G. Henderson, ed., Manuale et Processionale ad usum insignis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 63 (Durham, 1875 for 1874), especially Appendix III "Ordines Baptismi" [cited below as York Manual]; Joseph Aloysius Assemanus, Codex liturgicus ecclesiae universae, I: De Catechumenis and II: De Baptismo (Rome, 1749; reprinted Paris and Leipzig, 1902); J. M. Neale, ed., The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church...together with Parallel Passages from the Roman, Ambrosian, and Mozarabic Rites (London, 1855; rpt. New York, 1970); Enzo Lodi, Enchiridion euchologicum fontium liturgicorum (Rome, 1978); Johannes Quaesten, ed., Monumenta eucharistica et liturgica vetustissima, Florilegium Patristicum tam veteris quam medii aevi auctores complectens, ed.

Finn, Early Christian Baptism and the Catechumenate: Italy, North Africa, and Egypt (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic liturgy post-[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (the so-called ''novus ordo'' 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of [[chrism]] on [[Maundy Thursday]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., rev. by F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone (Oxford, 1998), ''s.v.'' "insufflation," p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant liturgies typically abandoned it very early on. The [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Catholic liturgy]] retained both an insufflation of the baptismal water and (like the present-day Orthodox and Maronite rites)&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., 840. For the Maronite rite, derived from the ancient Syriac liturgy, see Mysteries of Initiation, Baptism, Confirmation, Communion according to the Maronite Antiochene Church, (Washington, DC, 1987); summarized by Bryan D. Spinks, Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism..., (Aldershot, Hants., 2006), 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; an exsufflation of the candidate for baptism, right up to the 1960s:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;[THE INSUFFLATION] ''He breathes thrice upon the waters in the form of a cross, saying:'' Do You with Your mouth bless these pure waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also be effectual for purifying the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Daily Missal..., by Dom Gaspar Lefebvre (Bruges [Belgium]: Biblica, 1962), 492 [liturgy for the Easter vigil].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;THE EXSUFFLATION. ''The priest breathes three times on the child in the form of a cross, saying:'' Go out of him...you [[unclean spirit]] and give place to the Holy Spirit, the [[Paraclete]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Missal (Bruges, 1962), 1768 [ceremonies of baptism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insufflation vs. exsufflation==

From an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically "exsufflation" ("blowing out") and the latter "insufflation" ("blowing in"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin ''insufflare'' ('blow in') and ''exsufflare'' ('blow out'), or their Greek or [[vernacular]] equivalents, but also the simplex ''sufflare'' ('blow'), ''halare'' ('breathe'), ''inspirare'', ''exspirare'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;P. Pashini, ''et al.,'' ed., Enciclopedia Cattolica (Florence, 1949-1954), ''s.v.'' "insufflazione," pp. 55-56. Compare Neale, The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church..., p. 266, note m; Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, p. 256; Kelly, The Devil at Baptism, p. 235. Döger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, p. 130 similarly distinguishes between exsufflation and "halation"; and Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden, p. 307 warns that the distinction is a hard one to maintain. The Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, ''s.v. insufflation'' (accessed 14 Jan 2007) similarly says that "the distinction between insufflation and exsufflation has not always been preserved." And the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., p. 839, is content to give both inspirational ("to symbolize the influence of the Holy Spirit") and exorcistic ("the expulsion of evil spirits") meanings under the single heading of "insufflation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical is the 8th-century ''Libellus de mysterio baptismatis'' of [[Magnus of Sens]], one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by [[Charlemagne]]. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions≈

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of them, and that entry for the Lord [[Christ]] might be prepared, and that by his insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Latina, 102:982D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This double role appears as early as [[Cyril of Jerusalem]]'s 4th-century ''Mystagogic Catacheses''; as Edward Yarnold notes, "Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. … The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation)."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, by Edward J. Yarnold (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early period===

What might neutrally be called "sufflation" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the "[[catechumenate]]," which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:&lt;ref&gt;The date is controversial. The text is usually connected with practice in Rome and dated in its earliest form to the early 3rd century. But the surviving text is fragmentary, many portions surviving only in much later versions in several different languages. Chapter 20, the relevant chapter, is perhaps from the 4th century (see Maxwell E. Johnson, The Rites of Christian Initiation: Their Evolution and Interpretation (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), 78-81). For the standard reconstruction of the text, see Bernard Botte, La "Tradition Apostolique," 42-45 (chapter 20). Whitaker, Documents, p. 4, reprints the translation of Gregory Dix, The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition, p. 32 (sect. xx.8). Botte renders the Coptic original of the sufflation passage as "exsufflet," though Kelly (Devil at Baptism, p. 87) points out that the significance of the gesture is uncertain. Geoffrey Cumming gives the more neutral translation "breathe on": Hippolytus: A Text for Students (Bramcote, Notts, 1976), p. 18, as reproduced more fully below.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who are to be baptized should … be gathered in one place. … And [the bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has finished exorcizing them, '''he shall breathe on their faces;''' and when he has signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.&lt;ref&gt;Cuming's translation, reprinted by Maxwell Johnson, Rites of Christian Initiation, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distribution, geographical and functional===

The practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine [[infant baptism]], was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of [[Augustine]] and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western [[high Middle Ages]] of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and [[wikt:baptizand|baptizands]],&lt;ref&gt;Nearly universally. E.g. (1) in Egypt: Canons of Hippolytus, Canon 19 (or §110), trans. Riedel 211, Achelis 93, Whitaker 88; Horner's translations of the Ethiopic, Arabic, and Sahidic versions may be found on pp. 152, 252, and 316. (2) In western Syria: Cyril, Procatechesis, cap. 9, ed.

(5) In the Byzantine and other eastern rites: see, e.g., Lodi, 1303 (§2925) and Whitaker, 74; the eastern rites are treated extensively by Kelly, 136-200.

G. Henderson, ed., Liber Pontificalis Chr. Bainbridge Archiepiscopi Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 61 (Durham, 1875 for 1873), 254, 256).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===

Most of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum|Romano-Germanic]] rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the [[Council of Trent]], and beyond that into modern ([[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]]) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian tradition]] in [[northern Italy]] and the Spanish [[Mozarabic rite]] faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western [[Christendom]], including [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[medieval England]], from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious [[John the Deacon (Church of Rome)|John the Deacon]] to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length.&lt;ref&gt;John the Deacon, Epistola ad Senarium,  ed. [[A. Wilmart]], "Analecta Reginensia (Vat. Reg. Lat. 69)," Studi e testi 59 (1933), 172; trans. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stowe Missal]], Irish in origin but largely [[Gallican Rite|Gallican]] in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church (Oxford, 1881; rpt. with introduction by Jane Stevenson, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1987), 209; The Stowe Missal, ed. George F. Warner, Henry Bradshaw Society 32 (London, 1915), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called [[Gallican rite#Missale Gothicum|Missale Gothicum]] contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 97; or L. C. Mohlberg, ed., Missale Gothicum, Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Series Maior, Fontes 5 (Rome, 1961), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid [[Celtic Rite#The Bobbio Missal|Bobbio Missal]]&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 266&lt;/ref&gt; and the 10th-century [[Fulda]] [[sacramentary]], alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation.&lt;ref&gt;Fulda Sacramentary, 332 (§2631) and 343 (§2679-80).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the [[Ambrosian Library]] MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates ''in modum crucis'', and insufflation of the font as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, North Italian Services, 5, 11, 16, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hadrianum" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by [[Benedict of Aniane]], contains an insufflation of the baptismal font,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Deshusses, Le Sacramentaire Grégorien, vol. 1, Spicilegium Friburgense 16 (Fribourg, 1971), 188; the rubric here is reconstructed by Deshusses from a wide variety of variants. On the attribution of the Hadrianum supplement to Benedict, see Deshusses, 1:63-7 and vol. 3, Spicilegium Friburgense 28 (Fribourg, 1982), 66-75, as well as his earlier article "Le 'Supplément' au sacramentaire grégorien: Alcuin ou S. Benoît d'Aniane?" Archiv für Liturgiewissenschaft 9.1 (1965): 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mid-10th-century ''Ordo Romanus L'',&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xxxix.50; Michel Andrieu, ed., Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Age, vol. 5, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 29 (Louvain, 1961), 281.&lt;/ref&gt; the basis of the later Roman pontifical. ''Ordo Romanus L'' also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xx.5; Andrieu, 5:131. This section was probably also originally found in Ordo XI according to Andrieu (2:376).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the numerous [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Explications du rituel baptismal à l'époque carolingienne," Revue des études augustiniennes 24 (1978): 278-301; and Susan A. Keefe, "Carolingian Baptismal Expositions: A Handlist of Tracts and MSS," in Carolingian Essays, ed. Uta-Renate Blumenthal (Washington, DC, 1983), 169-238.&lt;/ref&gt; One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;[[André Wilmart]], "Une catéchèse baptismale du IX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle," Revue Bénédictine 57 (1947): 199 (Keefe, "Expositions," text 50).&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the [[tract (literature)|tract]]s and [[florilegium|florilegia]], when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially [[Isidore]] and [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Keefe's texts 34/6 and 3: Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Alcuin et le 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,'" Recherches Augustiniennes 15 (1980): 224; and Wilmart, Analecta, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being ("God's creature") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin,&lt;ref&gt;''Sciendum est quod non creatura Dei in infantibus exorcizatur aut exufflatur, sed ille sub quo sunt omnes qui cum peccato nascuntur; est enim princeps peccatorum''. Etymologiarum,VI.xix.56; ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; a remark that echoed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s arguments against the [[Pelagians]] to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called ''Primo paganus'', which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin's comments are contained in two genuine letters (numbers 134, to Odwin, and 137, to monks in the south of France), ed. Ernst Dümmler, Epistolae Karolini Aevi, 2, MGH Epistolae 4 (Berlin, 1895), 202 and 214; and in a third letter of dubious authenticity, ostensibly to Charlemagne, ed. Patrologia Latina 98:938B. The three letters are nearly verbatim identical in their description of exsufflation: ''Primo paganus catechumenus fit, accedens ad baptismum; ut renuntiet maligno spiritui et omnibus eius pompis. Exsufflatur etiam; ut, fugato diabolo, Christo Deo nostro paretur introitus'' (MGH, 214, = Keefe text 9, Bouhot, 280-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Primo paganus'' formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious.&lt;ref&gt;For the various replies, see Wilmart, 154; Bouhot, 286-93; and Keefe, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the ''Libellus'' of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents.&lt;ref&gt;The Libellus of Magnus of Sens is Keefe's text 15 (Bouhot, 287).&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced — it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is he breathed upon? (''cur exsufflatur?'') why is he exorcised?"&lt;ref&gt;See J. D. C. Fisher, Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West (London, 1965), 59. The text (Keefe's text 14; Bouhot, 286) is readily available in Dorothy Bethurum's edition of the Homilies of Wulfstan (Oxford, 1957), 302-3, and less readily in Jean Michel Hanssens, Amalarii...opera 1, Studi e test 138 (1948), 235-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for.

====In England====

On the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]]'s collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the ''Incipit de baptisma'', and in the two vernacular ([[Old English]]) [[homily|homilies]] based on it, the ''Quando volueris'' and the ''Sermo de baptismate''. The ''Incipit de baptisma'' reads: "On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared."&lt;ref&gt;''In cuius … facie a sacerdote per exsufflationem signum crucis sit, ut effugeto diabolo, Cristo Domino nostro preparetur introitus''. Wulfstan, Homilies, ed. Bethurum, Homily VIIIa (p. 169, ll. 8-10). For the relationship between the three pieces, see pp. 302-4. For the parallel passages in the vernacular homilies, see Homily VIIIb (p. 172, ll. 14-22) and Homily VIIIc (pp. 176-7, ll. 29-35). Wulfstan's collection draws on a variety of Carolingian sources, but in this passage quotes almost verbatim the De Ordine Baptismi of Theodulf of Orleans (yet another Alcuin-derivative reply to Charlemagne; Keefe text 16), ed. in Patrologia Latina 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, ed., The Leofric Missal as used in the Cathedral of Exeter during the Episcopate of its First Bishop, A. D. 1050-1072 (Oxford, 1883), 236-37, 259. This text may, however, originate on the Continent: see H. M. J. Bantin, Two Anglo-Saxon Pontificals, Henry Bradshaw Society 104 (London, 1989), xxiii-xxv. The contemporary, and genuinely English, Egbert Pontifical, from York, lacks mention of sufflation.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, the ''Salisbury Pontifical'' (BL [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] C.1) and the ''Pontifical'' of [[Thomas of Canterbury]] require insufflation of the font; the ''Missal'' of [[Robert of Jumièges]] (Canterbury) has an erased [[rubric]] where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old ''ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum,'' complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English ''Ordo Romanus'' (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Henderson, ed., York Manual, 144, 136, 133, 142; H. A. Wilson, ed., The Missal of Robert of Jumiège, Henry Bradshaw Society 11 (London, 1896), 93, 98, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Various 12th-century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font ''in modum crucis'' (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts).&lt;ref&gt;See the Bainbridge Pontifical, appendix 3, 254; York Manual, 147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism.

===Sufflation in Protestantism===

Sufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. [[Martin Luther]]'s first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufbüchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the [[adiaphora]] — i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely '''breathing under the eyes,''' signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism. For … they are not the kind of devices that the devil shuns."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works 53:103, Weimar Ausgabe 12:48; cited in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lutheran Strasbourg ''Taufbüchlein'' of June 1524, composed by [[Diobald Schwartz]], assistant to Cathedral preacher [[Martin Zell]], on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation;&lt;ref&gt;Text in F. Hubert, Die Strassburger liturgischen Ordnungen in Zeitalter der Reformation (Göttingen: Vandenhoek und Ruprecht, 1900), 25ff.; transl. in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; so does [[Andreas Osiander]] in Nuremberg, in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Christian Initiation, 18. The dependence of Schwartz and Osiander on Luther appears from their use of his distinctive rubric "breathe ''under the eyes''" — not found in the medieval rites.&lt;/ref&gt;

But thereafter the practice vanished from [[Lutheranism]], and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England ([[Thomas Cranmer]]'s Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of [[Olavus Petri]]), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.&lt;ref&gt;For a handy comparison, see The Manual of Olavus Petri, 1529, ed. Eric E. Yelverton (London: SPCK, 1953), p. [110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 126ff.; discussed briefly in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 31, and fully in H. O. Old, The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufflation in Protestant-Roman Catholic debate===

Though sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant [[polemic]], where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of [[Henry More]] (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): "you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth." More replies, in effect, "Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous," in a word "the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery":
   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. … And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the [[Styx|Stygian]] Fiend, as to Exorcize him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once."&lt;ref&gt;Henry More, A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity (London, 1664), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite [[Church Father|Father]], Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall tradition.... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Davy Du Perron, The reply of the most illustrious Cardinall of Perron, to the ansvveare of the most excellent King of Great Britaine (Douay. 1630) 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey Leech]]; [[Robert Persons]], Dutifull and respective considerations vpon foure seuerall heads of proofe and triall in matters of religion  ... By a late minister &amp; preacher in England (Saint-Omer, 1609), 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient ''enough'', and could not be proved to be apostolic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition  in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and  S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor, Treatises of 1. The liberty of prophesying, 2. Prayer ex tempore, 3. Episcopacie : together with a sermon preached at Oxon.... (London, 1648), 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of [[the Enlightenment]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by Ceremonies. To Baptism were then added the tasting of Milk and  Honey,  Anointing, the Sign of the Cross, a white Garment, &amp;amp;c. ... But in later times there was no end of Lights, Exorcisms, Exsufflations, and many other Extravagancies of Jewish, or Heathen Original ... for there is nothing like these in the Writings of the Apostles, but they are all plainly contain'd in the Books of the Gentiles, and was the Substance of their Worship."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, Christianity Not Mysterious, Or, A Treatise Shewing that there is Nothing in The Gospel Contrary to Reason, nor Above it and that no Christian Doctrine can be Properly Call'd a Mystery (London, 1696), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine-immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the Devil... Thus, I say, that inundation of abominable corruptions, which at present overwhelms both the Greek and Romish Churches, gradually came in at this very breech which you are now zealously maintaining, namely, the Bishop's Power to decree rites and ceremonies in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Micaiah Towgood]], A dissent from the Church of England fully justified, 5th ed. (London, 1779),&lt;!-- ECCO id no. CW3321486367--&gt; p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
To all of which, Roman Catholic apologists replied that insufflation was not only ancient and Apostolic, but had been practiced by Christ himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When he [Christ] had said this he breathed upon them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Ghost...." When the Pastors of our Church use the Insufflation or Breathing upon any, for the like mystical Signification, you cry aloud, Superstition, Superstition, an apish mimical action, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;James Mumford, The Catholic scripturist, or the plea of the Roman Catholics, 4th ed. (London(?), 1767),&lt;!-- ECCO doc number CW3320627310--&gt; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prospects===

Though liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic "new catechumenate." But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades.  Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the [[Roman Catholicism in Africa|Roman Catholic Church in Africa]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Asia|in Asia]], where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the [[Philippine Independent Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jagger, Christian Initiation 1552-1969... (London, 1970), 292. This is basically a Roman rite with some Anglican-like features.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the [[Christian Workers' Fellowship]] of [[Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 203, citing Francis Wickremesinghe, "An Asian Inculturation of the Baptismal Liturgy," in David R. Holeton, ed., Growing in Newness of Life (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1993), 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom.

==Significance and associations==

There were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: [[Biblical]] antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs.

===Biblical antecedents===

Three Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7}} (echoed by {{bibleverse||Wisdom|15:11}} and {{bibleverse||Job|33:4}}), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul.&lt;ref&gt;"His life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit [Vulg. 'insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem']" Wisdom 15:10-11 (RSV); "The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life" Job 33:4 (RSV). Cp. Psalm 33:6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second passage, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:9}}, reinterprets the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled [[Israelites|Israel]] by means of his life-giving breath.&lt;ref&gt;"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain [Vulg. 'insuffla super interfectos istos'], that they may live.... And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet" Ezekiel 37:9-10 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, in {{bibleverse||John|20:22}}, Christ is represented as conveying the [[Paraclete]] to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation.&lt;ref&gt;"He breathed [on them?] [Vulg. ''insufflavit''] and said to them, 'receive the Holy Spirit'" John 20:22 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]], ed. John Bagwell, ''A complete Christian dictionary wherein the significations and several acceptations of all the words mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are fully opened, expressed, explained ...'' (London, 1661) p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. … We must not understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a simple and perfect Spirit; but … as a figurative expression of God's communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. … The Learned P. Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. ''Insufflatio illa Dei:'' This Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, contributes unto him ''aliquid de suo'' somewhat of his own: And therefore, saith he, when our B. Saviour would communicate his Spirit to his Disciples, he did it with Insufflation, breathing on them, thereby to signifie, ''se Divinum &amp; de suo quiddam illis contribuere'' [i.e., that he was himself divine and was infusing something of his own into them]."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Camfield, A theological discourse of angels and their ministries wherein their existence, nature, number, order and offices are modestly treated of … . (London, 1678) 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of  Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in [[Saint Paul]]'s metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 6:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous [[Old Testament]] passages in which "the breath of God" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction — an expression of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]: "by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed" (Job 4:9, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Isaiah 11:4 ("with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: "The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord [[Jesus]] will slay him with the breath of his mouth" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. [[Jesse of Amiens]], for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: ""Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 34:5 (RSV) (Vulg. 35:5); Jesse of Amiens, Patrologia Latina 105:786D.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Thomas]] describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, "Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name."&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Thomas, §157; trans. in New Testament Apocrypha, ed. Edgar Hennecke; rev. by Wilhelm Schneemelcher; trans. R. McL. Wilson (Cambridge, 1992), 2:401. The Biblical allusion is apparently to John 18.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

God's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: "I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Vulg. "In igne furoris mei sufflabo in te." Cp. the fiery brimstone breath of God in Isaiah 30:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his [[catechetical]] sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis XX.3, Patrologia Graeca 33:1079/80; trans. Gifford, 147. In the pre-catechetical lectures he seems to combine the fire of God's wrath and the Biblical motif of the refiner's fire (Malachi 3:2, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18): "as the goldsmith..., as it were breathing on the gold which is hid in the hollow of the forge, stimulates the flame it acts upon and so obtains what he is seeking; so also exorcizers..., setting the soul on fire in the crucible of the body, make the evil spirit flee." Procatechesis §9; ed. F. L. Cross, 5-6 (Patrologia Graeca 33:347/8-349/350); trans. Cross, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]] is reported to have said, "are purged by exorcisms as by fire":&lt;ref&gt;Nicetas quoted in Bouhot, De catechizandis rudibus, 225 (§67).&lt;/ref&gt; "we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed."&lt;ref&gt;Liber Ordinum, ed. Férotin, 75; trans. in Kelly, 248 (cp. 237-37). Cp. Lambot, North Italian Services, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical context===

More importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the [[Paschal vigil]] — a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the "new fire," and the singing of the ''[[Exultet]]'' and the ''[[Lumen Christi]].'' The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the [[benediction]] of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle.&lt;ref&gt;Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xxv.2 (ed. Hanssens, 2:134-5) and I.xxvi (2:136-8); the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. Dumas, 99 (§704d); many manuscripts of the Hadrianum (ed. Deshusses 1:188, §374e); Ordo Romanus L xxxix.50 (ed. Andrieu 5:280-1); the Missal of Robert of Jumiège, 98-9; the York Manual, 15, 136*, 144*, 149*, 153*; Suntrup, 417-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued with the Holy Ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homily VIIIb (ed. Bethurum, p. 173, ll. 39-43); cp. Homily VIIIa (p. 170, ll. 36-40) and Homily VIIIc (p. 179, ll. 73-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;The exsufflated person is exorcised so that ... having been delivered from the power of darkness, he might be translated into the kingdom ... of God.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmart, 172; thence also in many of the Carolingian expositions, e.g. in Keefe's tet 32, ed. Friedrich Stegmüller, "Bischof Angilmodus über die Taufe...," Römische Quartalschrift für Christliche Altertumskunde und Kirchengeschichte 52 (1957): 20; and text 25, the tract by Archbishop Liedrad of Lyons, Patrologia Latina 99:856D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
So also Augustine ("The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them"&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum (opus imperf.) 1.50, ed. Michaela Zelzer, [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 85/1 (Vienna, 1974), 43 (Patrologia Latina 45:1073) Cp. 3.182, CSEL 85/1, 482 (PL 45:1323); the Contra Julianum 1.4.14 (PL 44:649), 1.5.19 (PL 44:653), 3.3.8 (PL 44:705), 3.5.11 (PL 44:707-8), and 6.5.11 (PL 44:828-9); and the Ennarationes in Psalmos 76.4, ed. E. Dekkers and J. Fraipont, CCSL 39 (1956), 1055.&lt;/ref&gt;), and Isidore ("The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord"&lt;ref&gt;De ecclesiastics officiis, II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson,  CCSL 113 (1989), 96/20-24 (PL 83:815A), and thence into various Carolingian texts, e.g. the Pseudo-Maxentius Collectanea (= Keefe text 37), PL 106:54C.&lt;/ref&gt;).

And as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other,&lt;ref&gt;Mohlberg, Sacramentarium Gelasianum 93 (§598) ("exsufflas in faciem eius et facis ei crucem in fronte"); the same doublet is applied to the baptismal water in the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. A. Dumas, Liber Sacramentorum Gellonensis, CCSL 159 (1981), 335 (§2317-18) and 346 (§2379), and in the North Italian rituals, ed. Lambot, 33. Signing precedes and follows in the Missale Gothicum, ed. Neale, 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In [[Raban Maur]]'s discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Knöpfler, ed., Rabani Mauri de institutione clericorum, Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchen-historischen Seminar München 5 (Munich, 1900), I.xxvii, p. 48 (PL 107:311D-12A).&lt;/ref&gt; The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the [[Syriac Chritianity|Syriac Rite]] described by [[James of Edessa]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Documents, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern Coptic rite,&lt;ref&gt;Lodi, 1557&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 9th-century ''Ordo Romanus XXXI'',&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu, 3:502, §80 ("Anhelet in modum cruce").&lt;/ref&gt; in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their [[Continental Europe|Continental]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homilies (ed. Bethurum), Homily VIIIa, p. 16; Theodulf of Orleans, De ordine baptismi, PL 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font,&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, 143, 145&lt;/ref&gt; in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites,&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, 5, 6, 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals,&lt;ref&gt;York Manual, 144* (11th century), 149* (12th century), 150* (13th century), and 153* (15th century).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Sarum Missal]],&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Legg, ed., [[Sarum Missal]], 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Andrieu, Le Pontifical Romain au Moyen Age (Vatican City, 1940), 2:514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-liturgical (hagiographic and magical) use==

===Patristic period===

There are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. [[Tertullian]] is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra-liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men "by our touch and by our breath," and are thus "carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment]."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Apologeticus, 23.15-16, ed. Henricus Hoppe, CSEL 69 (1939), 67; trans. by [[A. Souter]], Apology (Cambridge, 1917), 82/83. Cp. De Anima, 1.5, ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 782.&lt;/ref&gt; He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for [[polytheism|polytheistic]] altars), "with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De idolatria XI.7, ed. and tr. [[J. H. Waszink]] and J. C. M. Van Winden, Vigiliae Christianae Supplements 1 (Leiden, 1987), 42-5 (commentary, 210); also ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 111; trans. S. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, 3:68.&lt;/ref&gt; And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--see talk--&gt; "[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Ad uxorem suam II.v.3, ed. and trans. Claude Munier, Tertullien: "A son Epouse," Sources Chrétiennes 273 (Paris, 1980), 138 (CCSL 1 (1954), 389; PL 1:1296); trans. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers 4:46.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. [[Eusebius]], for example, says of the saints that they were men "who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' VII.x.4, ed. Eduard Schwartz, Eusebius Werke 2.2, Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, 9 (Leipzig, 1908), 650 (Patrologia Graeca 20:659/60); trans. Arthur C. McGiffert, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 1:298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] describes the right response to [[Gnostic]] doctrine as "reviling" (καταφυσησαντας; literally ''exsufflantes'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.16.3, ed. A. Rousseau and Louis Doutreleau, Contre les Hérésies 1, Sources Chrétiennes 263 (Paris, 1978), 262-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that "the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis 16.19, Patrologia Graeca 33:945/6A-B; trans. Gifford, Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 7:120.&lt;/ref&gt; And Augustine's remarks about blowing on [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|images of the emperor]] suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: "Of the great crime of [[Law of majestas|lese majesty]] ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor."&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum, opus imperf. 3.199, CSEL 85/1:498 (PL 45:1333).&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as [[Bede]], we may suspect that "exsufflate" in the sense of "revile" or "cast off" may be a living metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Historia ecclesiastica, in Charles Plummer, ed., Baedae opera historica (Oxford, 1896), 1:2231 and 1:7; cp. 2:226n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==

The extremely influential ''Life of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]] seems to have set in motion a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them.&lt;ref&gt;Vita Sancti Martini, ed. Carl Halm, CSEL 1.206-7 (cp. the Old English version in [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], Lives of the Saints, ed. W. W. Skeat, EETS 76 (1890), 292-3 (II.xxxi.42)).&lt;/ref&gt; Of Saint [[Pachomius]], for example, it is said that "defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled … ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in a note to Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum, PL 103:1020C-D.&lt;/ref&gt; And of [[Saint Goswin]] that "a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ …' and … therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe …,' and immediately … the devil vanished."&lt;ref&gt;Anecdota ex codicibus hagiographicis Iohannis Gielemans canonici regularis in rubea valle prope Bruxelles, ed. Hagiographi Bollandiani (Brussels, 1895), 23 (Sanctilogium 9.2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprian and Justina|Saint Justina]] is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: "blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and … felt herself freed from all temptation."&lt;ref&gt;Th. Graese, ed., Jacobi Voragine Legenda Aurea …, 3rd ed. (Vratislaviae, 1890), cap. cxlii (p. 634; cp. 633).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Saint Felix]] is said to have destroyed [[Cult image|idols]] and uprooted [[sacred tree]]s by like means.&lt;ref&gt;Graesse, ed., Legenda Aurea, cap. cxxvi (p.575) and cap. xix (102-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. [[Gregory of Nyssa]] says of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]] ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to "no finicking  and laborious" magic, but "there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth."&lt;ref&gt;PG 46:943/4A.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Plummer, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford, 1910), 1:clxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the ''Estoire del saint graal'' as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's ''Life of [[Saint Guthlac]]'' relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he "washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Colgrave, ed. and trans., Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac (Cambridge, 1956), 130/31.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to [[Bede]], on behalf of [[Herebald]], is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, Historia ecclesiastica 5.6 (Plummer, 291; see also B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Myonrs, Bede's Ecclesastical History (Oxford, 1969), 468 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic and folk medicine==

[[Tertullian]] remarked to his wife about Christian practices: "will you not seem to be doing magic?" in the eyes of a non-believer.&lt;ref&gt;Ad uxorem II.v.3 (ed. Munier, 138). For additional references to blowing in ancient magic, see Waszink's and Van Winden's notes to Tertullian's De idolatria, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celsus]] (according to [[Origen]]) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 1.68, ed. Marcel Borret, Origène: "Contre Celse," 1, Sources Chrétiennes 132 (Paris, 1967), 266 (PG 11:787/788A).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] seems to attack its use by Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, Enneads, II.ix.14, ed. and trans. [[A. H. Armstrong]], Loeb Classical Library, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 278/9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Lucian]]'s tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest-control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Macleod, ed., Luciani opera, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1974), 182; trans. in "The Liar," The Works of Lucian of Samosata, trans. H. W. and F. G. Fowler, vol. 3 (Oxford, 1905), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of [[the holy Bible]], in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John, KJV text, John 9:1-9:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
. However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. [[Ephraem Syrus]] advises that "if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Döger, Exorzismus, 125n.&lt;/ref&gt;

If it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means.&lt;ref&gt;Dölger, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drechsler, "Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Drechsler, Sitte, Brauch, und Volksglaube im Schlesien, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1906), 280. Cp. 298 and chapter 14, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies,&lt;ref&gt;See HddA, i, ''s.v.'' "Blasen," cols. 1357-58. See also from the Puckett collections nos. 6943, 8329, and 8401 (alleviation of a burn); 2750, 2889, 2890, 10566, and 2898 (thrush and sore mouth); and 9277 and 9279 (erysipelas): Popular Beliefs and Superstitions: A Compendium of American Folklore from the...Collection of Newbell Niles Puckett, ed. Wayland D. Hand, Anna Casetta, and Sondra B. Thiederman, 3 vols. (Boston, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; for example the Shetland cure that requires blowing on a burn three times while reciting the charm "Here come I to cure a burnt sore. / If the dead knew what the living endure, / The burnt sore would burn no more."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. F. Thiselton-Dyer]], ''English Folklore'', 2nd rev. ed. (London, 1880), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing.&lt;ref&gt;HddA, ''loc. cit.''; cp. also the Puckett collection, nos. 23714, 23956, 23957, 9215, 25571, 19545, 9563, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Wolters cites Drechsler 2:15, a passage that describes how to avert the bad luck of biting into a piece of bread already bitten.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye. Some still&lt;br/&gt;blow three times over a strange spoon before using it, and in Alaska the medicine&lt;br/&gt;man blows into the nose and mouth of a patient to drive out the daemon of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier F. M. G. Wolters, Notes on Antique Folklore on the basis of Pliny's "Natural History" Bk. XXVIII.22-29 (Amsterdam, 1935), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Finally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Puckett Collection, no. 3294 (reported from Cleveland, Ohio, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Jealousy}}

[[File:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Love Letter from a Rival'''&lt;br&gt; A youth catches her boyfriend with a love letter from another.&lt;br&gt;

'''Jealousy in art''' deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works.

Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss, real or imagined, of something or someone you believe is yours, whereas envy concerns what you don’t have and would like to possess. Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona: Iago is consumed with envy of Othello’s prestige. Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy, and because the emotion is so corrosive, jealousy is a common theme in literature and art, not to mention opera and cinema.

==Literature==
Literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications. Most famously, perhaps, Schahriar's destructive jealousy in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is what precipitates Scheherazade’s creative outpouring of stories. In [[Ariosto]]’s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness. [[Shakespeare]]'s later play, ''the Winters tale'' (1613) is predominately about the jealousy felt by Leontes' and his supposed adulterous wife. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]’s Princess Brambilla (1821) is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater, between reality and masks. In [[Charlotte Brontë]]’s ''Villette'' (1853) jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations, a potent denial of sexual stereotypes, and, like many novels written by women, an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover. [[Anthony Trollope]] uses both ''He Knew He Was Right'' (1869) and ''Kept in the Dark'' (1882) to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body. [[Tolstoy]]’s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'' (1889) offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed [[homosexuality]]. [[Proust]]’s ''In Search of Lost Time'' (1913–1927), especially the section concerning Albertine, represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment, illness and death, while [[Michal Choromanski]]’s ''Jealousy and Medicine'' (1932) creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy. [[Freud]]’s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires [[Iris Murdoch]]’s ''A Word Child'' (1975) in which the [[London]] subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same.

Other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader, as well as that between fiction and reality. [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]’s ''Jealousy'' (1965) develops the image of the window blind (in [[French language|French]] “la jalousie” means both the emotion and the window blind) to lock the reader into the jealous person’s mind, while in [[Julian Barnes]]’s ''Talking it Over'' (1991), the writer’s jealousy of the reader’s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines. [[A. S. Byatt]]’s ''Possession'' (1990) is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices.

==Graphic arts==
[[File:On the Beach -- Two Are Company, Three Are None.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Two are Company, Three Are None'', 1872, a [[wood engraving]] by [[Winslow Homer]]]]
In art, depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise: see for instance drawings by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690) or [[Sébastien Leclerc (1676-1763)|Sébastien Leclerc]] (the Younger) (1676–1763), or in a fuller treatment, the howling figure on the left in [[Bronzino]]’s ''An Allegory with Venus and Cupid'' (probably 1540-50). [[Albrecht Dürer]]’s 1498 drawing, ''Hercules’s Jealousy'' depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword. The theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]’s ''Paolo and Francesca'' (1819) which reveals the jealous husband’s gaze catching the young lovers’ first kiss. [[Edvard Munch]]’s many depictions of jealousy, however, tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze. This suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors. There are, nevertheless, lighter moments, as when [[Gaston de La Touche]] (1854–1913), in ''Jealousy or the Monkey'' shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman’s dress. While popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid, it remains a source, both in literature and in painting, of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself.

'''Ludlow Street''' runs between [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston]] and [[Division Street (Manhattan)|Division]] Streets on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. Vehicular traffic runs south on this [[one-way street]].

==Name==
Ludlow Street was named after Lieutenant [[Augustus Ludlow]], the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain [[James Lawrence]] on the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] during the ship’s engagement with [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] on June 1, 1813.  It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said "Don't give up the ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate,&lt;ref name=gotham476&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.476&lt;/ref&gt; which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, pp.267-68&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, [[Forsyth Street|Forsyth]] and [[Chrystie Street|Chrystie]] Streets.&lt;ref name=gotham476 /&gt; At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of ''[[Kleindeutschland]]'', where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand]], [[Stanton Street|Stanton]], and Pitt Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.745&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and music scene===
As far back as 1962 ''[[Theatre of Eternal Music]]'' members [[Tony Conrad]] and [[Angus MacLise]] lived and worked at 56 Ludlow&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watson, ''Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties'', Pantheon, New York, 2003, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1965 [[Lou Reed]], [[John Cale]] and [[Sterling Morrison]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]'' was recorded there.&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, David, liner notes for the ''Peel Slowly and See'' box set (Polydor, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included [[Warhol superstars]] [[Mario Montez]] and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323596204578241620759540276 "Incubator for the Velvet Underground"], ''Wall Street Journal'' (January 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] tape archives subtitled  ''56 Ludlow Street'' that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack Smith - Les Evening Gowns Damnees - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964, Volume I''  and  ''Jack Smith - Silent Shadows On Cinemaroc Island - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964 Volume II''. Label: Table of the Elements. CDs released in 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of [[Taylor Mead]] talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called ''Taylor Mead's Cat''.  From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead's.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Dan [http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm "Taylor Mead, Superstar:The Life and Times of a Downtown Legend"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120914024636/http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm |date=2012-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An excerpt from Tyler Hubby's film ''Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present'' documents Tony Conrad making a [[field recording]] on Ludlow Street.

In the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where [[no wave]] [[Colab]] artists connected with [[ABC No Rio]] lived; such as [[Kiki Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], "The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984", [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fab Five Freddy]], [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]], [[Tom Otterness]], Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, Izhar Patkin, Tron Von Hollywood, [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Raina Jane Sherry, Christof Kohlhofer, [[Carlo McCormick]], Cara Perlman, [[Steven Parrino]], Edwige Belmore, [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Uli Rimkus, [[Peter Fend]], [[Walter Robinson (art critic and artist)|Walter Robinson]], [[Aline Mare]], Emily XYZ, and [[George Condo]]. In 1980, [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]] made a video called ''Ludlow'' about Ludlow Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orensanznyc.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/les-on-the-screen-film-series-up-coming-screening-october-3-coleen-fitzgibbon-stephanie-gray/ "'LES on the Screen' Film Series: Screening October 3, 2011: Coleen Fitzgibbon &amp; Stephanie Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the [[East Village Eye]] cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the [[Beastie Boys]] used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and [[Rivington Street]] as the cover for their album ''[[Paul's Boutique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php NYC Album Art: Paul's Boutique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415205746/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php |date=2007-04-15 }}, accessed April 26, 2007. "According to the album, Paul's Boutique is in [[Brooklyn]]...but we all know this photo was taken in the [[Lower East Side]]. With a Paul's Boutique sign hanging up on the Lee's Sportswear storefront, the shot was taken at 99 Rivington Street, where Rivington and Ludlow intersect."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the two level loft at 58 Ludlow was the home to artists such as Alex Hahn, Douglas Eisenstark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://Douglaseisenstark.com Douglas Eisenstark]&lt;/ref&gt; David Blair and Leslie Mentel, among others. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at [[Postmasters Gallery]] in 2016/2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2017/02/film/Wolfgang-Staehle-Ludlow-Street Keith Sanborn art review of Wolfgang Staehle at The Brooklyn Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentrification===
In the mid- to late 1990s, the increasing popularity of the area among [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], driven out of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] by an invasion of [[yuppie]]s, led to an upturn in activity along Ludlow Street, with several old establishments, such as corner delis (a.k.a. [[convenience store|bodegas)]] closing shop to make way for [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[music venue]]s such as the Ludlow Street Bar &amp; Grill (a basement restaurant and music venue), and [[Theatre|alternative theatres]] such as [[Collective: Unconscious|Collective:Unconscious Theater]] (before it became an empty lot), [[Piano's|Piano's Theater]] (before it became a music venue and bar), and Todo Con Nada (before it became The Dark Room).

In the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as [[Cake Shop NYC|Cake Shop]], [[The Living Room]], and [[Piano's]] making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, [[Katz's Deli]] (one of the city's most famous [[delicatessen]]s) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as "The Hat." The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the [[Goethe-Institut]] New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and [[Liam Gillick]]. In 2005 artist [[Wolfgang Staehle]] created ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)''. The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutiondelart.net/edla/artists/w_staehle.html ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire &amp; Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/2013/02/21/pink-pony-had-a-great-ride-but-couldnt-buck-changes/ The Villager: Pink Pony had a great ride, but couldn’t buck changes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Banksy]] installed a major [[street art]] installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his ''[[Better Out Than In]]'' residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens googles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/87431/banksy-watch-new-work-in-les-red-hook-work-protected/ "Banksy Watch: New Work in LES"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15520">'''Maternal death in fiction''' is a common theme encountered in literature, movies, and other media.

The death of a mother during [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]] or [[Postnatal|puerperium]] is a tragic event. The chances of a child surviving such an extreme birth are compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://apha.confex.com/apha/131am/techprogram/paper_62489.htm | author=Uhler SA | title=Impact of a mother’s death on child health and survival in Haiti | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fictional literature the death of a pregnant or delivering mother is a powerful device: it removes one character and places the surviving child into an often hostile environment which has to be overcome.

Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother... were all equally against her... Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on."

'''''Mirth &amp; Girth''''' is a portrait painting by [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) student David K. Nelson, Jr., depicting the recently deceased, popular African-American mayor of [[Chicago]], [[Harold Washington]] wearing only a bra, [[G-string]], garter belt and stockings.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD4093DE240&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Controversial painting reported damaged |author1=Hanania, Mark  |author2=Padgett, Tim  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 14, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief showing at a May 11, 1988 private student exhibition in the Art Institute, angry African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]], including Ald. [[Allan Streeter]],  Ald. [[Bobby Rush]] and Ald. [[Dorothy Tillman]],  arrived with [[Chicago Police Department]] officers and confiscated the painting, triggering a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and race relations crisis and a civil lawsuit.

[[Freedom of speech|Free-speech]] advocates condemned the seizure of the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington and should have been taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the [[Richard J. Daley Plaza]], while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.

At some point between when the painting was confiscated and when it was returned, a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|adj=on}} gash was made on the canvas. Nelson filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. He and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) settled with the city for $95,000 (1994; {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in compensation for the damaged painting after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|lower court's]] decision.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Harold Washington, the subject of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]]. After the death of [[Richard J. Daley]] in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, prevailing over [[Bernard Epton]] in a racially polarizing general election.&lt;ref name=levinsohn&gt;{{cite book |title=Harold Washington: A Political Biography |last=Hamlish Levinsohn |first=Florence |year=1983 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |pages=265–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first four-year term was characterized by the [[Council Wars]], a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in [[Chicago City Council|City Council]].&lt;ref name="rivlin_209-210"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly of a heart attack in his office.&lt;ref name="merriner_19871206"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36D9B94393A81&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=City's 'Beirut' image fires up outside press on mayor vote |last=Merriner |first=Jim |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 6, 1987 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis_19871126"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF68F31FB93F51A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Mayor's death stuns city&amp;nbsp;— black leader, 65, on verge of a dream |author=Davis, Robert.

=== Creation of painting ===
Shortly after Washington's death, Nelson (who is white)&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6153EF930A25756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |title=Chicago aldermen and police seize portrait that blacks deem offensive |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |author=Schmidt, William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'', a "full-length frontal portrait of a portly grim-faced Harold Washington clad in a white bra and G-string, garter belt, and stockings".&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt; The painting was approximately {{convert|4|ft|cm|0}} tall by {{convert|3|ft|cm|0}} wide.&lt;ref name="brenson_19880529"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1F38F93AA15756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A savage painting raises troubling questions |author=Brenson, Michael |date=May 29, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the portrait, Washington is holding a pencil in his right hand. His aide, Alton Miller, initially mistook Washington's slumping over his desk as an attempt to pick up a pencil that had fallen onto the floor.&lt;ref name="dubin_29"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 29 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivlin_403"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis_19880513_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBFF29B67B3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art School in Political Crossfire |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Davis, Robert |accessdate=2008-04-22 |date=May 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece is presumably derived from [[Girth &amp; Mirth]], an organization for [[Chub (gay culture)|overweight gay men]].&lt;ref name="dubin_32"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 32 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Nelson stated that he had painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' over the course of one night, standing in his underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned [[Jesus Christ]], looking down on the Chicago skyline.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD3D90C4278&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute surrenders&amp;nbsp;— Will bar controversial painting of Washington |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=January 27, 1988 |author1=Hanania, Ray  |author2=Cronin, Barry  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D9163AF934A25751C0A96F948260 |title=The Editorial Notebook; Chicago Seeks a Winning Coalition |author=Wycliff, Don |work=The New York Times |date=February 17, 1989 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.projectposner.org/case/1994/16F3d145 Nelson v.

The caricature was not Nelson's first. He had drawn a portrait of his mother as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' for Mother's Day. Nelson had also drawn a caricature of his father as the model depicted on boxes of [[Cream of Wheat]].  Nelson explained, "(t)his kind of irreverence and iconoclasm runs through all my artwork". In an April Fools' Day edition of a ''[[Weekly World News]]'' parody produced by Nelson, he illustrated SAIC president Edward Jones as an infant in the arms of a bare-breasted [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DF07B02FACEB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schlesinger, Toni |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 22, 1998 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |title=The mayoral painter's 15 minutes of fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display and confiscation ==

=== Initial display ===
On May 11, 1988, ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' was displayed at a private exhibition in one of the school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled "I'm Sensitive, and I Love All Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone calls about the painting.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Soon after the exhibit opened, word of the controversy reached the [[Chicago City Council]], which was in session. Alderman [[Bobby Rush]] (then of the 2nd ward)&lt;ref name="siewers_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD390636B54&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author1=Siewers, Alf  |author2=Hanania, Ray  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |title=Controversial painting leads to brush with law}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately put together a resolution that would cut off the city's contribution to the Art Institute unless it apologized for displaying the painting. In part, the resolution read "Whereas, the artist David Nelson obviously exhibits some type of demented and pathological mental capacities&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Another resolution was written that asked the Art Institute to remove the painting immediately. After passing both items, a group of aldermen left to deliver the resolutions to the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Nelson returned to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning against the wall for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt;

=== Confiscation ===
Aldermen [[Edward Jones (Illinois politician)|Edward Jones]] (20th) and [[William C. Henry]] (24th) were the first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung painting from the wall and placed it on the floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, [[Allan Streeter]] (17th), [[Dorothy Tillman]] (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting to the office of the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} gash,&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514" /&gt; and it had been wrapped in brown paper.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Alderman Tillman threatened to burn the painting in President Jones' office, but a [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) lieutenant present with the aldermen, Lt. Raymond Patterson, advised against this. Instead, another unnamed alderman called CPD [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Leroy Martin. Martin telephoned Patterson in Jones' office and ordered Patterson to take the painting into police custody, telling Jones that the painting amounted to "incitement to riot".

The incident was marked by a volatile shouting match between the aldermen and students, and met with condemnation from free-speech advocates. As the aldermen escorted the painting to the police vehicle, a mass of students outside of the Art Institute jeered them, naming the aldermen "commies", "fascists", "[[brownshirt]]s" and "[[Philistinism|philistines]]".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; Seventeen bomb threats were recorded at the school after the controversy erupted.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;

== Responses ==

=== African-American community ===
Shortly after the incident, a black alderman told reporters that he believed the painting was the work of a Jewish artist. Nelson replied through a ''Chicago Tribune'' story that he "is not Jewish".&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; The remark was made in part because racial tensions had already been elevated a week earlier after the firing of [[Steve Cokely]], a mayoral aide, by African-American mayor and Harold Washington's successor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. Cokely had accused Jews of "engaging in an international conspiracy for world control". His firing caused a rift in segments of the black community, leading some to believe that Sawyer was also involved in the same conspiracy.&lt;ref name="lipinski_19880506"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE8B553106E6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sawyer fires Cokeley as aide&amp;nbsp;— somber mayor asks city to look beyond controversy |date=May 6, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=[[Ann Marie Lipinski]] and Baquet, Dean.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article published on May 13, 1988, Alderman Streeter reiterated his stance regarding the removal of the painting, saying that he would have "gone to jail to get that painting down", calling it "an insult to a great man and an affront to blacks".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"/&gt; On May 16, 1988, Streeter appeared on [[WTTW|the local public television station]] news program ''[[Chicago Tonight]]''.

On May 12, 1988, representatives from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) picked up the painting and returned it to Nelson. Jay Miller, another representative for the ACLU, described the incident as "vigilante stuff", noting that the action "was done in the name of one of the great civil libertarians of our time. Harold Washington had a 100&amp;nbsp;percent voting record in Congress and in the state Legislature on issues of civil liberties and civil rights."&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; In 1984 Washington had supported the civil rights of sculptor John Sefick after Sefick had created a satirical statue of Washington.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; By comparison, former mayor [[Michael Bilandic]] had ordered a Sefick statue satirizing his handling of Chicago's crippling [[Chicago Blizzard of 1979|Blizzard of 1979]] covered by a blanket, a decision that was later overturned in federal court.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880502"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE6EE0F3AE64&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sculptor carves governor's likeness with a barb |author=Kendall, Peter |date=May 2, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the SAIC protested on [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]] the next day, holding signs that asked drivers to "honk for free speech". Student leaders began to consult attorneys to file a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. Other groups of students planned a "[[Human Be-In|be-in]]" at the [[Richard J.

On ''Chicago Tonight'', Daniel Polsby, a law professor at [[Northwestern University]], cited federal statutes violated during the confiscation of the portrait. He then faulted Marshall Field's reluctance to defend the First Amendment, further comparing the seizure of ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' to then-Arkansas governor [[Orval Faubus]]' refusal to abide by the First Amendment and allow minorities to enroll in [[Little Rock Central High School]]. According to Polsby, Faubus' rationale at the time was to preserve a delicate civil rights situation. Polsby called the aldermen's action "crushingly ironic and terribly sad".&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Reactions within the SAIC ===
At the SAIC, students' characterizations of the painting ranged from political caricature, to "whimsy", to a commercial success. One student noted that Nelson was "known nationally now, which is every artist's dream". Another student noted that "(a)rtists have to be responsible for what they make, and this guy is not being responsible". In a meeting with 100&amp;nbsp;students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights. Regarding the painting, Jones said that the painting was in poor taste and should not have been displayed.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

Members of the Art Institute Board met the day after the incident and agreed not to display ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
Members of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, which included leaders from mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations from the city, issued a statement that expressed "moral dismay" over the painting. They further added that the display of the painting showed "a lack of sensitivity which we could have expected from those who were responsible for its showing".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513" /&gt;

As for the painting's critical reception, one local art reviewer mentioned that "the only thing [the SAIC] might have felt sheepish about was not having a staff that in four years could instill in Nelson a better grasp of figure painting".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting."&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; In his book ''Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions'', Stephen C.

Nelson gave only a few interviews before leaving Chicago for the suburbs, and then [[Graceland]] to avoid the press.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; On the advice of his friends, Nelson stayed away from his graduation ceremony on May 14, 1988.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515" /&gt; He turned down a $15,000 (1988, $22,000 in 2008) offer for the painting, calling it a "grossly inflated" price. He also turned down a separate opportunity to appear on [[Phil Donahue]]'s syndicated talk show, saying that he never watched the show and was genuinely uninterested in the offer.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Other than the interview with WLUP, Nelson's views were expressed by Harvey Grossman, the legal director for the ACLU. Through Grossman, Nelson said he would not press for the returning of the painting, as it had fulfilled its purpose of "drawing attention to his '[[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]' work".&lt;ref name="davis_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBF1E8DADB6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Politics takes its place in the world of art |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Davis, Robert and [[Ann Marie Lipinski]].

== ''Nelson v. Streeter'' ==
On June 23, 1988, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Nelson against the three aldermen who were seen on television handling the painting.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE207421D41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Pitt, Leon |date=June 24, 1988 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |title=Suit hits seizure of Washington painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed the removal of the painting violated Nelson's First Amendment right to freedom of expression, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] right to protection from unreasonable seizures, and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]] right against being deprived of property without a hearing. The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, {{Inflation|US|100000|1988|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to "punish" the aldermen and police for their actions.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

Ald. Robert Shaw (9th) called the suit "a slap in the face to the black community". Rush questioned the motive of the suit, as himself, Tillman and Streeter all were supporters of Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] (17th), a political rival of mayor Eugene Sawyer. Rush specifically called the suit "frivolous" and "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

The City of Chicago refused in February 1990 to pay mounting legal costs for the aldermen. The aldermen argued that they were performing their official duties "in protecting the security of the city during the turmoil created by the exhibit" when they removed the painting. The city contended that the aldermen had taken the action as individuals.&lt;ref name="strong_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF82825B81D1A52&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen ask city: Pay our art flap costs |author=Strong, James |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson refused a $10,000 (1990, {{Inflation|US|10000|1990|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) settlement at the time.&lt;ref name="hanania_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB372CC0FC12A41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen sued in art tiff want city to pay lawyer |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author=Hanania, Ray |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, U.S. District Judge George Lindberg dismissed the City of Chicago from the lawsuit, but ruled that Superintendent Martin must go to trial and that the three aldermen violated Nelson's civil rights. Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate Judge]] Elaine Bucklo's had made in March&amp;nbsp;1992. Tillman's lawyer, James Chapman, recommended to Tillman that an immediate appeal be filed in federal court.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19920811"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFEE336AB06BEAD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Judge rules for artist in '88 case |date=August 11, 1992 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |author=O'Connor, Matt.

=== Appellate court ===
In the appeal, decided February 1, 1994, judges [[Richard Posner]], [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], and [[Michael Stephen Kanne]] affirmed Lindberg's earlier decision. Writing for the court, Posner rejected claims of official immunity and said city officials had no right to enter private property and take "offensive" paintings off its walls.&lt;ref name="ncac"&gt;[http://www.ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm Nelson v. Streeter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515225219/http://ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm |date=2008-05-15 }}, [[Case citation#Lower federal courts|16 F.3d 145]] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the argument that removing paintings from walls was an official duty.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;

Posner also rejected the argument that the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, and that there was no mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

The appellate court also faulted the district judge for allowing "more than a year and a half elapsed before the filing and disposition of the motions for summary judgment". Posner noted in his opinion that "the governing principles are clear, the facts have been explored exhaustively, and the defendants should be aware that efforts to mount a last-ditch, no-holds-barred defense may simply increase their liability for the plaintiff's attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988." He then affirmed the district court's decision.&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23608">The '''Neo-Concrete Movement''' (1959–61) was a Brazilian art movement, which developed from [[Rio de Janeiro]]’s [[Grupo Frente]], a coalition of artists working in [[Concrete Art]]. Neoconcrete artists rejected the pure rationalist approach of concrete art and embraced a more phenomenological and less scientific art. [[Ferreira Gullar]] inspired Neo-Concrete philosophy through his essay “Theory of the Non-Object” (1959) and wrote the “Neo-Concrete Manifesto” (1959) which outlines what Neo-Concrete art should be. [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]], and [[Lygia Pape]] were among the primary leaders of this movement.

== Background ==
After [[World War One]], Europe witnessed a boom of art movements based upon rationalism such as [[De Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]]. Artists believed humanity would be able to achieve progress through its ability to reason. In Latin America, ideas of rationalist and non-objective art took root in the early 1950s in reaction to the muralism controversy.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Latin American Art of the 20th Century|date=2004|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20356-9|pages=121, 137|oclc=57007345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments such as the Mexican government utilized muralists to create propaganda. Under repressive Latin American governments, artists rebelled against the idea of aiding the political regime through figurative art; therefore geometric abstraction and concretism ushered in an art that did not connote anything political or have really any meaning at all.

[[Concrete Art]] was able to flourish beneath these repressive regimes because it held no political messages or incendiary material.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; In Brazil, ideas of rationalist art and geometric abstraction arose in the early 1950s following the establishment of a democratic republic in 1946.  The period from 1946 to 1964 is known as the [[Second Brazilian Republic]].&lt;ref name ="Flynn"&gt;Flynn, Peter. Flynn, Peter. ''Nations of the Modern World, Brazil: A Political Analysis''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as Grupo Ruptura in [[Sao Paulo]] and Grupo Frente in Rio de Janeiro rose. Specifically Ruptura followed the ideal of pure [[mathematical art]] which does not connote meaning outside of what it is.&lt;ref name ="Balderston"&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures''. Ed. Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez, and Ana M. Lopez. London: Routledge, 2002. 1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Concrete art movement arose when Grupo Frente realized that Concretism was “naïve and somewhat colonialist” and an “overly rational conception of abstract structure.”&lt;ref name ="Brett"&gt;Brett, Guy. "Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica." ''Latin American Artists of the Nineteenth Century.'' New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1993. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 as the political tides began to turn, the Neo-Concrete artists disbanded no longer content to limit themselves to this one philosophy. [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Hélio Oiticica]], leaders of the Neo-Concrete movement, put their energy into Conceptual Art. Art historians often refer to Neo-Concretism as the precursor to Conceptual Art because of the foundation of “abstruse metaphysics.”&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; On April 1, 1964, a military coup removed [[Joao Goulart]] and established a military government in Brazil until 1985.&lt;ref name="Flynn"/&gt; The increase of violence called for a new kind of art that had the potential to carry meaning and deconstruct traditional thought even further. This came in the form of [[Conceptual Art]].

== The Neo-Concrete Manifesto and the push against Concretism ==
Brazilian poet and writer [[Ferreira Gullar]] wrote the Neo-Concrete Manifesto in 1959 and described a work of art as “something which amounts to more than the sum of its constituent elements; something which analysis may break down into various elements but which can only be understood phenomenologically.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"&gt;Gullar, Ferreira. “Neo-Concrete Manifesto.” ''History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader.'' Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Concrete Art movement, Gullar was calling for an art that was not based upon rationalism or in pursuit of pure form. He sought works of art that became active once the viewer was involved. Neo-concrete art must disassemble the limitations of the object and “express complex human realities.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"/&gt;

While Concretism built its art upon the basis of logic and objective knowledge with color, space, and form conveying universalism and objectivity, the Neo-Concrete artists saw colors, space, and form as “not [belonging] to this or that artistic language, but to the living and indeterminate experience of man.”&lt;ref name ="Amor"&gt;Amor, Monica. “From Work to Frame, In Between, and Beyond: Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, 1959–1964.” ''Grey Room'' 38 (Winter 2010): 20-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neo-Concrete Art still maintained Concretism as the foundation for their ideas, Neo-Concretists believed objectivity and mathematical principles alone could not accomplish the Concretist goal of creating a transcendental visual language.

Neo-Concretists believed that artworks were not simply static representations or forms; rather “art should be like living organisms” &lt;ref name ="Brett"/&gt; In Lygia Clark’s theoretical statement written to address the intentions of the Neo-Concrete artists, she explains that as artists they wish to “found a new, expressive ‘space’.”&lt;ref name ="Bois"&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. “Nostalgia of the Body.” ''The MIT Press 69'' (Summer 1994): 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement believed that through a direct relationship between the artwork and the viewer this “new, expressive ‘space’” could be constructed.&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt; Neo-Concrete artists sought to create a multi-sensorial space which caused the spectator to feel more acutely their own body and existence.

Clark also wrote of how Neo-Concretism sought to decipher the nature of humanity by creating a “medium of expression” which allowed people to “become aware of unity as an organic, living whole.”&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark, Lygia. “1960: Death of the Plane.” ‘’October’’ 69 (Summer 1994): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not just restoring an awareness of the spectator’s body but also of humanity’s communal existence.

The first Neo-Concrete Exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro in March 1959, and the exhibiting artists were [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo_Jardim]], and [[Theon Spanudis]].&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt;

== ''Neo-Concrete Manifesto'' ==
This manifesto was written by [[Ferreira Gullar]], and was signed by [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo Jardim]] and [[Theon Spanudis]]. It was published on 22 of March 1959 in ''Journal do Brazil.''

We use the term “neo-concrete” to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative “[[geometric art|geometric]]” art ([[neo-plasticism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm School]]) and in particular the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously extreme rationalism. Compelled by their experiences, the painters, sculptors, engravers, and writers participating in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to revise the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains.

Born with [[cubism]], as a reaction against the impressionist disintegration of poetic language, it was natural that so-called geometric art should situate itself in a position diametrically opposed to the technical and allusive resources of ordinary painting. The new achievements of physics and mechanics, in opening up a wide perspective for objective thought, encouraged, among those who continued this revolution, the tendency towards an everincreasing rationalization of the processes and purposes of painting. A mechanicalist notion of construction invaded the language of painters and sculptors, generating, in turn, equally extreme responses of a reactionary nature, such as [[magic realism|magical]] or irrationalist [[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Dada art|Dada]], or [[surrealism]]. Therefore, there is no doubt that the true artists—as is the case with, for example, [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]]—constructed their works following those theories that consecrated [[scientific objectivity]] and mechanical precision, but in that hand-to-hand combat with expression they overcame the limits imposed by theory. Yet the work of those artists has been interpreted to this day from theoretical positions that that same work denied. We propose a reinterpretation of neo-plasticism, constructivism, and other similar movements, basing ourselves on their expressive successes and making the work of art take precedence over theory. If we were to attempt to understand Mondrian’s painting starting from his theories, we would be forced to choose one over the other. We either find the prophecy of the complete integration of art in daily life to be possible (and we see in Mondrian’s work the first steps in that direction), or we view that integration as ever more remote, in which case his work seems to have failed. Either the vertical and the horizontal are truly the fundamental rhythms of the universe, and Mondrian’s oeuvre is the application of that universal principle, or the principle fails, and his work turns out to be based on an illusion. But the truth is that Mondrian’s work is there, alive and fertile, above these theoretical contradictions. It is useless to view Mondrian as the destroyer of the surface, of the plane and the line, if we do not perceive the new space that that destruction constructed.

The same can be said of [[Georges Vantongerloo|Vantongerloo]] or Pevsner. It does not matter what mathematical equations are at the root of a sculpture or a painting by Vantongerloo, because only in the experience of its direct perception does the work provide the “meaning” of its rhythms and colors. Whether Pevsner started from figures of descriptive geometry or not is irrelevant, when one confronts the new space that his sculptures generate and the cosmic-organic expression that, through it, its forms reveal. Determining the ways in which artistic objects and scientific instruments, or the artist’s intuition and the physicist’s and engineer’s objective thought, converged may be interesting from a cultural standpoint, but from an aesthetic standpoint, the work of art provokes interest precisely because of what it possesses that transcends these external circumstances—because of the universe of existential meanings that merge and are revealed in the work of art.

[[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], having recognized the superiority of “pure perception in art,” placed his theoretical definitions in a position that was safe from the limitations of rationalism and mechanicalism, projecting a transcendent dimension in his paintings that guarantees him a notable relevance today. But Malevich’s daring cost him dearly, in simultaneously opposing both figurative art and mechanicalist abstraction, for to this day certain rationalist theoreticians consider him a naïf who did not understand the true sense of the new plastic arts … In fact, Malevich already expressed, within “geometric” painting, his dissatisfaction, his desire to transcend the rational and the sensorial, which today is undeniably manifest.

Neo-concretism, emerging out of the need to express the complex reality of modern man with the structural language of the new plastic arts, denies the validity of the attitudes espoused by scientificism and positivism in art and reconsiders the problem of expression, incorporating the new “verbal” dimensions created by constructive, non-figurative art. Rationalism divests art of all autonomy and substitutes the untransferable qualities of the work of art with notions of scientific objectivity. Thus, the concepts of form, space, time, and structure—which in the arts are linked to an existential meaning, emotive and affective—are confused with their theoretical application by science. In fact, in the name of preconceived ideas that today’s philosophy denounces ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|M. Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ernst Cassirer|E. Cassirer]], [[Susanne Katherina Langer|S. Langer]])—and that are collapsing in every field, starting with modern biology, which has overcome Pavlovian mechanicalism—the concretist-rationalists still view man as a machine among machines and attempt to limit art to the expression of that theoretical reality.

We do not conceive of art either as a “machine” or as an “object” but as a quasi-corpus, that is, an entity whose reality is not exhausted in the external relationships
of its elements; an entity that, though analytically divisible into its parts, only gives itself up fully to a direct, phenomenological approach. We believe that the work of art overcomes the material mechanism upon which it rests, not due to some virtue lying outside this Earth: it overcomes it by transcending those mechanical relationships (which is the object of Gestalt theory) and by creating for itself a tacit signification (Merleau-Ponty) that emerges in it for the first time. If we had to search for a simile for the work of art, we could not find it, therefore, either in a machine or in objects taken objectively, but rather, as S. Langer and [[Vladimir Weidlé|V. Wleidlé]] [sic] argue, in living organisms. Furthermore, this comparison would not be sufficient to express the specific reality of the aesthetic organism.

Since the work of art is not limited to occupying a place in objective space—but rather transcends it in basing a new signification in it—the objective notions of time, space, form, structure, color, etc. are not sufficient to understand the work of art, to fully explain its “reality.” The lack of an adequate terminology for expressing a world that does not succumb to notions led art critics indiscriminately to employ words that are unfaithful to the complexity of the created work. The influence of technology and science was manifest here as well, to the degree that today, with their roles reversed, certain artists, confused by that terminology, attempt to make art starting from these objective notions in order to apply them as a creative method. Inevitably, the artists who work in this fashion only reveal a priori notions, since they are constrained by a method that already prescribes the results of their work before they begin. By avoiding intuitive creation, by reducing himself to an objective body in an objective space, with his paintings the rationalist concrete artist hardly demands, from himself and from the viewer, a stimulating and reflexive reaction. He speaks to the eye as an instrument and not to the eye as a human means of possessing the world and of giving oneself to it; he speaks to the machine-eye and not the body-eye.

Given that the work of art transcends mechanical space, the notions of cause and effect lose all validity in it, and the notions of time, space, form, and color are integrated
in such a way—since they lacked any existence, as those notions, prior to the work—that it would be impossible to speak of them as elements that can be broken down. Neo-concrete art, affirming the absolute integration of these elements, vouches for the ability of its “geometric” vocabulary to assume the expression of complex human realities, manifest in many works by Mondrian, Malevich, Pevsner, Gabo, Sofia Taeuber-Arp, etc. If even these artists at times confused the concept of mechanical form with expressive form, it is important to clarify that, in the language of art, these so-called geometric forms lose the objective character of geometry in order to become vehicles for the imagination. Gestalt theory, in that it is still a psychology based on the concept of causation, also proves insufficient in helping us understand that phenomenon that dissolves the causally definable realities of space and form and presents them as time, as the spatialization of the work. By “spatialization of the work” is meant the fact that it is continually making itself present,
it is always regaining the impulse that generated it and of which it was, in turn, the origin. And if this description remits us likewise to the first—full—experience of the real, that is because neo-concrete art seeks nothing more than to revive that experience. Neo-concrete art creates a new expressive space.

This position is equally valid for neo-concrete poetry, which condemns in concrete poetry the same mechanicalist objectivism of painting. The rationalist concrete poets also established the imitation of the machine as an ideal for their art. For them, too, space and time are but external relationships between object-words. Now, if that is the case, the page is reduced to a graphic space and the word to an element of that space. As in painting, the visual here is reduced to the optical, and the poem does not transcend the graphic dimension. Neo-concrete poetry rejects such spurious notions and, faithful to the very nature of language, reaffirms the poem as a temporal entity. In time and space, the word unfolds its complex signifying nature. The page in neo-concrete poetry is the spatialization of verbal time: it is pause, silence, time. It is evidently not a matter of returning to the concept of time that characterizes discursive poetry; for while language flows in succession in discursive poetry, in concrete poetry language opens up in duration. Therefore, unlike rationalist concretism, which views the word as object and transforms it into a mere optical signal, neo-concrete poetry restores it to its condition as “verbum,” that is, to the human mode of presentation of the real. In neo-concrete poetry, language does not slip away, but rather remains.

In its turn, neo-concrete prose, opening up a new field for expressive experiments, recovers language as flux, overcoming its syntactical contingencies and giving new, fuller meaning to certain solutions that until now were erroneously accepted as poetry. This is how, in painting as in poetry, in prose as in sculpture and printmaking, neo-concrete art reaffirms the independence of artistic creation in the face of objective knowledge (science) and practical knowledge (ethics, politics, industry, etc.).

The participants in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition do not constitute a “group.” They are not united by dogmatic principles. The evident affinity of their explorations in various fields has brought them together and led them to meet here. The commitment that obliges them commits each one of them, first and foremost, to their individual experience; they will remain together as long as the deep affinity that brought them together endures.

'''Nuagisme''' (literally "cloudism") is a French [[art-critical]] term that was advanced in the 1950s by art critic [[Julien Alvard]] (1916-1974).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bauddhamata.blogspot.de/2010/09/nuagisme.html Nuagisme, Clouds / sritantra, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nut art''' was an artistic consciousness movement centered in northern California that flourished primarily in the late 60s and early 70s.

The term "Nut art" was coined by artist [[Roy De Forest]] (in conversation with writer David Zack) to describe an approach to art making which embraced humor along with the phantasmagorical. According to De Forest, Nut artists sought to create fantasy worlds reflective of their own quirks and eccentricities. As such, Nut art placed a high degree of emphasis on evolving visions, of which specific artworks were produced as part of the ongoing process of self-definition, or in service to creating new personas and personal mythologies.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=8, 24|author2=Frank, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Among these personas was that of Ralph "Doggy" Dinsmore, which was used by De Forest.)

As with [[Conceptual art]], the idea or underlying concept with Nut art was paramount. As a result, the creation of the Nut artist was not restricted by style or medium, allowing the movement to embrace emerging formats such as performance, text pieces, and appropriation, in addition to more traditional two and three dimensional mediums such as drawing, photography, and sculpture. Because of the emphasis on concept and satire, Nut art welcomed contributions from participants without formal artistic backgrounds as well as those with advanced technical skill and training. Nut art also reflected the importance of process over product, which had been a central tenet of the Action painters a generation previous.

Besides De Forest, other key practitioners of Nut art included [[Robert Arneson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fineberg|first=Jonathan|title=A troublesome subject : the art of Robert Arneson|year=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-27383-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clayton Bailey]] (as well as Bailey's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Thomas|title=Art in the San Francisco Bay area, 1945-1980 : an illustrated history|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-520-05193-9|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victor Cicansky (alter-ego Victor Ceramski), Robert Cumming, [[Lowell Darling]], Jack Ford, [[David Gilhooly]], Jerry Gooch, Linda Renner, [[Peter Saul]], Harold Schlotzhauer, Richard Shaw, Irv Tepper, Chris Unterseher, Peter VandenBerge, Franklin Williams, Maija Zack (alter-ego Maija Woof), and David Zack.&lt;ref name=DePaoli /&gt;

David Zack, who was also a poet and art critic, reviewed many of the group's exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Daniels /&gt; Zack also participated in the movement as an exhibiting artist.

The first major exhibition of Nut art took place in 1972 at the University Art Gallery of [[California State University, Hayward]]. The show was co-curated by Clayton Bailey  (then art faculty) and Gallery Director Irene Keil.&lt;ref name=DePaoli&gt;{{cite book|last=DePaoli |first=G.

'''''October''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] specializing in [[contemporary art]], [[art criticism|criticism]], and [[critical theory|theory]], published by [[MIT Press]].

==History==
''October'' was established in 1976 in New York by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Annette Michelson]], who left ''[[Artforum]]'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/arts/design/25benglis.html?_r=0 | title=Art or Ad or What?

The journal was a participant in introducing French [[Post-structuralism|post-structural theory]] on the English-speaking academic scene.&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cusste2009"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = U of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4732-3| last = Cusset| first = François| title = French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co.

In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], Denis Hollier, and [[John Rajchman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trikster.net/2/crimp/1.html |title=Mathias Danbolt, Front Room – Back Room: An Interview with Douglas Crimp |work=Trikster – Nordic Queer Journal #2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-26|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
As well as in-depth articles and reviews of 20th century and contemporary art, the journal features critical interpretations of cinema and popular culture from a progressive viewpoint.

==Impact==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the journal was an "influential vehicle for the debate surrounding the emergence of postmodernism and New Historicism in 20th-century art-historical studies", and the journal "contributed greatly to Anglo-American academics’ adoption of French theoretical innovations, especially those pertaining to the analysis of cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosalind-E-Krauss#ref1041327 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |work=Rosalind E.

'''Photorealism''' is a genre of art that encompasses [[painting]], [[drawing]] and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a [[photograph]] and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another [[Medium (arts)|medium]]. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"&gt;Lindey (1980), pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], "The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II", ''Art In America.'' 61 (November–December 1973), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a counter to [[Abstract Expressionism]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt; as well as [[Minimal art|Minimalist art movements]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"&gt;Battock, Gregory. Preface to [[Louis K. Meisel|Meisel, Louis K.]] (1980), ''Photorealism''. New York:[[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"/&gt;  Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a [[camera]] and photographs is an acceptance of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt; However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"&gt;Scharf, Aaron (1969), ''Art and Photography'' Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations;&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"/&gt; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;  Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as [[Edward Hopper]], they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"&gt;Chase, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"&gt;Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), ''American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present''. New York:Rizzoli. {{ISBN|0847800490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"/&gt;

The association of Photorealism to ''[[Trompe L'oeil]]'' is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition. New York: [[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. p. 709. {{ISBN|0810939134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to "fool the eye" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;

===Definition===
The word ''Photorealism'' was coined by [[Louis K. Meisel]]&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"&gt;[http://www.meiselgallery.com/ Meiselgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show "Twenty-two Realists."&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"&gt;Meisel (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, [[New Realism]], Sharp Focus Realism, or [[hyperrealism (painting)|Hyper-Realism]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12" /&gt;

Louis K. Meisel,&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"/&gt; two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"/&gt;  The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#  The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
#  The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semimechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
#  The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
#  The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
#  The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the [[photograph]].  In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"/&gt;  Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto [[canvas]]es.  Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide.  This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and [[virtuoso|virtuosity]] to simulate, such as [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s in specular surfaces and the [[geometry|geometric]] rigor of man-made environs.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists===
The first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as [[John Baeder]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Charles Bell (painter)|Charles Bell]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]],  and [[Tom Blackwell]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"&gt;Meisel (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--[[landscape]]s (mostly [[cityscape|urban]] rather than naturalistic), [[portrait]]s, and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"/&gt; In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) [http://onmywall.co/photorealism-technical-mastery-and-effortless-style/ "Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style"] ''On My Wall''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John DeAndrea]] are [[sculptor]]s associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated [[hair]] and real clothes. They are called ''Verists.''&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980" /&gt;

===Since 2000===

[[File:Glennray Tutor 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dream of Love'' (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist [[Glennray Tutor]]'s work]]

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries.  According to Meisel and Chase's ''Photorealism at the Millennium'', only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ten including [[John Baeder]] and Howard Kanovitz.

Artists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists.  Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by [[Glennray Tutor]]. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph.  Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with [[Franz Gertsch]] in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and [[Roberto Bernardi]] are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisel, Millennium"/&gt; This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as [[The Prague Project]], in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as "[[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]."&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media.  The artist [[William Fink|Bill Fink]] has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Photo Realism: Artist Bill Fink uses human ash to create a visual AIDS memorial|author=Steve Greenberg|date=2 June 1992|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=604|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as [[Juxtapoz]]'s 2014 book entitled ''Hyperreal'' detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

[[File:Henri Rousseau - Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''In a Tropical Forest Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo'', 1908-1909, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E. Crow |date=May 2018 |website=www.pacermonitor.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-self-portrait-1966 |title=Self-Portrai |author=Andy Warhol |date=1966 |website=MoMALearning |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]:  a hero glimpses the end of his quest.]]
{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

[[File:Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece, Forest Women by Artist Mumbiram.jpeg|thumb|Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece "Forest Women" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

'''Rasa Renaissance''' is a movement in the art of painting that makes evocation of rasas (emotional moods) the prime aim in the creation and appreciation of a work of art. [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] is the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art produces through the personalities, their expression and the situation presented in a painting. Rasa is a [[Sanskrit]] word that denotes the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art brings about. Rasa Theory is a theory of aesthetic criticism that has been prevalent in appreciation of literary works in Sanskrit language for millenniums (see: [[Indian aesthetics|Indian aesthetic]]).

The idea of Rasa Renaissance evolved in the last quarter of the twentieth century in the domain of painting, as a countermovement to [[abstract art |abstract]] and conceptual art. Rasa Renaissance is led by artist, philosopher and Sanskrit scholar Dr. [[Mumbiram]] of India (Ph.D. Berkeley California). In the twentieth century, the art of painting progressively became dissociated from depiction of personalities in real-world situations. It concerned itself with exploration of forms and colours for their own sake. It became more or less an exercise in clever intellectual sophistication. Art of Rasa Renaissance presupposes personalities in various situations, and in various emotional states, as being central to a work of art.

== Rasa art and personalist art ==
The emotions that the creator of a painting has in mind, the emotions that personalities who appear in a painting share with each other, as also the emotions that are aroused in the viewer of a painting, are all of concern in appreciation of a work of rasa art.
As emotions are states in the minds of personalities, rasa art presupposes depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states to be the subject matter of a rasa painting. Painting that concerns itself with depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states is "personalist art". The realm of personalist art is '''personalism'''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "Encounter on the Way back from the Forest", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "Encounter on the Way back from the Forest" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== Personalist and impersonalist in history of art ==
Throughout the long history of art there has always been personalist as well as impersonal art. Portraits of kings, demigods, gods, mythological figures, saints as also ordinary people are examples of personalist art. Scenes in the lives of important as well as ordinary people are other examples. There were also battle scenes, domestic scenes, mythological and religious events. Impersonal Art existed in the form of landscapes, still-life and decorative designs. Till the late 19th century, art remained more or less representational. The beginning of the 20th century saw art indulging in deliberate distortions in depictions of personalities as well as inanimate objects. Soon afterwards, art saw itself dissociating from representation of real-world objects and personalities. Exploration of colours and forms for their own sake, without reference to any real-world entities became the subject matter of abstract paintings. Art became impersonal.

== Origins of personalist art and Rasa Renaissance ==
The idea of Rasa Renaissance first appeared in the art and writings of artist [[Mumbiram]] of India. The idea of personalist art first appears in two articles that Mumbiram wrote in 1985 in his native Marathi language in Pune's ''Ravivar Sakal''. "In Search of an Art that transcends Culture" and "The Practice of Personalist Art". In these autobiographical articles, Mumbiram describes his affectionate rapport with his artist grandfather, his success as a prodigious child artist, his giving up art to devote himself to mathematics, his years in the graduate school at Berkeley, his ''déjà vu'' with art, his search for art that does not align itself with any culture (''sanskritinirapeksha''), his falling in love with Krishna and his arrival back in India as a personalist artist.

Here Mumbiram calls his own art ''Vyaktisaapeksha Kalaa''. ''Saapekshataa'' would translate to relativity. ''Saapeksha'' would translate to 'depending on' or 'in expectation of'. ''Kalaa'' translates to Art, Art in reference to persons - Art in the context of persons. This is where the usage ''Personalist Art'' first appears.

In an article appearing in the ''Sunday Maharashtra Herald'', "Waiting in the Wings" in 1986, journalist Ashok Gopal introduces Mumbiram: "Mumbiram calls his Art Personalist Art..." The same article carries an Artist's Manifesto which makes clear reference to Personalism: "Personalism is a frontal attack on materialism on the aesthetic front", "Personalism leaves no room for the existential void".

The idea of Rasa Theory as basic to appreciation of art appears in an article about Mumbiram appearing in Mumbai's ''Sunday Observer'' in 1988 written by Sudhir Sonalkar. An interview with Mumbiram for the Mumbai tabloid ''Mid-Day'' has Mumbiram talking about Rasa Theory.

Distant Drummer Publishing has produced ''High Five of Love'', a five-volume ensemble of English translations of Sanskrit Rasa classics wherein Mumbiram's original Rasa art is juxtaposed with Rasa literature. A catalog of exhibition of Mumbiram's ''Book Readers: Love on the Gutenberg Galaxy'' cites Rasa theory of aesthetic appreciation as relevant to appreciation of Mumbiram's art. It also gives an extensive bibliography of classical works on Rasa theory. Another extensive catalog of Mumbiram's work is titled: ''Rasa Renaissance''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "I let him persuade me", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "I let him persuade me" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== ''Prema vivarta'' mood ==
According to [[Vaishnavism]] theology, Krishna is Rasaraj, the supreme source of all rasas. Depictions of incidents in Krishna's biography are most attractive subjects for Rasa art. In the ''prema vivarta'' mood of attachment to Krishna, everything in the phenomenal world appears to the lover of Krishna as a ''[[déjà vu]]'' of something related to Krishna. Many Rasa masterpieces are made in the prema vivarta mood. Ashok Gopal quotes Mumbiram: "My raven-dark rambunctious, roaming, rag-picking girlfriends remind me of Krishna and his boys in the forests of Vrindavan."

== Comparison with the Pre-Raphaelites (a paradigm shift) ==
[[Pre-Raphaelites]] were rebelling against the 'stodgy' Royal Academy. Somehow the romance was missing in the artists' lives. This group formed a secret brotherhood. Real life muses inspired their works. The inspiration was reflected in their paintings. The real lives of the artists and their works had a symbiotic relationship between them.

Rasa art, or art of Rasa Renaissance, is rebelling against the far more 'stodgy' art establishment of the twentieth century. Art degenerated into creation of 'brand equity' in logos. Depiction of persons was pigeonholed into the category of 'figurative' and 'representational' art for the less intelligent simpletons. Art museums, auction houses, art galleries and art schools all descended into a rut of vested interests. Rasa Renaissance rebels by bringing back into the purview of contemporary art the noble situations of human existence, the innate beauty of personalities and love amongst individuals. By the standards of the Rasa Theory of aesthetics, only Personalist Art can genuinely evoke rasas. So-called 'abstract' art is merely Impersonal Art, severely limited in its ability to invoke any rasa.

The Pre-Raphaelites used muses as models. They used monochrome, posed photographs of their muses/models to achieve realism. They spent considerable effort in painting carpets and folds in clothing. They strived to make paintings appear 'as good as' colour photographs.

Rasa art is inspired by real-life muses. They are not professional models. They are from an entirely different milieu. The artist meets them through personal encounter of the [[Romanticism|romantic type]]. Living in an era when color photography and photoshop are commonplace, rasa art is predominantly charcoal renderings. They are effortless quick live renderings. They don't aspire for photorealism. The person is of prime importance. The surroundings are not even depicted. The drama of the meeting and also the rendering is the 'high' the artist and the muses share. The admirers meet the artist in equally surprising ways. They are thrilled to be caught in the real life milieu of a classical painter. They are impulsively inspired to buy the work from the artist himself, from the environment where the work was produced.

== Personalism in theology, love and art ==
According to tenets of Personalism, an Impersonal paradigm of divinity gives rise to the existential void and absence of values.
Love of impersonal objects, in preference to love of individuals, gives rise to materialism. Impersonalism in art is epitomized in abstract art.

Proponents of Rasa Renaissance see distortions in painting as sarcastic and cynical expressions. Rasa Art strives for simplicity, innocence, faith and devotion. Rasa Art strives for honesty to an indigenous aesthetic and an awareness of one's own beauty. Personalism sees man made in the image of God. There is no room for 'existential void'. Personalism focuses attention on love and grace amongst individuals, in preference to fascination with matter.

In 1914, the Danish ''Selskabet for Dekorativ Kunst'' (Company for Decorative Arts) launched its ''{{ill |Skønvirke |da}}'' (literally "Graceful Work") magazine. Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Jugendstil]].&lt;ref name=Rekkali&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rekkali |first1=Zeynep |title=Danish Design: The birth, rise, fall and resurrection |url=https://danish.tm/article/danish-design-birth-rise-fall-resurrection/ |publisher=Danish |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] (furniture, textiles),&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian design |url=https://www.scandinavia-design.fr/design-scandinave_en.html |publisher=Scandinavia design |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arne Jacobsen]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Borge Mogensen]] (furniture),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Hans J.

The [[Lunning Prize]], awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krondahl |first1=Hans |title=Tema Lunning Prize winners |url=http://runeberg.org/tema/lunning.html |publisher=Runeberg |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.&lt;ref name=Rekkali/&gt;{{sfn|Englund|Schmidt|Wood|2007}}{{sfn|Halén|Wickman|2003}} Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingdal |first1=Cecilie |title=Let there be light |url=https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/stories/cecilie-ingdal |publisher=[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new old principles of HMD's #Nokia design |url=http://nokiamob.net/2017/08/15/the-new-old-principles-of-hmds-nokia-design/ |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=3 January 2018 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Gavin |title=Designed to Delight |url=https://www.volvocars.com/intl/cars/new-models/xc60/stories/scandinavian-design |publisher=[[Volvo]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leary, Erin |title='The Total Absence of Foreign Subjects': The Racial Politics of US Interwar Exhibitions of Scandinavian Design |journal=Design and Culture |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=283–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Design is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production, such as [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s 1958 [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Chair|url=http://www.aram.co.uk/egg-chair.html|publisher=Aram|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul Henningsen]]'s 1926 [[PH-lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  title=The PH lamp |  publisher=Visit Denmark |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  archivedate=2012-02-15 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design.

===In Iceland===

Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design and Architecture {{!}} General information |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDICDESIGN/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also founded in 1998, soon followed by  its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively Icelandic character in the nation's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland Design Centre |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Sweden===
{{see|Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design}}

Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and [[Sami people|Sami]] handicrafts. Swedish design was pioneered by [[Anders Beckman]] (graphics), [[Bruno Mathsson]] (furniture), [[Märta Måås-Fjetterström]] and [[Astrid Sampe]] (textile), and [[Sixten Sason]] (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are [[Svensk Form]], the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the [[Swedish Industrial Design Foundation]], known as SVID; the [[Swedish Arts Council]]; and the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design]] (known as ArkDes) on the island of [[Skeppsholmen]] in Stockholm, beside the [[Moderna Museet|modern art museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stylish functionality |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/swedish-design/|publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[performing arts]], a '''stage mother''' is the mother of a [[child actor]]. The mother will often drive her child to auditions, make sure he or she is on the [[Set construction|set]] on time, etc.  The term ''stage mother'' sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist|title=Living Vicariously through Children with a Twist|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent.

==Definition==
A stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., [[Rose Thompson Hovick]], [[Dina Lohan]], [[Judy Garland|Ethel Gumm]], [[Teri Shields]], [[Hilary Duff|Susan Duff]], etc.) &amp;mdash; representing her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as "momagers" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="momager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/07/13/beyonce-manager-matthew-knowles-britney-spears-kardashian-simpson/#more-50228|title=From Beyonce To Britney Spears, Is It Ever A Good Idea To Be Managed By A Parent?|accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of "stage mother" can be affixed to the mother{{by whom|date=October 2014}} without cause. [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film ''[[Model Behavior]]'', it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie.

==Notable stage mothers==
{{main|List of stage mothers}}

==Stage fathers==
Fathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]] (patriarch of the [[Jackson family]]), [[Murry Wilson]] (father of three of [[The Beach Boys]]), Joe Simpson (father of [[Jessica Simpson|Jessica]] and [[Ashlee Simpson]]), Jeff Archuleta (father of ''[[American Idol]]'' runner-up [[David Archuleta]]), [[Mathew Knowles]] (father of [[Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles]]) and [[Kit Culkin]] (father of [[Macaulay Culkin|Macaulay]] and [[Kieran Culkin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705759/The-father-from-hell.html|title=The father from hell?|date=1996-11-09|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example of such a father was [[Leopold Mozart]], who recognized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his son's]] musical ability at an early age and made the most of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Holmes (musicologist) |date=1845 |title=The Life of Mozart Including His Correspondence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], father of Tejano superstar [[Selena]], is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days.

Stage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/03/16/lavar-ball-hurt-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-stock-ucla-march-madness/99248918/|title=Could LaVar Ball scare NBA teams from drafting Lonzo Ball?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and  backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates.&lt;ref&gt;"Was it Guys Like These who Ruined Sportsmanship....or was it Just Us?"

== Script mother ==
A variant of the term has been a "script mother", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

An example of a script mother has been [[Lynn Johnston]], who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip ''For Better or for Worse'', as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a [[private school]] with tougher regulations on student conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnston "Kate and I were constantly bullied due to the strip" Suddenly Silver, 25 Years of FBOFW, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"/&gt;

==History of art and social and political change==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."&lt;ref name=Groys&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;[[Cf.]] Silver 11, as qtd. in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n2_v55/ai_18533947/pg_3 book rev.] by Graham: "Power attracts artists and in turn promotes the artists who succeed within that power structure."  Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."&lt;ref name=Slackman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== The role of poetry ==

{{Quote|text=Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.|sign=[[Percy B. Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]|source=''[[A Defence of Poetry]]''}}

The Italian poet [[Ungaretti]], when interviewed on transgression by director [[Pasolini]] for the 1964 ''[[Love Meetings]]'' documentary, said that the foundation of [[poetry]] is to transgress all laws: "I am a poet and as such I begin transgressing all the laws by doing poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pasolini]] (1964) ''[[Love Meetings]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EerTTC-YO8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].&lt;ref name=Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Poli|first=Francesco|others=Trans. F. Scarpelli and A. Andreacchio|title=I situazionisti e la loro storia|editor=Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti|publisher=Manifestolibri|location=Rome|year=2006|pages=63|isbn=978-88-7285-438-9 |quote=caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms .&lt;ref name=Bandini&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandini|first=Mirella|title=L'estetico, il politico. Da Cobra all'Internazionale situazionista 1948-1957|publisher=Costa &amp; Nolan|year=1999|pages=408|isbn=978-88-7648-344-8|language=Italian|quote=Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;

===''Entropa''===
Czech [[sculptor]] [[David Černý]]'s ''[[Entropa]]'', a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the [[European Council|European Union Council]] during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entropa'' attracted controversy both for its [[stereotype]]d depictions of the various [[European Union|EU]] member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than, as Černý purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;  Some [[European Union|EU]] members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with [[Bulgaria]], for instance, deciding to summon the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Ambassador to [[Sofia]] in order to discuss the illustration of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] country as a collection of [[squat toilet]]s (ČTK).  This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former [[East Germany|East German]]&amp;ndash;[[West Germany|West German]] border in Berlin, a concert [[Public Broadcasting Service|telecast nationally]] in the United States, he substituted ''Freedom'' for ''Joy'' to reflect his own "personal message".&lt;ref&gt;

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".&lt;ref name="Robeson"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the account of the "Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration": "Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."&lt;ref name="Robeson"/&gt;

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Restrictions on live-music venues===
====In the United States====
In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a [[Draco (lawgiver)#"Draconian"|Draconian]] "anti-music law", the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in [[Seattle]], Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in [[United States Federal Courts|U.S. Federal Court]] in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPAC's suit, finding no Constitutional infringement of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and deciding that the matter is a political one for the [[Seattle City Council]] to decide, not the courts; during the course of the suit, Mayor Schell's successor, [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council, and, on 12 August 2002, the new All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) replaced the TDO,&lt;ref&gt;

====In the United Kingdom====
{{See|Licensing Act 2003#Impact on live music}}
Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the perceived "demand" for the information solicited on such "[[risk assessment]]" forms motivated [[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and The Makers]], to post an [[Internet petition|electronic petition]] in the "E-Petitions" section of the official website of [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], at  Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is "[[Racism|racial discrimination]]" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints,&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins: "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London music events".&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;  By 11 November 2008, according to Orlowski, "A dozen London boroughs [had] implemented a '[[risk assessment]]' [Form 696] policy for live music that permits the [[Metropolitan Police Service|police]] to ban any live music if they fail to receive personal details from the performers 14 days in advance."&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;  Orlowski points out: &lt;blockquote&gt;The demand explicitly singles out performances and musical styles favoured by the black community: [[Garage rock|garage]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]]. ... However all musical performances – from one man playing a guitar on up – are subject to the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue'. ... UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year. He said they weren't [[Wiktionary:compulsory|compulsory]]: ... 'We can't demand it – we recommend that you provide it as best practice. But you're bloody silly if you don't, because you're putting your venue at risk.'&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  By early March 2009, over 16,000 British citizens or residents had signed McClure's E-Petition, which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">In [[literature]], the '''tone''' of a literary work is the effect that the writer creates on the readers through choice of writing style. The overall objective is to express an attitude or certain feelings about the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Scheir|title=Roadmap To The California High School Exit Exam: English Language Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1vh2n29bVMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2004|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=978-0-375-76471-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Depending upon the personality of the writer and the effect the writer wants to create, the work can be formal or informal, sober or whimsical, assertive or pleading, straightforward or sly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In determining the attitude, mood, or tone of an author, examine the specific [[diction]] used.  Is the author using adjectives to describe the subject?  If so, are they words like ''fragrant, tranquil, magnanimous''—words with positive [[connotation]]s?  Or are they words like ''fetid, ruffled, stingy''—words with negative connotations?

When we speak, our tone of voice conveys our mood—frustrated, cheerful, critical, gloomy, or angry.  When we write, our images and descriptive phrases get our feelings across—guarded optimism, unqualified enthusiasm, objective indifference, resignation, or dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of literary tone are:  airy, comic, condescending, facetious, funny, heavy, intimate, ironic, light, playful, sad, serious, sinister, solemn, somber, threatening.

==Difference from mood==
Tone and [[mood (literature)|mood]] are not the same, although they are frequently confused. The mood of a piece of literature is the feeling or atmosphere created by the work, or, said slightly differently, how the work makes the reader feel. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone, while tone is how the author feels about something.

==Usage==
All pieces of literature, even official documents and technical documents, have some sort of tone.  Authors create  tone   through the use of various other literary elements, such as ''diction'' or word choice; ''syntax'', the grammatical arrangement of words in a text for effect; ''imagery'', or vivid appeals to the senses; ''details'', facts that are included or omitted; and ''figurative language'', the comparison of  seemingly unrelated things for sub-textual  purposes.{{how|date=October 2013}}

While now used to discuss literature, the term tone was originally applied solely to music. This appropriated word has come to represent attitudes and feelings a speaker (in poetry), a narrator (in fiction), or an author (in non-literary prose) has towards the subject, situation, and/or the intended audience. It is important to recognize that the  speaker, or narrator is not to be confused with the author and that attitudes and feelings of the  speaker or narrator should not be confused with those of the author.{{why |date=October 2013}}  In general, the tone of a piece only refers to attitude of the author if writing is non-literary in nature.{{Elucidate |date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Alison, and Kelly J. Mays, eds.  "Theme and Tone." ''The Norton Introduction to Literature'', Portable 10th ed. New York: Norton, 2010. 475-6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the tone of a work may change and shift as the speaker or narrator’s perspective on a particular subject alters throughout the piece.

Official and technical documentation tends to employ a formal tone throughout the piece.

==Setting tone==
Authors set a tone in literature by conveying emotions/feelings through words. The way a person feels about an idea/concept, event, or another person can be quickly determined through facial expressions, gestures and in the tone of voice used.  In literature an author sets the tone through words.  The possible tones are bounded only by the number of possible [[emotion]]s a human being can have.

Diction and [[syntax]] often dictate what the author's (or character's) attitude toward his subject is at the time. An example: "Charlie surveyed the classroom but it was really his mother congratulating himself for snatching the higher test grade, the smug smirk on his face growing brighter and brighter as he confirmed the inferiority of his peers."

The tone here is one of arrogance; the quip "inferiority of his peers" shows Charlie's belief in his own prowess. The words "surveyed" and "congratulating himself" show Charlie as seeing himself better than the rest of his class.  The diction, including the word "snatching", gives the reader a mental picture of someone quickly and effortlessly grabbing something, which proves once again Charlie's pride in himself. The "smug [[smirk]]" provides a facial imagery of Charlie's pride.

In addition, using imagery in a poem is helpful to develop a poem's tone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8357">'''The Triangle Network '''(formally known as the''' '''Triangle Arts Trust) is an international arts organization that brings together artists from different countries to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Triangle was initiated through a series of artists' workshops providing an uninterrupted period of two weeks where 20–25 artists from diverse [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds engage with each other, to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Now the Triangle Network coalesces grassroots arts organisations around the world (many of which were initiated as workshops while others grew independently), in order that artists' mobility, international cultural exchange and capacity building objectives can be shared.

The Triangle Network is registered as a charitable organization in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends11%5C0000326411_AC_20040331_E_C.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Triangle Network was established in 1982 by [[Robert Loder]] and [[Anthony Caro]], and is organised as a network of [[artist]]s, [[visual art]] organisations, and artists-led workshops. It currently is active in over 30 countries. Each centre within the Network is independent and set up to respond to local needs. The object of the workshops is "to counterbalance the tendency of the Western art world to put the emphasis on the object and its marketing rather than on the creative process itself".

David Elliott was appointed to Chair the Board, succeeding Robert Loder who retired in 2009. Loder remained a Trustee of the organization until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=32071|title=Triangle Arts Trust Announced the Appointment of David Elliott as the Chair of the Board of Triangle Arts Trust|author=Ignacio Villarreal|work=artdaily.org|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">The '''two headed alligator''' is a [[Fearsome critters|folkloric animal]] of the [[United States|American]] state of [[Florida]]. Its history is focused mainly within the neighborhood of [[Seminole Heights]] in the city of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where it appears on the official seal. It is also the subject of art murals, statues, flags, tee-shirts and other ephemera related to the neighborhood.

== Origins ==
[[File:Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for North Tampa Pan-Am Garage Seminole Heights history Florida Ave]]
The earliest recorded reference to the two headed alligator was in 1911 when real estate developer, T. Roy Young and his Seminole Development Company purchased 40 acres of land and developed Seminole Heights, Tampa's first suburb. In the promotion of the real estate venture, Young adopted an image of a two headed alligator as part of a neighborhood seal.

A folktale entitled, ''Bite or Smite'', was recorded by R. Perez and A.L. Lopez in 1930 during their research on local superstitions for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writers’ Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration|Work Projects Administration]] for the State of Florida. Like many folktales from the region, its characters consist of an anthropomorphic rabbit, alligator and turtle. In the story, the rabbit ignores the warning of the turtle and is eaten by the alligator, who had been concealing a second head. Since it is difficult to date the creation of folklore, it is unclear whether Bite or Smite was the inspiration for, or inspired by, the Seminole Heights seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 Sighting ==
In 2014, a man claiming to be a "local naturalist" sent an image of a two-headed alligator he spotted at a Seminole Heights park to the local newspaper, [[Tampa Bay Times]], who ran the image on the cover of the follow day's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/01/Two-headed-alligator-spotted-in-Florida/5141404226010/|title=Two-headed alligator spotted in Florida?|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story became an international headline, scientists started to question the authenticity of the creature. The story was later discovered to be a hoax.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/its-a-total-crock/2186639|title= That photo of a two-headed Seminole Heights alligator? It's a total crock!}}&lt;/ref&gt;A local restaurant, [[Ella's Folkart Cafe]], displays a taxidermied two headed alligator that it claims was caught by local trappers soon after the news story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/46112|title=Tampa, FL - Famous Two-Headed Alligator|website=RoadsideAmerica.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statue ==
In 2016 a Seminole Heights community art fund, [[Urban Art Attack]], funded the building of a 6-foot two headed alligator statue in front of Southern Brewing and Winemaking at 4500 Nebraska Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue-turning-heads-seminole-heights|title=Two-Headed Alligator (Statue) Turning Heads in Seminole Heights|newspaper=Seminole Heights, FL Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vernacular''', or '''vernacular language''', is the [[language]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a language used in everyday life by the common people of a specific population. It is distinguished from a [[standard language|standard]], [[National language|national]] or [[Literary language|literary]] language or a ''[[lingua franca]]'', used to facilitate communication across a large area. It is usually [[Native language|native]], mostly [[Spoken language|spoken]] rather than written and usually [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|seen as of lower status]] than more standardized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8L-SDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT559&amp;dq=vernacular+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV1Ly707jbAhVpLcAKHZmuA4IQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vernacular%20language&amp;f=false|title=The Study of Language 6th Edition|last=Yule|first=George|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316776780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a language, [[dialect]] or [[sociolect]].

Some linguists use "vernacular" and "[[nonstandard dialect]]" as [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
Usage of the word "vernacular" is not recent. In 1688, James Howell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning Italy, doubtless there were divers before the Latin did spread all over that Country; the [[Calabria|Calabrian]], and [[Apulia|Apulian]] spoke Greek, whereof some Relicks are [[Griko dialect|to be found to this day]]; but it was an adventitious, no Mother-Language to them: 'tis confess'd that [[Latium]] it self, and all the Territories about Rome, had the Latin for its maternal and common first '''vernacular''' Tongue; but [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]] had others quite discrepant, [[viz.]] the [[Etruscan language|Hetruscane]] and [[Messapian language|Mesapian]], whereof though there be some Records yet extant; yet there are none alive that can understand them: The [[Oscan language|Oscan]], the [[Sabine language|Sabin]] and Tusculan, are thought to be but Dialects to these.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, vernacular, mother language and dialect are already in use in a modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epistolæ Ho-Elianæ: Familiar letters, domestic and forren |first=James |last=Howell |location=London |publisher=Thomas Grey |year=1688 |edition=6th |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Merriam-Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernacular |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/VERNACULAR |accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "vernacular" was brought into the English language as early as 1601 from the Latin ''vernaculus'' ("native") which had been in figurative use in [[Classical Latin]] as "national" and "domestic", having originally been derived from ''vernus'' and ''verna'', a male or female slave respectively born in the house rather than abroad. The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words ''vernaculus, vernacula''. [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the classical Latin grammarian, used the term ''vocabula vernacula'', "termes de la langue nationale" or "vocabulary of the national language" as opposed to foreign words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernaculus |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire Illustré Latin Français |first=Felix |last=Gaffiot |publisher=Librairie Hachette |location=Paris |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts of the vernacular ==

===General linguistics===

====In contrast with lingua franca====

[[File:Incunabula distribution by language.png|thumb|Ratio of books printed in the vernacular languages to those in Latin in the 15th century&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Linguistics|general linguistics]], a vernacular is contrasted with a ''[[lingua franca]]'', a third-party language in which persons speaking different vernaculars not understood by each other may communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to sociolinguistics |first=Ronald |last=Wardhaugh |location=Malden, Mass.; Oxford |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |year=2006 |page=59 |quote=In 1953, UNESCO defined a lingua franca as 'a language which is used habitually by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate communication between them.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Western Europe]] until the 17th century, most scholarly works had been written in [[Latin]], which was serving as a lingua franca. Works written in [[Romance language]]s are said to be in the vernacular. The ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', and [[The Song of Roland]] are examples of early vernacular literature in Italian, Spanish, and French, respectively.

In Europe, Latin was used widely instead of vernacular languages in varying forms until c. 1701, in its latter stage as [[New Latin]].

In religion, [[Protestantism]] was a driving force in the use of the vernacular in Christian Europe, the [[Bible]] being translated from Latin into vernacular languages with such works as the Bible in Dutch: published in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]]; Bible in French: published in 1528 by Jacques Lefevre d’Étaples (or Faber Stapulensis); German [[Luther Bible]] in 1534 ([[New Testament]] 1522); Bible in Spanish: published in Basel in 1569 by Casiodoro de Reina (Biblia del Oso); Bible in Czech: Bible of Kralice, printed between 1579 and 1593; Bible in English: [[King James Bible]], published in 1611; Bible in Slovene, published in 1584 by Jurij Dalmatin. In Catholicism, vernacular bibles were later provided, but Latin was used at [[Tridentine Mass]] until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1965. Certain groups, notably [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, continue to practice [[Latin Mass]].

In India, the 12th century [[Bhakti movement]] led to the translation of Sanskrit texts to the vernacular.

In science, an early user of the vernacular was [[Galileo]], writing in Italian c. 1600, though some of his works remained in Latin. A later example is [[Isaac Newton]], whose 1687 ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was in Latin, but whose 1704 ''[[Opticks]]'' was in English. Latin continues to be used in certain fields of science, notably [[binomial nomenclature]] in biology, while other fields such as mathematics use vernacular; see [[scientific nomenclature]] for details.

In diplomacy, French displaced Latin in Europe in the 1710s, due to the military power of [[Louis XIV of France]].

Certain languages have both a classical form and various vernacular forms, with two widely used examples being Arabic and Chinese: see [[Varieties of Arabic]] and [[Chinese language]]. In the 1920s, due to the [[May Fourth Movement]], [[Classical Chinese]] was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]].

{{details|Vernacular literature}}

====As a low variant in diglossia====
The vernacular is also often contrasted with a [[liturgical language]], a specialized use of a former ''lingua franca''. For example, until the 1960s, [[Roman Rite]] Catholics held [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] in [[Latin]] rather than in vernaculars; to this day the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] holds [[liturgy|liturgies]] in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], not Arabic; the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] holds liturgies in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] though parts of Mass are read in [[Amharic]].

Similarly, in [[Hindu]] culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in [[Sanskrit]] (long after its use as a spoken language) or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in Tamil country. Sanskrit was a lingua franca among the non-Indo-European languages of the Indian subcontinent and became more of one as the spoken language, or [[prakrit]]s, began to diverge from it in different regions. With the rise of the [[bhakti movement]] from the 12th century onwards, religious works were created in the other languages: [[Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and many others. For example, the [[Ramayana]], one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as ''[[Ranganadha Ramayanam]]'' composed in Telugu by [[Reddy dynasty|Gona Buddha Reddy]] in the 15th century; and ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', a Hindi version of the Ramayana by the 16th-century poet [[Tulsidas]].

These circumstances are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant used by the same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed [[diglossia]] ("split tongue", on the model of the genetic anomaly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=diglossia |encyclopedia=Stedman's Medical Dictionary |year=1918 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In it, the language is bifurcated, i.e. the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. H must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson's own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between [[Vulgar Latin]] and [[Classical Latin]] is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.

[[Joshua Fishman]] redefined the concept in 1964 to include everything Fergusen had excluded. Fishman allowed both different languages and dialects and also different styles and registers as the H variants. The essential contrast between them was that they be "functionally differentiated"; that is, H must be used for special purposes, such as a liturgical or sacred language. Fasold expanded the concept still further by proposing that multiple H exist in society from which the users can select for various purposes. The definition of an H is intermediate between Ferguson's and Fishman's. Realizing the inappropriateness of the term diglossia (only two) to his concept, he proposes the term broad diglossia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|pp=34–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
Within [[sociolinguistics]], the term "vernacular" has been applied to several concepts. Context, therefore, is crucial to determining its intended sense.

====As an informal register====
In variation theory, pioneered by [[William Labov]], language is a large set of styles or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from which the speaker selects according to the social setting of the moment. The vernacular is "the least self-conscious style of people in a relaxed conversation", or "the most basic style"; that is, casual varieties used spontaneously rather than self-consciously, informal talk used in intimate situations. In other contexts the speaker does conscious work to select the appropriate variations. The one he can use without this effort is the first form of speech acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesthrie|1999|pp=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a non-standard dialect====
In another theory, the vernacular is opposed to the standard. The non-standard varieties thus defined are dialects, which are to be identified as complexes of factors: "social class, region, ethnicity, situation, and so forth." Both the standard and the non-standard language have dialects, but in contrast to the standard, the non-standard have "socially disfavored" structures. The standard are primarily written (in traditional print media) but the non-standard are spoken. An example of a vernacular dialect is [[African American Vernacular English]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{cite book |title=American English: dialects and variation |first=Walt |last=Wolfram |first2=Natalie |last2=Schilling-Estes |pages=13–16 |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As an idealisation====
A vernacular is not a real language but is "an abstract set of norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lodge|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular grammar ==
Vernaculars acquired the status of [[official language]]s through [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] publications. Between 1437 and 1586, the first [[grammar]] of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] were written, though not always immediately published. It is to be understood that the first vestiges of those languages preceded their standardization by up to several hundred years.

=== Dutch ===
In the 16th century, the "[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijkerskamers]]", learned literary societies founded throughout [[Flanders]] and [[Holland]] from the 1420s onward, attempted to impose a Latin structure on Dutch, on the presumption that Latin grammar had a "universal character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noordegraaf|2000|p=894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1559 [[John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst]] published his grammar ''Den schat der Duytsscher Talen'' in Dutch and so did [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]] (''Eenen nieuwen ABC of Materi-boeck'') in 1564. The Latinizing tendency changed course with the joint publication in 1584 by De Eglantier, the rhetoric society of Amsterdam, of the first comprehensive Dutch grammar, ''Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst/ ófte Vant spellen ende eyghenscap des Nederduitschen taals''. [[Hendrick Laurenszoon Spieghel]] was a major contributor but others contributed as well.

=== English ===
{{details|History of English}}
[[Modern English]] is considered to have begun at a conventional date of about 1550, most notably at the end of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for example, "bot", the footwear, more as in "boat" to "boot"){{clarify|date=April 2011}}. It was created by the infusion of [[Old French]] into [[Old English]] after the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 AD and of Latin at the instigation of the clerical administration. While present-day English-speaking students may be able to read [[Middle English]] authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] with some schooling, [[Old English]] is much more difficult.

[[Middle English]] is known for its alternative spellings and pronunciations. The British Isles, although geographically limited, have always supported populations of widely variant dialects (as well as a few different languages). Being the language of a maritime power, English was of necessity formed from elements of many different languages. Standardization has been an ongoing issue. Even in the age of modern communications and mass media, according to one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Authority in language: investigating language prescription and standardisation |first=James |last=Milroy|first2=Lesley |last2=Milroy |page=29 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "… although the Received Pronunciation of Standard English has been heard constantly on radio and then television for over 60 years, only 3 to 5% of the population of Britain actually speaks RP … new brands of English have been springing up even in recent times ...." What the vernacular would be in this case is a moot point: "… the standardisation of English has been in progress for many centuries."

Modern English came into being as the standard Middle English, i.e. as the preferred dialect of the monarch, court and administration. That dialect was East Midland, which had spread to [[London]] where the king resided and from which he ruled. It contained Danish forms not often used in the north or south, as the Danes had settled heavily in the midlands. Chaucer wrote in an early East Midland style, [[John Wycliffe]] translated the [[New Testament]] into it, and [[William Caxton]], the first English printer, wrote in it. Caxton is considered the first modern English author.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Champneys|1893|pp=269, 285–286, 301, 314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed book in England was Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', published by Caxton in 1476.

The first English grammars were written in [[Latin]], with some in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a general plea for mother-tongue education in England: ''The first part of the elementary'', published in 1582 by [[Richard Mulcaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bullokar]] wrote the first English grammar to be written in English: ''Pamphlet for Grammar'', followed by ''Bref Grammar'', both in 1586. Previously he had written ''Booke at Large for the Amendment of Orthography for English Speech'' (1580) but his orthography was not generally accepted and was soon supplanted, and his grammar shared a similar fate. Other grammars in English followed rapidly: Paul Greaves' ''Grammatica Anglicana'', 1594; [[Alexander Hume]]'s ''Orthographie and Congruitie of the Britain Tongue'', 1617, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the succeeding decades many literary figures turned a hand to grammar in English: [[Alexander Gill]], [[Ben Jonson]], Joshua Poole, [[John Wallis]], Jeremiah Wharton, [[James Howell]], Thomas Lye, [[Christopher Cooper (grammarian)|Christopher Cooper]], [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]], [[John Colet]] and so on, all leading to the massive dictionary of [[Samuel Johnson]].

=== French ===
{{details|Old French}}
French (as [[Old French]]) emerged as a [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] during [[late antiquity]]. The written language is known from at least as early as the 9th century. That language contained many forms still identifiable as Latin. Interest in standardizing French began in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Anglo-Norman domains in both northwestern France and Britain, English scholars retained an interest in the fate of French as well as of English. Some of the numerous 16th-century surviving grammars are:

* [[John Palsgrave]], ''L'esclarcissement de la langue francoyse'' (1530; in English).
* Louis Meigret, ''Tretté de la grammaire françoeze'' (1550).
* Robert Stephanus: ''Traicté de la grammaire françoise'' (1557).

=== German ===
{{details|History of German}}
The development of a standard German was impeded by political disunity and strong local traditions until the invention of printing made possible a "[[High German]]-based book language."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[literary language]] was not identical to any specific variety of German. The first grammar evolved from pedagogical works that also tried to create a uniform standard from the many regional dialects for various reasons. Religious leaders wished to create a sacred language for [[Protestantism]] that would be parallel to the use of Latin for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Various administrations wished to create a civil service, or chancery, language that would be useful in more than one locality. And finally, nationalists wished to counter the spread of the French national language into German-speaking territories assisted by the efforts of the French Academy.

With so many linguists moving in the same direction a standard German (''hochdeutsche Schriftsprache'') did evolve without the assistance of a language academy. Its precise origin, the major constituents of its features, remains uncertainly known and debatable. Latin prevailed as a [[lingua franca]] until the 17th century, when grammarians began to debate the creation of an ideal language. Before 1550 as a conventional date "supraregional compromises" were used in printed works, such as the one published by Valentin Ickelsamer (''Ein Teutsche Grammatica'') 1534. Books published in one of these artificial variants began to increase in frequency replacing the Latin then in use. After 1550 the supraregional ideal broadened to a universal intent to create a national language from [[Early New High German]] by deliberately ignoring regional forms of speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Nils |last=Langer |contribution=On the Importance of Foreign Language Grammars for a History of Standard German |title=Standardization: studies from the Germanic languages |editor-first=Andrew Robert |editor-last=Linn |editor2-first=Nicola |editor2-last=McLelland |series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 235 |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |year=2002 |pages=69–70 |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; which practice was considered to be a form of purification parallel to the ideal of purifying religion in [[Protestantism]].

In 1617, the [[Fruitbearing Society]], a language club, was formed in [[Weimar]] in imitation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Italy. It was one of many such clubs; however, none became a national academy. In 1618–1619 Johannes Kromayer wrote the first all-German grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641 Justin Georg Schottel in ''teutsche Sprachkunst'' presented the standard language as an artificial one. By the time of his work of 1663, ''ausführliche Arbeit von der teutschen Haubt-Sprache'', the standard language was well established.

=== Irish ===
''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' is a grammar of the [[Irish language]] which is thought to date back as far as the 7th century: the earliest surviving manuscripts are 12th-century.

=== Italian ===
{{details|Italian language}}
Italian appears before standardization as the ''lingua Italica'' of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and the ''lingua vulgaris'' of subsequent medieval writers. Documents of mixed Latin and Italian are known from the 12th century, which appears to be the start of writing in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known grammar of a Romance language was a book written in manuscript form by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1437 and 1441 and entitled ''Grammatica della lingua toscana'', "Grammar of the Tuscan Language." In it Alberti sought to demonstrate that the vernacular – here Tuscan, known today as modern Italian – was every bit as structured as Latin. He did so by mapping vernacular structures onto Latin.

The book was never printed until 1908. It was not generally known, but it was known, as an inventory of the library of [[Lorenzo de'Medici]] lists it under the title ''Regule lingue florentine'' ("Rules of the Florentine language"). The only known manuscript copy, however, is included in the [[codex]], Reginense Latino 1370, located at Rome in the [[Vatican library]]. It is therefore called the ''Grammatichetta vaticana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of the Language Sciences / Histoire des sciences du langage / Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften,  Part 1 |editor-first=Sylvain |editor-last=Auroux |editor2-first=E.

More influential perhaps were the 1516 ''Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua'' of Giovanni Francesco Fortunio and the 1525 ''Prose della vulgar lingua'' of [[Pietro Bembo]]. In those works the authors strove to establish a dialect that would qualify for becoming the Italian national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occitan ===
The very first grammar in a vernacular language in western Europe was published in [[Toulouse]] in 1327. Known as the ''[[Leys d'amor]]'' and written by Guilhèm Molinièr, an [[advocate]] of Toulouse, it was published in order to codify the use of the [[Occitan]] language in poetry competitions organized by the company of the [[Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals|Gai Saber]] in both grammar and rherotical ways.

=== Spanish ===
{{details|History of Spanish}}
Spanish (more accurately, ''la lengua castellana'') has a development chronologically similar to that of Italian: some vocabulary in Isidore of Seville, traces afterward, writing from about the 12th century, standardization beginning in the 15th century, coincident with the rise of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] as an international power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish grammar by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana|Tratado de gramática sobre la lengua Castellana]]'', 1492) was divided into parts for native and nonnative speakers, pursuing a different purpose in each:  Books 1–4 describe the [[Spanish language]] grammatically in order to facilitate the study of Latin for its Spanish speaking readers. Book 5 contains a phonetical and morphological overview of Spanish for nonnative speakers.

=== Welsh ===
The ''Grammar Books of the Master-poets'' ({{lang-cy|Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid}}) are considered to have been composed in the early fourteenth century, and are present in manuscripts from soon after. These tractates draw on the traditions of the Latin grammars of Donatus and Priscianus and also on the teaching of the professional Welsh poets. The tradition of grammars of the [[Welsh Language]] developed from these through the Middle Ages and to the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |editor-first=John |editor-last=Koch |contribution=Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid |first=R. Geraint |last=Gruffudd |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |pages=843–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular dictionaries ==
A dictionary is to be distinguished from a [[glossary]]. Although numerous glossaries publishing vernacular words had long been in existence, such as the [[Etymologiae]] of [[Isidore of Seville]], which listed many Spanish words, the first vernacular [[dictionaries]] emerged together with vernacular grammars.

=== Dutch ===
Glossaries in Dutch began about 1470 AD leading eventually to two [[Dutch dictionaries]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christophe Plantin]]: ''Thesaurus Theutonicae Linguae'', 1573
* [[Cornelis Kiliaan]]: ''Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum'', 1574 (becoming ''Etymologicum'' with the 1599 3rd edition)

Shortly after (1579) the [[Southern Netherlands]] came under the dominion of Spain, then of Austria (1713) and of France (1794). The [[Congress of Vienna]] created the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 from which southern Netherlands (being Catholic) seceded in 1830 to form the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], which was confirmed in 1839 by the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this political instability no standard Dutch was defined (even though much in demand and recommended as an ideal) until after [[World War II]]. Currently the [[Dutch Language Union]], an international treaty organization founded in 1980, supports a standard Dutch in the Netherlands, while [[Afrikaans]] is regulated by [[Die Taalkommissie]] founded in 1909.

=== English ===
[[Standard English]] remains a quasi-fictional ideal, despite the numerous private organizations publishing prescriptive rules for it. No language academy was ever established or espoused by any government past or present in the English-speaking world. In practice the British monarchy and its administrations established an ideal of what good English should be considered to be, and this in turn was based on the teachings of the major universities, such as [[Cambridge University]] and [[Oxford University]], which relied on the scholars whom they hired. There is a general but far from uniform consensus among the leading scholars about what should or should not be said in standard English, but for every rule examples from famous English writers can be found that break it. Uniformity of spoken English never existed and does not exist now, but usages do exist, which must be learnt by the speakers, and do not conform to prescriptive rules.

Usages have been documented not by prescriptive grammars, which on the whole are less comprehensible to the general public, but by comprehensive dictionaries, often termed unabridged, which attempt to list all usages of words and the phrases in which they occur as well as the date of first use and the etymology where possible. These typically require many volumes, and yet not more so than the unabridged dictionaries of many languages.

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries precede modern English and were in use in the earliest written English. The first monolingual dictionary was&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Cawdrey]]'s ''Table Alphabeticall'' (1604) which was followed by [[Edward Phillips]]'s ''A New World of English Words'' (1658) and [[Nathaniel Bailey]]'s ''[[An Universal Etymological English Dictionary]]'' (1721). These dictionaries whetted the interest of the English-speaking public in greater and more prescriptive dictionaries until [[Samuel Johnson]] published ''Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language'' (1747), which would imitate the dictionary being produced by the French Academy. He had no problem acquiring the funding, but not as a prescriptive dictionary. This was to be a grand comprehensive dictionary of all English words at any period, ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755).

By 1858, the need for an update resulted in the first planning for a new comprehensive dictionary to document standard English, a term coined at that time by the planning committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary, known as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', published its first fascicle in 1884. It attracted significant contributions from some singular minds, such as [[William Chester Minor]], a former army surgeon who had become criminally insane and made most of his contributions while incarcerated. Whether the OED is the long-desired standard English Dictionary is debatable, but its authority is taken seriously by the entire English-speaking world. Its staff is currently working on a third edition.

=== French ===
Surviving dictionaries are a century earlier than their grammars. The [[Académie française]] founded in 1635 was given the obligation of producing a standard dictionary. Some early dictionaries are:
* Louis Cruse, alias Garbin: ''Dictionaire latin-françois'', 1487
* [[Robert Estienne]], alias Robertus Stephanus: ''Dictionnaire françois–latin'', 1539
* Maurice de la Porte: ''Epitheta'', 1571
* [[Jean Nicot]]: ''Thresor de la langue fracoyse, tant ancienne que moderne'', 1606
* Pierre Richelet: ''Dictionnaire françois contenant les mots et les choses'', 1680
* [[Académie française]]: ''[[Dictionnaire de l’Académie française]]'', 1694 ''annis''.

=== German ===
[[High German]] dictionaries began in the 16th century and were at first multi-lingual. They were preceded by glossaries of German words and phrases on various specialized topics. Finally interest in developing a vernacular German grew to the point where Maaler could publish a work called by [[Jacob Grimm]] "the first truly German dictionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Maaler's ''Die Teutsche Spraach: Dictionarium Germanico-latinum novum'' (1561).

It was followed along similar lines by Georg Heinisch: ''Teütsche Sprache und Weißheit'' (1616). After numerous dictionaries and glossaries of a less-than-comprehensive nature came a [[thesaurus]] that attempted to include all German, Kaspar Stieler's ''Der Teutschen Sprache Stammbaum und Fortwachs oder Teutschen Sprachschatz'' (1691), and finally the first codification of written German,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]'s ''Versuch eines vollständigen grammatisch-kritischen Wörterbuches Der Hochdeutschen Mundart'' (1774–1786).[[Schiller]] called Adelung an ''Orakel'' and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] is said to have nailed a copy to his desk.

In the early 15th century a number of glossaries appeared, such as that of Lucillo Minerbi on [[Boccaccio]] in 1535, and those of Fabrizio Luna on [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Boccaccio and [[Dante]] in 1536. In the mid-16th the dictionaries began, as listed below. In 1582 the first language academy was formed, called Accademia della Crusca, "bran academy", which sifted language like grain. Once formed, its publications were standard-setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance and reform: the Italian contribution|first=Frances Amelia |last=Yates| page=18|volume=Volume 2|year=1983|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient historical era==
{{Women in society sidebar}}

===India===
"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. 

=== Sculpture ===
[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Studio Club]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm'' by Clint B.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

[[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N.

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] listed 307 women environmental artists, such as [[Marina DeBris]], [[Vernita Nemec]] and [[Betty Beaumont]]. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=Our Town, Central|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/-145278-ocprint--.html|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to educate children about beach trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OC... and Sculpture by the Sea!|url=http://www.sutherland-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/oc-by-the-sea|publisher=Sutherland Public School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernita Nemec Segments of Endless Junkmail|url=http://artdaily.com/news/19141/Vernita-Nemec-Segments-of-Endless-Junkmail|publisher=Artdaily.org, The First Art Newspaper on the Net|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni Awards|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/alumni-friends/distinguished-alumni-award/alumni-2006/|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Camouflaged Cells Betty Beaumont|journal=Newfound Journal|date=Winter 2011|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.newfoundjournal.org/archives/volume-2/issue-1/photography-beaumont/|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation in art history==
[[Image:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith Leyster]], ''Self-portrait'', 1630, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
[[Image:Villers Young Woman Drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Marie-Denise Villers]], ''Young Woman Drawing'' 1801, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S. Barnes]]: [[South Brunswick, New Jersey]], and [[New York City|New York]], 1968) {{ISBN|1-125-32317-5}} [A second edition of this book was published in July 1969 (Yoseloff: [[London]], {{ISBN|0-498-06974-5}}; also {{ISBN|978-0-498-06974-1}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like this create a discontinuity of identity for women artists.
* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by [[Judith Leyster]] (1630) that were reassigned to [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. "Judith Leyster," ''Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'' vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190–198; 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofrichter, Frima Fox. "Judith Leyster: Leading Star," ''Judith Leyster: A Dutch Master and Her World'', (Yale University, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;Molenaer, Judith.

Accessed Feb. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Denise Villers]] (1774–1821) was a French painter who specialized in [[portrait]]s. Villers was a student of the French painter [[Girodet]]. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.

[[File:Etty Britomart 1833.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret]]'', [[William Etty]] (1833)]]

The portrayal of '''[[Warrior|women warriors]]''' in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a [[counter stereotype]], opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine.&lt;ref name="Stringer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringer|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=Radner|editor1-first=Hilary|editor2-last=Stringer|editor2-first=Rebecca|title=Feminism at the Movies|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=From Victim to Vigilante: Gender, Violence, and Revenge in ''The Brave One'' (2007) and ''Hard Candy'' (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}} This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and [[gender roles]] in society.

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:Medieval women as warriors.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval women helping to defend the city from attack.]]
{{See also|List of women warriors in folklore}}
In Hindu mythology, [[Chitrāngadā]], wife of [[Arjuna]], was the commander of her father's armies.

The [[Amazons]] were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. "Amazon" has become an [[eponym]] for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.

In British mythology, [[Queen Cordelia]] fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is Queen [[Boudica]], who lead a rebellion against the [[Roman Empire]].

In his ''On the Bravery of Women'' the Greco-Roman historian [[Plutarch]] describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of [[Telesilla]] in the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/A.html|title=Plutarch • On the Bravery of Women — Sections I‑XV|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Plant, I.M.|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806136219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC|page=33|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, film, and television==
{{See also|List of female action heroes and villains}}
Literary women warriors include "[[Gordafarid]]" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem [[The Shāhnāmeh]], [[Delhemma]] in [[Arabic epic literature]], [[Mulan]], [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Belphoebe]] and [[Britomartis|Britomart]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Bradamante]] and [[Marfisa]] in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Clorinda (Jerusalem Delivered)|Clorinda]] and (reluctantly) Erminia in ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]'', and [[Grendel's mother]].

The woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.&lt;ref name="Heinecken"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the Female Body in Popular Media|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|last1=Dawn|first1=Heinecken}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasker|first1=Yvonne|title=Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

Women warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood.&lt;ref name="Stringer" /&gt;{{rp|269}}  Professor Sherrie Inness in ''Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/945.html Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in ''Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2003-catalog/athenas-daughters.html Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors]''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, focus on figures such as [[Xena]], from the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' or [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and [[Girl Power|girl power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 Book review]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Violence===
Although there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like ''[[Kill Bill]]'' still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression.&lt;ref name=Lavin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavin|first1=Maud|title=Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women|date=2010|publisher=MIT|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108,237}} Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=Verstraten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verstraten|first1=Katelyn|title=For Indigenous Women, Radical Art as a Last Resort|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2013/06/22/Radical-Art/|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=The Tyee|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]''.&lt;ref name=Stringer /&gt;{{rp|269}}
