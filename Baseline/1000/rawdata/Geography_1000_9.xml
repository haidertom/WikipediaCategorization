      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6928">The '''Alberta Township System (ATS)''' is a land [[surveying]] system used in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Alberta]] and other parts of [[western Canada]].

==History and background==
In principle there is a mathematical basis for the Alberta Township System (ATS) variant of the [[Dominion Land Survey]] (DLS) system as implemented in Canada. The implementation in western Canada reflects a number of slightly different approaches, as well as a large number of errors.

Long before the Dominion Land Surveyor (DLS) first came into official existence in 1872, licensed surveyors known as Provincial Land Surveyors had been functioning in the Provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] (then called [[Canada West]] and [[Canada East]]) under an Act of 1849. Establishing a system of examination for new aspirants to the title of "Dominion Land Surveyor" was officially adopted in 1874. In 1910 The Alberta Surveyors Act prescribed the system and the methods whereby land surveys were to be carried out under the general purview of a provincial Director of Surveys whose responsibility it was to see that all survey work was performed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.landsurveyinghistory.ab.ca/ALSAStory/Association_Story-1905.htm| title= Alberta's Survey History| author= Alberta Land Surveyors' Association| accessdate= 2007-02-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070227215435/http://www.landsurveyinghistory.ab.ca/ALSAStory/Association_Story-1905.htm| archivedate= 2007-02-27| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is also used by provincial governments when selling exploration rights, and oil and gas wells are referenced by their location as defined within the Alberta Township System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinookconsulting.ca/News/Alberta-Township-System.html|title=Alberta Township System|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
[[File:Dominion-land-system-overview.png|thumb|right|300px|Townships in relation with meridians, baselines and correction lines]]
Below is a brief description of how to lay out the [[Dominion Land Survey|DLS]] grid for [[Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.ab.ca/system.htm |title=Alberta's Township System |author=Alberta Land Surveyors' Association |accessdate=2007-02-13 |date=February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202090722/http://www.alsa.ab.ca/system.htm |archivedate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ags.gov.ab.ca/gis/map_converters/map_conversion_explanation.html |title=Alberta Township System (ATS) |author=Alberta Geological Survey |date=July 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420145953/http://www.ags.gov.ab.ca/gis/map_converters/map_conversion_explanation.html |archivedate=2009-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lay off {{convert|6.0375|mi|km|adj=on}} ticks from the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] of latitude to the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]]. This gives 127 [[township]] lines.

The 49th parallel of [[latitude]] is the first base line of the ATS system. On it lay off {{convert|6.0750|mi|km|adj=on}} ticks westwards starting at the [[110th meridian west|110th line]] of [[longitude]] (4th DLS meridian). Start over at the [[114th meridian west|114th]] and [[118th meridian west|118th]] lines of longitude (5th and 6th DLS meridians). Extend these ticks {{convert|12.0750|mi|km}} due north (following a line of constant longitude) to the first correction line. This gets you your first set of range lines.

Starting at the 49th parallel (first base line) go {{convert|24.1500|mi|km}} directly north. This gets you to the second base line. At the latitude corresponding to this distance from the 49th parallel lay off {{convert|6.0750|mi|km|adj=on}} ticks westwards from 110th [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] as you did at the 1st base line. The circumference of the earth has decreased as you went northwards, so there will be fewer full ticks than there were one base line south. Extend {{convert|12.0750|mi|km}} north and {{convert|12.0750|mi|km}} south from these ticks. This gets you your next set of range lines. You will note there is an offset between the range lines extending north from the lower base line and those extending south from the current ones. This offset occurs along what is called a correction line.

Repeat the base line process every {{convert|24.1500|mi|km}} northwards (to the 32nd).

All this will result in a mesh of cells nominally six miles (plus 3 or 6 [[chain (unit)|chain]]s for road allowances) on a side. Each such cell is called a township (not to be confused with the township lines laid off earlier). Subdivide the township into 36 sections by laying off ticks of one-sixth of each township side and connecting them by north-south and east-west lines. The sections are numbered [[sinusoidally]] starting from the southeast corner of the township.

Sections can be similarly subdivided into quarters by placing and connecting ticks at the halfway point on each section side. Use the same process to subdivide sections into legal [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] (LSD) except place the tick at the one-quarter waypoints. LSDs are numbered sinusoidally starting at the southeast corner of the section.

While the ATS format is still [[Property|proprietary]], online conversion tools have been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1113">The '''Brussels Geographic Conference''' was held in [[Brussels]] [[Belgium]] in September 1876 at the request of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. At the conference were invited nearly forty well-known experts, mainly they were schooled in the geographic sciences or were wealthy [[philanthropist]]s. Before the guests returned to their respective countries, they voted to establish the [[International African Association]]. This initiative would in the end pave the way for the creation of [[Congo Free State]].

__NOTOC__
[[File:Monument Valley, late afternoon.jpg|thumb|[[West and East Mitten Buttes|The Mittens]] and [[Merrick Butte]] in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]]]]

In [[geomorphology]], a '''butte''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|t}}) is an isolated [[hill]] with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller [[landform]]s than [[mesa]]s, [[plateau]]s, and [[Table (landform)|tablelands]]. The word "butte" comes from a [[French language|French]] word meaning "small hill"; its use is prevalent in the [[Western United States]], including the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] where "mesa" is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the [[rule of thumb]] that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mesa and Butte | work=Science Clarified | year=2008 | url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230831/http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable buttes==
The [[West and East Mitten Buttes|Mitten Buttes]] of [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many  [[Western (genre)|western-themed]] [[film]]s, including seven movies directed by [[John Ford]].{{refn|name=note1|group=note|The John Ford westerns with location work shot in Monument Valley were ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964).}} The [[Devils Tower]] in northeastern [[Wyoming]] is a [[laccolith]]ic butte composed of [[igneous rock]] rather than [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or other [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Devils Tower National Monument - Geologic Formations | url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm | publisher=National Park Service | date=10 Mar 2014 | accessdate=13 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B D - Devil's Tower select (3) 1.1 (by).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]]]]

Three other notable formations that are either named ''butte'' or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]] in [[Nebraska]] which is actually a collection of five bluffs, [[Crested Butte]] which is a {{convert|12168|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain in [[Colorado]], and [[Elephant Butte Dam|Elephant Butte]] which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in [[New Mexico]].

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are [[Bear Butte]], [[South Dakota]], [[Black Butte (Oregon)|Black Butte]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Sutter Buttes]] in [[California]]. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word ''butte'', for example, [[Courthouse Rock]], Nebraska.  Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word ''butte'', examples of which are [[Kamiak Butte]] and Chelan Butte in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].

==Formation==
Buttes form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] when hard [[caprock]] overlies a layer of less resistant [[rock (geology)|rock]] that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the [[scree]] or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Davis, George Herbert|year=1999|title=Structural Geology of the Colorado Plateau Region of Southern Utah, with Special Emphasis on Deformation Bands|series=G.S.A.

[[File:Marine sextant.svg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram of a nautical [[sextant]], a tool used in celestial navigation]]

'''Celestial navigation''', also known as '''astronavigation''', is the ancient and modern practice of [[position fixing]] that enables a navigator to transition through a space without having to rely on estimated calculations, or [[dead reckoning]], to know their position. Celestial [[navigation]] uses "sights", or angular measurements taken between a [[celestial body]] (e.g. the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], a [[planet]], or a [[star]]) and the visible [[horizon]]. The Sun is most commonly used, but navigators can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] whose coordinates are tabulated in the [[nautical almanac]] and air [[almanac]]s.

Celestial navigation is the use of angular measurements (sights) between celestial bodies and the visible horizon to locate one's position in the [[Earth|world]], on land as well as at sea. At a given time, any celestial body is located directly over one point on the Earth's surface. The [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of that point is known as the celestial body's [[apparent place|geographic position]] (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the nautical or air almanac for that year.

The measured angle between the celestial body and the visible horizon is directly related to the distance between the celestial body's GP and the observer's position. After some computations, referred to as [[sight reduction]], this measurement is used to plot a [[position line|line of position]] (LOP) on a [[nautical chart|navigational chart]] or plotting work sheet, the observer's position being somewhere on that line. (The LOP is actually a short [[radius|segment]] of a very large circle on Earth that surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on Earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer's position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at [[Celestial navigation#Example|example]] below).  Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimizes the chance of error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, referred to as the 'altitude-intercept method'.

There are several other methods of celestial navigation that will also provide position-finding using [[sextant]] observations, such as the noon sight, and the more archaic [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]]. [[Joshua Slocum]] used the lunar distance method during the first recorded single-handed circumnavigation of the world. Unlike the altitude-intercept method, the noon sight and lunar distance methods do not require accurate knowledge of time. The altitude-intercept method of celestial navigation requires that the observer know exact Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at the moment of his observation of the celestial body, to the second—since for every four seconds that the time source (commonly a chronometer or, in aircraft, an accurate "[[hack watch]]") is in error, the position will be off by approximately one nautical mile.

==Example==
[[Image:Sun Moon (annotated).gif|right|thumb|300px]]
An example illustrating the concept behind the [[intercept method]] for determining one’s position is shown to the right. (Two other common methods for determining one’s position using celestial navigation are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and [[ex-meridian]] methods.) In the adjacent image, the two circles on the map represent lines of position for the Sun and Moon at 1200 [[GMT]] on October 29, 2005. At this time, a navigator on a ship at sea measured the Moon to be 56 degrees above the horizon using a [[sextant]]. Ten minutes later, the Sun was observed to be 40 degrees above the horizon. Lines of position were then calculated and plotted for each of these observations. Since both the Sun and Moon were observed at their respective angles from the same location, the navigator would have to be located at one of the two locations where the circles cross.

In this case the navigator is either located on the Atlantic Ocean, about {{convert|350|nmi|km}} west of Madeira, or in South America, about {{convert|90|nmi|km}} southwest of Asunción, Paraguay. In most cases, determining which of the two intersections is the correct one is obvious to the observer because they are often thousands of miles apart. As it is unlikely that the ship is sailing across South America, the position in the Atlantic is the correct one. Note that the lines of position in the figure are distorted because of the map’s projection; they would be circular if plotted on a globe.

An observer in the [[Gran Chaco]] point would see the Moon at the left of the Sun, and an observer in the Madeira point would see the  Moon at the right of the Sun.

==Angular measurement==
[[Image:Using sextant swing.gif|thumb|right|300px|Using a marine sextant to measure the altitude of the sun above the horizon]]
Accurate angle measurement evolved over the years. One simple method is to hold the hand above the horizon with one's arm stretched out. The width of the little finger is an angle just over 1.5 degrees elevation at extended arm's length and can be used to estimate the elevation of the sun from the horizon plane and therefore estimate the time until sunset. The need for more accurate measurements led to the development of a number of increasingly accurate instruments, including the [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], [[Mariner's astrolabe|astrolabe]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]]. The sextant and octant are most accurate because they measure angles from the horizon, eliminating errors caused by the placement of an instrument's pointers, and because their dual mirror system cancels relative motions of the instrument, showing a steady view of the object and horizon.

Navigators measure distance on the globe in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[arcminute]]s and [[arcsecond]]s. A [[nautical mile]] is defined as 1852 meters, but is also (not accidentally) one minute of angle along a meridian on the Earth. Sextants can be read accurately to within 0.2 arcminutes, so the observer's position can be determined within (theoretically) 0.2 miles, about 400 yards (370 m). Most ocean navigators, shooting from a moving platform, can achieve a practical accuracy of 1.5 miles (2.8&amp;nbsp;km), enough to navigate safely when out of sight of land.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Practical navigation==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

Practical celestial navigation usually requires a [[marine chronometer]] to measure time, a [[sextant]] to measure the angles, an [[Nautical almanac|almanac]] giving schedules of the coordinates of celestial objects, a set of sight reduction tables to help perform the height and [[azimuth]] computations, and a chart of the region. [[File:Two ship's officers 'shoot' in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Two nautical ship officers "shoot" in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude]]&lt;/small&gt; With sight reduction tables, the only calculations required are addition and subtraction. Small handheld computers, laptops and even scientific calculators enable modern navigators to "reduce" sextant sights in minutes, by automating all the calculation and/or data lookup steps. Most people can master simpler celestial navigation procedures after a day or two of instruction and practice, even using manual calculation methods.

Modern practical navigators usually use celestial navigation in combination with [[satellite navigation]] to correct a [[dead reckoning]] track, that is, a course estimated from a vessel's position, course and speed. Using multiple methods helps the navigator detect errors, and simplifies procedures. When used this way, a navigator will from time to time measure the sun's altitude with a sextant, then compare that with a precalculated altitude based on the exact time and estimated position of the observation. On the chart, one will use the straight edge of a plotter to mark each position line. If the position line indicates a location more than a few miles from the estimated position, more observations can be taken to restart the dead-reckoning track.

In the event of equipment or electrical failure, taking sun lines a few times a day and advancing them by dead reckoning allows a vessel to get a crude running fix sufficient to return to port. One can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] to track celestial positioning.

===Latitude===
[[Latitude]] was measured in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of [[Polaris]], the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which it is not in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the [[celestial north pole]]. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the [[zenith]], is not normally possible. When haze obscures the horizon, navigators use artificial horizons, which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.

===Longitude===
[[Longitude]] can be measured in the same way. If the angle to Polaris can be accurately measured, a similar measurement to a star near the eastern or western horizons will provide the longitude. The problem is that the Earth turns 15 degrees per hour, making such measurements dependent on time. A measure a few minutes before or after the same measure the day before creates serious navigation errors. Before good [[marine chronometer|chronometers]] were available, longitude measurements were based on the transit of the moon, or the positions of the moons of Jupiter. For the most part, these were too difficult to be used by anyone except professional astronomers. The invention of the modern chronometer by [[John Harrison]] in 1761 vastly simplified longitudinal calculation.

The longitude problem took centuries to solve and was dependent on the construction of a non-pendulum clock (as pendulum clocks cannot function accurately on a tilting ship, or indeed a moving vehicle of any kind). Two useful methods evolved during the 18th century and are still practised today: [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]], which does not involve the use of a chronometer, and use of an accurate timepiece or chronometer.

Presently, lay-person calculations of longitude can be made by noting the exact local time (leaving out any reference for Daylight Saving Time) when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.  The calculation of noon can be made more easily and accurately with a small, exactly vertical rod driven into level ground—take the time reading when the shadow is pointing due north (in the northern hemisphere).  Then take your local time reading and subtract it from GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]) or the time in London, England.  For example, a noon reading (1200 hours) near central Canada or the US would occur at approximately 6 pm (1800 hours) in London.  The six-hour differential is one quarter of a 24-hour day, or 90 degrees of a 360-degree circle (the Earth).  The calculation can also be made by taking the number of hours (use decimals for fractions of an hour) multiplied by 15, the number of degrees in one hour.  Either way, it can be demonstrated that much of central North America is at or near 90 degrees west longitude.  Eastern longitudes can be determined by adding the local time to GMT, with similar calculations.

====Lunar distance====
{{Main|lunar distance (navigation)|l1=Lunar distance}}
The older method, called "'''lunar distances'''", was refined in the 18th century and employed with decreasing regularity at sea through the middle of the 19th century. It is only used today by sextant hobbyists and historians, but the method is theoretically sound, and can be used when a timepiece is not available or its accuracy is suspect during a long sea voyage. The navigator precisely measures the angle between the moon and the sun, or between the moon and one of several stars near the [[ecliptic]]. The observed angle must be corrected for the effects of refraction and parallax, like any celestial sight. To make this correction the navigator would measure the altitudes of the moon and sun (or star) at about the same time as the lunar distance angle. Only rough values for the altitudes were required. Then a calculation with logarithms or graphical tables requiring ten to fifteen minutes' work would convert the observed angle to a geocentric lunar distance. The navigator would compare the corrected angle against those listed in the almanac for every three hours of Greenwich time, and interpolate between those values to get the actual Greenwich time aboard ship. Knowing Greenwich time and comparing against local time from a common altitude sight, the navigator can work out his longitude.

====Use of time====
{{Main|Marine chronometer#Today|l1= Marine chronometer Today}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The considerably more popular method was (and still is) to use an accurate timepiece to directly measure the time of a sextant sight. The need for accurate navigation led to the development of progressively more accurate chronometers in the 18th century (see [[John Harrison]]). Today, time is measured with a chronometer, a [[quartz clock|quartz watch]], a [[Time signal#Radio time signals|shortwave radio time signal]] broadcast from an [[atomic clock]], or the time displayed on a [[GPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|title=How accurate is the TIME DISPLAY on my GPS?|first=Joe|last=Mehaffey|date=|website=gpsinformation.net|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804120341/http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Watch#Electronic movements|quartz wristwatch]] normally keeps time within a half-second per day. If it is worn constantly, keeping it near body heat, its rate of drift can be measured with the radio and, by compensating for this drift, a navigator can keep time to better than a second per month. Traditionally, a navigator checked his chronometer from his sextant, at a geographic marker surveyed by a professional astronomer. This is now a rare skill, and most [[harbourmaster]]s cannot locate their harbour's marker.

Traditionally, three chronometers were kept in [[gimbals]] in a dry room near the centre of the ship. They were used to set a [[hack watch]] for the actual sight, so that no chronometers were ever exposed to the wind and salt water on deck. Winding and comparing the chronometers was a crucial duty of the navigator. Even today, it is still logged daily in the ship's deck log and reported to the Captain before [[Ship's bell|eight bells]] on the forenoon watch (shipboard noon). Navigators also set the ship's clocks and calendar.

==Modern celestial navigation==
The celestial line of position concept was discovered in 1837 by [[Thomas Hubbard Sumner]] when, after one observation, he computed and plotted his longitude at more than one trial latitude in his vicinity – and noticed that the positions lay along a line. Using this method with two bodies, navigators were finally able to cross two position lines and obtain their position – in effect determining both latitude and longitude. Later in the 19th century came the development of the modern (Marcq St. Hilaire) [[intercept method]]; with this method the body height and azimuth are calculated for a convenient trial position, and compared with the observed height. The difference in arcminutes is the nautical mile "intercept" distance that the position line needs to be shifted toward or away from the direction of the body's subpoint. (The intercept method uses the concept illustrated in the example in the “How it works” section above.) Two other methods of reducing sights are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and the [[ex-meridian]] method.

While celestial navigation is becoming increasingly redundant with the advent of inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers ([[GPS]]), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s, and [[marine navigation]] until quite recently. However; since a prudent mariner never relies on any sole means of fixing his position, many national maritime authorities still require deck officers to show knowledge of celestial navigation in examinations, primarily as a backup for electronic/satellite navigation. One of the most common current usages of celestial navigation aboard large merchant vessels is for compass calibration and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.

The [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[U.S. Navy]] continued instructing military aviators on celestial navigation use until 1997, because:
* celestial navigation can be used independently of ground aids
* celestial navigation has global coverage
* celestial navigation can not be jammed (although it can be obscured by clouds)
* celestial navigation does not give off any signals that could be detected by an enemy &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Air Force]] Pamphlet (AFPAM) 11-216, Chapters 8–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Naval Academy]] announced that it was discontinuing its course on celestial navigation (considered to be one of its most demanding non-engineering courses) from the formal curriculum in the spring of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EED61038F93AA15756C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fU%2fUnited%20States%20Naval%20Academy Navy Cadets Won't Discard Their Sextants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213125009/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EED61038F93AA15756C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FU%2FUnited%20States%20Naval%20Academy |date=2009-02-13 }}, [[The New York Times]] By DAVID W.

At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam to enter the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]]. It is also taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], most recently as Astronomy 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation – ''Astronomy 2 Celestial Navigation'' by Philip Sadler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121834/http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation |date=2015-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial navigation continues to be used by private yachtsmen, and particularly by long-distance cruising yachts around the world. For small cruising boat crews, celestial navigation is generally considered an essential skill when venturing beyond visual range of land. Although GPS (Global Positioning System) technology is reliable, offshore yachtsmen use celestial navigation as either a primary navigational tool or as a backup.

Celestial navigation was used in commercial aviation up until the early part of the jet age; early [[Boeing 747]]s had a "sextant port" in the roof of the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=The future of flying|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=19 April 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614034443/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|archivedate=14 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only phased out in the 1960s with the advent of [[inertial navigation]] and doppler navigation systems, and today's satellite-based systems which can locate the aircraft's position accurate to a 3-meter sphere with several updates per second.

A variation on terrestrial celestial navigation was used to help orient the [[Apollo spacecraft]] en route to and from the Moon. To this day, space missions such as the [[Mars Exploration Rover#Cruise stage navigation components|Mars Exploration Rover]] use [[star tracker]]s to determine the [[Attitude control (spacecraft)|attitude]] of the spacecraft.

As early as the mid-1960s, advanced electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The [[SR-71]] high-speed [[reconnaissance aircraft]] was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of [[Astro-inertial navigation system|automated celestial and inertial navigation]]. These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.

[[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s use celestial navigation to check and correct their course (initially set using internal gyroscopes) while flying outside the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. The immunity to jamming signals is the main driver behind this seemingly archaic technique.

[[X-ray pulsar-based navigation|X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing]] (XNAV) is an experimental navigation technique whereby the periodic [[X-ray]] signals emitted from [[X-ray pulsar|pulsars]] are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. Similar to GPS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to triangulate its position accurately (±5&amp;nbsp;km). The advantage of using X-ray signals over [[radio waves]] is that [[X-ray telescopes]] can be made smaller and lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |title=Pulsars map the way for space missions |date=4 June 2014 |first=Tushna |last=Commissariat |publisher=[[Physics World]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018145025/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |archivedate=18 October 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/515321/an-interplanetary-gps-using-pulsar-signals |title=An Interplanetary GPS Using Pulsar Signals|date=23 May 2013 |publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Werner |last2=Bernhardt |first2=Mike G. |last3=Jessner |first3=Axel |arxiv=1305.4842 |title=Autonomous Spacecraft Navigation With Pulsars |date=2013-05-21 |doi=10.2420/AF07.2013.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 2016 the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] launched an experimental pulsar navigation satellite called [[XPNAV 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |title=XPNAV 1 |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101165228/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |archivedate=2016-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|title=Chinese Long March 11 launches first Pulsar Navigation Satellite into Orbit|date=10 November 2016|publisher=Spaceflight101.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824052232/http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEXTANT (Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology) is a [[NASA]]-funded project developed at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] that is testing XNAV on-orbit on board the [[International Space Station]] in connection with the [[Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer|NICER]] project, launched on 3 June 2017 on the [[SpaceX CRS-11]] ISS resupply mission.&lt;ref name="nasa-nicer-manifest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |title=NICER Manifested on SpaceX-11 ISS Resupply Flight |series=NICER News |publisher=NASA |date=December 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2017 |quote=Previously scheduled for a December 2016 launch on SpaceX-12, NICER will now fly to the International Space Station with two other payloads on SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-11, in the Dragon vehicle's unpressurized Trunk. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324025933/https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial navigation trainer==
Celestial navigation trainers for aircraft crews combine a simple [[flight simulator]] with a [[planetarium]].

An early example is the [[Link Trainer|Link Celestial Navigation Trainer]], used in the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II|work=A Brief History of Aircraft Flight Simulation|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209093839/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|archivedate=December 9, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporal Tomisita "Tommye" Flemming-Kelly-U.S.M.C.-Celestial Navigation Trainer −1943/45|work=World War II Memories|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119104703/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|archivedate=2005-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in a {{convert|45|ft|m}} high building, it featured a [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] accommodating a whole [[bomber]] crew (pilot, navigator and bombardier). The cockpit offered a full array of [[measuring instrument|instruments]] which the [[aviator|pilot]] used to fly the simulated aeroplane. Fixed to a [[Astrodome (aviation)|dome]] above the cockpit was an arrangement of lights, some [[collimated]], simulating [[constellation]]s from which the navigator determined the plane's position. The dome's movement simulated the changing positions of the stars with the passage of time and the movement of the plane around the earth. The navigator also received simulated radio signals from various positions on the ground. Below the cockpit moved "terrain plates" – large, movable aerial photographs of the land below – which gave the crew the impression of flight and enabled the bomber to practise lining up bombing targets. A team of operators sat at a control booth on the ground below the machine, from which they could simulate [[weather]] conditions such as wind or cloud. This team also tracked the aeroplane's position by moving a "crab" (a marker) on a paper map.

The Link Celestial Navigation Trainer was developed in response to a request made by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1939. The RAF ordered 60 of these machines, and the first one was built in 1941. The RAF used only a few of these, leasing the rest back to the US, where eventually hundreds were in use.

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Khan (1968)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somigliana equation===
The above expression for ''g'' has been supplanted by the Somigliana equation (after [[Carlo Somigliana]]):

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi) = G_e \left[ \frac{1+k\sin^2 \varphi}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \sin^2 \varphi }} \right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Deep-sea exploration''' is the investigation of physical, [[chemical]], and [[biological]] conditions on the [[sea bed]], for [[scientific]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes. Deep-sea [[exploration]] is considered as a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of [[geophysical]] research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain as a largely unexplored part of the [[Earth|planet]], and form a relatively undiscovered domain.

In general, modern scientific [[Deep sea|Deep-sea]] exploration can be said to have begun when [[France|French]] scientist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] investigated the average depth of the [[Atlantic ocean]] by observing tidal motions registered on [[Brazil]]ian and [[Africa]]n coasts. He calculated the depth to be {{convert|3,962|m|ft|0}}, a value later proven quite accurate by soundings measurement.&lt;ref name="enotes2003"&gt;Deep Sea Exploration." World of Earth Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. Gale Cengage, 2003. eNotes.com. 2006. 7 Dec, 2009 &lt;http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/deep-sea-exploration&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, with increasing demand for [[submarine cable]]s installment, accurate soundings was required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken. First deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when [[Norway|Norwegian]] researchers obtained a sample of a stalked [[crinoid]] at a depth of {{convert|3,109|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The [[British Government]] sent out the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] (a ship called {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}}) in 1872 which discovered 715 new [[genera]] and 4,417 new [[species]] of marine organisms over the space of four years.&lt;ref name="enotes2003"/&gt;

The first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight, used by British explorer [[Sir James Clark Ross]].&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..de026100.a#FWNE.fw..de026100.a ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501194025/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..de026100.a#FWNE.fw..de026100.a |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this instrument, he reached a depth of {{convert|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207274 |title=DEEP-SEA EXPLORATION (2009) |publisher=History.com |accessdate=8 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209114759/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207274 |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Challenger'' expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7094/Underwater-Exploration-Oceanography.html|title=Underwater Exploration - Oceanography|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS ''Challenger'', a sailing vessel that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The ''Challenger'' expedition covered {{convert|127,653|km|nmi}}, and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples, hydrographic measurements, and specimens of marine life. They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins. They discovered more than 4,700 new species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html |title=A Brief History |publisher=Ceoe.udel.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005020142/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html |archivedate=2010-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep-sea exploration advanced considerably in the 1900s thanks to a series of technological inventions, ranging from [[sonar]] system to detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound to manned deep-diving submersibles such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}}. Operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], ''Alvin'' is designed to carry a crew of three people to depths of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The submarine is equipped with lights, cameras, computers, and highly maneuverable robotic arms for collecting samples in the darkness of the ocean's depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8422 |title=Human Occupied Vehicle Alvin : Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |publisher=Whoi.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the voyage to the ocean bottom is still a challenging experience. Scientists are working to find ways to study this extreme environment from the shipboard. With more sophisticated use of [[fiber optics]], [[satellite]]s, and remote-control robots, scientists one day may explore the deep sea from a computer screen on the deck rather than out of a porthole.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Milestones of deep sea exploration ==
The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies, which has been the main reason why its exploration has a comparatively short history.
In the following, important key stones of deep sea exploration are listed.

*1521: [[Ferdinand Magellan]] tried to measure the depth of the Pacific Ocean with a weighted line, but did not find bottom.
*1818: The British researcher [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching [[jellyfish]] and [[worm]]s in about {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} depth with a special device. 
*1843: Nevertheless, [[Edward Forbes]] claimed that diversity of life in the deep sea is little and decreases with increasing depth. He stated that there could be no life in waters deeper than {{convert|550|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, the so-called [[Abyssus theory]].
*1850: Near the [[Lofoten]], [[Michael Sars]] found a rich deep sea fauna in a depth of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} thereby refuting the Abyssus Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Darmstaedter (Hrsg.): ''[http://www.digitalis.uni-koeln.de/Darmstaedter/darmstaedter_index.html Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik]'', Springer, Berlin 1908, S. 521&lt;/ref&gt;
*1872–1876: The first systematic deep sea exploration was conducted by the [[Challenger Expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] on board the ship {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} led by [[Charles Wyville Thomson]]. This expedition revealed that the deep sea harbours a diverse, specialized biota.
*1890–1898: First Austrian-Hungarian deep sea expedition on board the ship {{SMS|Pola}} led by [[Franz Steindachner]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]].
*1898–1899: First German deep sea expedition on board the ship ''Valdivia'' led by [[Carl Chun]]; found many new species from depths greater than {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
*1930: [[William Beebe]] and [[Otis Barton]] are the first humans to reach the Deep Sea when diving in the so-called [[Bathysphere]], made from steel. They reach a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, where they observed jellyfish and [[shrimp]].
*1934: The Bathysphere reached a depth of {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1948: [[Otis Barton]] set out for a new record reaching a depth of {{convert|1370|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1960: [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]] reached the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], descending to a depth of {{convert|10,740|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in their deep sea vessel {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, where they observed fish and other deep sea organisms.
*2012: The vessel {{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}, piloted by [[James Cameron]], completes the second manned voyage and first solo mission to the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]].

==Oceanographic instrumentation&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;==
[[File:PSM V76 D201 Deep sea exploration apparatus.png|thumbnail|Deep sea exploration apparatus,1910]]
The sounding weight, one of the first instruments used for the sea bottom investigation, was designed as a tube on the base which forced the seabed in when it hit the bottom of the ocean. British explorer Sir [[James Clark Ross]] fully employed this instrument to reach a depth of {{convert|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1840.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Deep-Sea Exploration: Earth's Final Frontier Only a Portion of the Potential of the Oceans Has Been Tapped, but It Is Clear That Exploring and Improving Our Understanding of the Ocean and Its Influence on Global Events Are among Our Most Important Challenges Today Journal article by Stephen L. Baird; The Technology Teacher, Vol. 65, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sounding weights used on {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} were slightly advanced called "Baillie sounding machine". The British researchers used wire-line soundings to investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all the oceans except the [[Arctic]]. Also used on HMS ''Challenger'' were dredges and scoops, suspended on ropes, with which samples of the sediment and biological specimens of the seabed could be obtained.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

A more advanced version of the sounding weight is the gravity corer. The gravity corer allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers at the bottom of oceans. The corer consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the corer from its suspension cable when the corer is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The corer falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. By lifting the corer, a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed’s layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see the presence or absence of specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a corer mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel [[JOIDES Resolution]] is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as {{convert|1,500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} below the ocean bottom. (See [[Ocean Drilling Program]])&lt;ref name="ecnext1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/5246/article-1G1-140513262/deepsea-exploration-earth-final-frontier-only-portion |title=Deep-sea exploration: Earth's final frontier: only a portion of the potential of the oceans has been tapped, but it is clear that exploring and improving our understanding of the ocean and its influence on global events are among our most important challenges today. &amp;#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=1079 |title=WHOI : Instruments : Gravity Corer |publisher=Whoi.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echo-sounding instruments have also been widely used to determine the depth of the sea bottom since [[World War II]]. This instrument is used primarily for determining the depth of water by means of an acoustic echo. A pulse of sound sent from the ship is reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship, the interval of time between transmission and reception being proportional to the depth of the water. By registering the time lapses between outgoing and returning signals continuously on paper tape, a continuous mapping of the seabed is obtained. The majority of the ocean floor has been mapped in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/echo-sounder |title=echo sounder: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, high-resolution television cameras, [[thermometer]]s, pressure meters, and [[seismograph]]s are other notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered to the sea bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible [[buoy]]s. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic sound device so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as [[satellite]] navigation systems, and [[global positioning system]]s that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon on the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

==Oceanographic submersibles==
Because of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded made by a skin diver is {{convert|127|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the "[[JIM suit]]," allows divers to reach depths up to approximately {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Communications and Marketing |url=http://www.expeditions.udel.edu/extreme08/tools/discovery.php |title=Depths of Discovery |publisher=Expeditions.udel.edu |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional suits feature [[Marine propulsion|thruster]] packs that boost a diver to different locations underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093811/http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explore even deeper depths, deep-sea explorers must rely on specially constructed steel chambers to protect them. The American explorer [[William Beebe]], also a naturalist from [[Columbia University]] in New York, was the designer of the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths that could not be reached by a diver.&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7100/Underwater-Exploration.html |title=Underwater Exploration - History, Oceanography, Instrumentation, Diving Tools And Techniques, Deep-sea Submersible Vessels, Key Findings In Underwater Exploration - Deep-sea pioneers |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1960-01-23 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bathysphere]], a spherical steel vessel, was designed by Beebe and his fellow engineer [[Otis Barton]], an engineer at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/769/Bathysphere.html |title=Bathysphere - Air, Sea, Exploration, Diving, Bell, and Scientists |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1930-06-06 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}},  and {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productivitydevelopment.com/26%20Deep%20Sea%20Explore.pdf|title=Deep Sea Explore|publisher=Productivitydevelopment.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard]] tested a much deeper-diving vessel he invented called the [[bathyscaphe]], a navigable deep-sea vessel with its gasoline-filled float and suspended chamber or gondola of spherical steel.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; On an experimental dive in the [[Cape Verde Islands]], his bathyscaphe successfully withstood the pressure on it at {{convert|1,402|m|abbr=on|0}}, but its body was severely damaged by heavy waves after the dive. In 1954, with this bathyscaphe, Piccard reached a depth of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; In 1953, his son [[Jacques Piccard]] joined in building new and improved bathyscaphe {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, which dived to {{convert|3,139|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}  in field trials.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; The [[United States Navy]] acquired ''Trieste'' in 1958 and equipped it with a new cabin to enable it to reach deep ocean trenches.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in ''Trieste'' to the deepest known point on Earth - the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], successfully making the deepest dive in history: {{convert|10,915|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;
 
An increasing number of occupied submersibles are now employed around the world. The American-built {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} that is operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], is a three-person submarine that can dive to about {{convert|3,600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} and is equipped with a mechanical manipulator to collect bottom samples.&lt;ref name="sciencebase1"&gt;{{cite web|author=TechTalk |url=http://www.sciencebase.com/deep_sea_exploration.html |title=Deep sea exploration and marine science aboard Alvin et al - 11/04 |publisher=Sciencebase.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alvin'' made its first test dive in 1964, and has performed more than 3,000 dives to average depths of {{convert|1,829|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. ''Alvin'' has also involved in a wide variety of research projects, such as one where [[giant tube worm]]s were discovered on the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor near the [[Galápagos Islands]].&lt;ref name="sciencebase1"/&gt;

===Unmanned submersibles===
[[File:Autonomous landers, Observing the deepest places on Earth.WebM|thumb|left|240px|Describing the operation and use of autonomous landers in deep sea research.]]
One of the first unmanned deep sea vehicles was developed by the University of California with a grant from the Allan Hancock Foundation in the early 1950s to develop a more economical method of taking photos miles under the sea with an unmanned steel high-pressure {{convert|3,000|lb|abbr=on|0}} sphere called a '''benthograph''' which contained a camera and strobe light.  The original benthograph built by USC was very successful in taking a series of underwater photos until it became wedged between some rocks and could not be retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Deep Sea Photographers."] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1953, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

ROVs, or [[remote operated vehicle]]s, are seeing increasing use in underwater exploration. These submersibles are piloted through a cable which connects to the surface ship, and they can reach depths of up to {{convert|6,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. New developments in robotics have also led to the creation of AUVs, or [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s. The robotic submarines are programmed in advance, and receive no instruction from the surface. HROV combine features of both ROVs and AUV, operating independently or with a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-science/deep-ocean-exploration/tools-and-technology/|title=The Deep Sea|author=The Ocean Portal Team|date=24 July 2012|work=Smithsonian Ocean Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enchantedlearning1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/b/ballard.shtml |title=Robert Ballard: Undersea Explorers |publisher=EnchantedLearning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ship||Argo|ROV|2}} was employed in 1985 to locate the wreck of {{RMS|Titanic}}; the smaller {{ship||Jason|ROV|2}} was also used to explore the shipwreck.&lt;ref name="enchantedlearning1"/&gt;

==Scientific results==
In 1974, ''Alvin'' (operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe ''[[Archimède]]'', and the French diving saucer ''Cyane'', assisted by support ships and {{ship||Glomar Challenger}}, explored the great rift valley of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], southwest of the [[Azores]]. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified [[magma]] were found on each side of the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1}} per year (see [[plate tectonics]],).&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;[http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208003634/http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration |date=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of dives conducted between 1979–1980 into the [[Galápagos]] [[rift]], off the coast of [[Ecuador]], French, Italian, Mexican, and U.S. scientists found vents, nearly {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} high and about {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} across, discharging a mixture of hot water (up to {{convert|300|C|F|disp=comma}}) and dissolved metals in dark, smoke-like plumes (see [[hydrothermal vent]],). These hot springs play an important role in the formation of deposits that are enriched in [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridasmart.com/subjects/ocean/deepsea.htm |title=Deep Sea Exploration: Submarine Volcanoes and Hydrothermal Vents |publisher=Floridasmart.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215223336/http://www.floridasmart.com/subjects/ocean/deepsea.htm |archivedate=2011-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19705">'''The exploration of [[North America]]''' by non-indigenous people was a continuing effort to map and explore the continent of North America. It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The [[European colonization of the Americas]] followed.

{{main|Norse colonization of the Americas}}{{See also|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
According to the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors (often called [[Vikings]]) from [[Iceland]] first settled [[Greenland]] in the 980s. [[Erik the Red]] explored and settled southwestern [[Greenland]], which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern]] and [[Western Settlement]]s, which were abandoned around 1350.

[[L'Anse aux Meadows]], an [[archaeological site]] on the northernmost tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of [[Vinland]] established by [[Leif Erikson]] in 1003.

==Age of Discovery and the search for the Northwest Passage==
{{clear}}{{euromericas}}{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}
The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the [[Old World]], and Europeans remained unaware of the existence of the [[Americas]] as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] to East Asia (or "the Indies" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the [[Silk Road]], a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Also, the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]] needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.

[[File:The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492.jpg|thumb|The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492]]
On August 3, 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the [[Province of Huelva]], from the newly ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Católicos]]'' coordinated Kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], in present-day [[Spain]], financed by Queen [[Isabella I of Castille]].  [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage]] of his discovery of the [[Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], and [[Hispaniola]] spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in his second voyage then discovered both [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern [[South America]]n coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the [[Central American]] coast. The [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] opened the [[New World]].

Italian navigator and explorer [[Giovanni Caboto]] (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]]. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|Juan de la Cosa's map]] of 1500.

In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they reached [[Greenland]] and sighted [[Labrador]] for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming "''Terra Verde''" the explored North American coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations were signaled in 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a [[New World]], which in 1507 was named "America", probably after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], on the [[Waldseemüller map]].

==Further nautical explorations==
In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was sent by [[Portugal]] to explore [[South America]]. He is considered to be the discoverer of [[Brazil]].

[[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] sent [[Juan Ponce de León]] from the fledgling colony on [[Hispaniola]] to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de León disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Ponce de León Inlet]], and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. He encountered the powerful [[Gulf Stream]] and found a passage through the [[Florida Keys]] to land on the southwestern [[Gulf Coast]] of Florida on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Again, the exact location is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day [[United States]] mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1513, Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] was the first European to see the [[Pacific Ocean]] once he crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of [[The Californias|Las Californias]].

Around 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer [[João Álvares Fagundes]] explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and [[Nova Scotia]], with a mission to create colonies.

In 1524, Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed for King [[Francis I of France]] and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the [[Cape Fear River]] delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]], entering the [[Pamlico Sound]], and bypassing entrances to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Believing the [[New York Harbor]] to be a lake, he sailed past [[Long Island]], exploring [[Narragansett Bay]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

In 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer [[Estevão Gomes]], on behalf of [[Charles I of Spain]], explored present-day [[Nova Scotia]] sailing South along the [[Maine]] coast. Gomes entered [[New York Harbor]] and saw the [[Hudson River]](which he named the "San Antonio River"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]], on the Gulf [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the [[St. Lawrence river]] and also claimed the region for France.

[[File:Henry Hudson map.JPG|thumb|left|Map of Hudson's voyages to North America.]]
After two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating [[Siberia]], [[Henry Hudson]] sailed west in 1609 under the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He, too, passed [[Cape Cod]], Chesapeake Bay and the [[Delaware Bay]], instead sailing up the [[Hudson River]] on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the [[Great Lakes]]. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the [[Hudson Strait]], [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]].

Other major sea-based explorers were Captain [[James Cook]], [[George Vancouver]], and [[Charles Wilkes]].

==Overland exploration of the West==
{{mergefrom|16th century in North American history|date=September 2018}}
===16th to 17th centuries===
There were numerous Spanish explorers and [[conquistadors]] who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] and [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]], but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].

[[File:1814ThompsonMap.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the North-West Territory of the Province of Canada, stretching from the [[Fraser River]] on the west to [[Lake Superior]] on the east. By David Thompson, 1814.]]

In 1608 [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded what is now [[Quebec City]], which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of [[New France]]. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered [[Lake Champlain]] in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the [[Ottawa River]] through [[Lake Nipissing]] and [[Georgian Bay]] to the centre of [[Wyandot people|Huron]] country near [[Lake Simcoe]]. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.

From 1679 to 1682 [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] explored the [[Great Lakes]] region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and the entire course of [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

From 1697 to 1702 [[Eusebio Kino]] explored the [[Sonoran Desert]] and on his journey to the [[Colorado River Delta]] discovered an overland route to [[Baja California]] that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of [[Baja California]].

European exploration of [[western Canada]] was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive [[Northwest Passage]]. [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorer [[Henry Kelsey]] has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern [[Great Plains]] in 1690.

===18th century===

[[Anthony Henday]] was the first to have seen the [[Rocky Mountains]], in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of [[Olds, Alberta]], halfway between [[Calgary]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta]]) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. [[Samuel Hearne]] found the [[Coppermine River]] in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit  exploration.

The [[North West Company]], on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the [[Bella Coola River]], in 1793. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] reached the Pacific in 1808 via the [[Fraser River]].

[[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000&amp;nbsp;km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from [[Lake Superior]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the [[Jay Treaty]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of {{convert|6750|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Grand Portage]], through [[Lake Winnipeg]], to the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers, as well as two sides of [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref name="vanherk"&gt;Aritha Van Herk, ''Travels with Charlotte'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, the company sent him to [[Red Deer Lake (Alberta)|Red Deer Lake]] (in present-day [[Alberta]]) to establish a trading post. The English translation of [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac La Biche]]-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.&lt;ref name=AlbertaAtlas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|publisher=University of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta|title=Lac La Biche 2004-5|series=Atlas of Alberta Lakes|year=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003742/http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in [[Alberta]]), and during this time led several expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]]. In 1811/1812 he followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of [[western Canada]], covering 3.9 million square kilometres.

===19th century to present===
[[Lewis and Clark]] were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], at the order of President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. [[John Colter]] was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.

[[John C. Frémont]] led many important explorations in the [[Great Plains]], [[Great Basin]], [[History of Oregon|Oregon territory]], and Mexican [[Alta California]].

[[Joseph Reddeford Walker]] was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the [[Humboldt River]] across present-day [[Nevada]], ascending the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] following the [[Carson River]] and descending via [[Stanislaus River]] drainages to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. His return route across the southern Sierra was via [[Walker Pass]], named after Walker by [[John Charles Fremont]]. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the [[California Trail]], the primary route for the emigrants to the [[gold]] fields during the [[California gold rush]].

As the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the [[US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was [[George Wheeler (explorer)|George Wheeler]]. In 1872, the [[US Congress]] authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]] at a scale of 8&amp;nbsp;miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the [[Wheeler Survey]], along with the [[Clarence King]] and [[John Wesley Powell]] Surveys, and expeditions by [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]]. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the [[United States Geological Survey]].

[[File:SplitRockFogSignal.jpg|thumb|right|Building housing the two diaphone foghorns at [[Split Rock Light]].]]
A '''foghorn''' is a fog signal that uses sound to warn vehicles of navigational hazards like rocky coastlines, or boats of the presence of other vessels, in [[fog]]gy conditions. The term is most often used in relation to marine transport. When visual [[navigation]] aids such as [[lighthouse]]s are obscured, foghorns provide an audible warning of [[rock outcrop]]s, [[shoal]]s, [[headlands and bays|headlands]], or other dangers to shipping.

==Description==
All foghorns use a vibrating column of air to create an audible tone, but the method of setting up this vibration differs. Some horns, like the Daboll trumpet, used vibrating plates or metal [[reed (music)|reeds]], a similar principle to a modern electric [[Vehicle horn|car horn]]. Others used air forced through holes in a revolving cylinder or disk, in the same manner as a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]]. Semi-automatic operation of foghorns was achieved by using a [[clockwork]] mechanism (or "coder") to sequentially open the valves admitting air to the horns; each horn was given its own timing characteristics to help mariners identify them.&lt;ref name=ayre&gt;See for example Fox, F. [http://homepages.manx.net/fredd/siren.html Siren, Point of Ayre Lighthouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709040136/http://homepages.manx.net/fredd/siren.html |date=2008-07-09 }}, accessed 08-09-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early fog signals===
[[File:Fort point light station bell.jpg|thumb|right|An early form of fog signal. The fog bell at [[Fort Point Light Station]], [[Maine]].]]
Audible fog signals have been used in one form or another for hundreds of years, initially simply [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] or [[gong]]s struck manually.

At some [[lighthouse]]s, a small [[cannon]] was let off periodically to warn away ships, but this had the obvious disadvantage of having to be fired manually throughout the whole period the fog persisted (which could be for several days). Lighthouse windows and lighting apparatus were susceptible to damage depending on the proximity of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oke |first=Robert |date=15 May 1863|title= Letter to J. H. Warren Esq. Chairman, Board of Works (St. John’s); Letters by Robert Oke (1794-1870) |location= PANL GN 1/3/A file 1/1864 |publisher=The Rooms Archives (St. John’s, NL) }}&lt;/ref&gt; One incident of lax handling of explosives nearby resulted in a concussion that propelled the lighthouse keeper at [http://lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1312/ Fort Amherst], who was seated, to the other end of the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oke |first=Robert |date=5 Jan 1863|title= Letter to J. H. Warren Esq. Chairman Board of Works (St. John’s); Letters by Robert Oke (1794-1870) |location= PANL File 1/1864 |publisher=The Rooms Archives (St. John’s, NL) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[whistle]]s were also used where a source of steam power was available, though [[Trinity House]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[lighthouse authority]], did not employ them, preferring an explosive signal.

Throughout the 19th century efforts were made to automate the signalling process. Trinity House eventually developed a system (the "[[Signal, Fog, Mk I]]") for firing a [[nitrocellulose|gun-cotton]] charge electrically.  However, the charge had to be manually replaced after each signal. At [[Portland Bill]], for example, which had a five-minute interval between fog-signals, this meant the horns had to be lowered, the two new charges inserted, and the horns raised again every five minutes during foggy periods.
Clockwork systems were also developed for striking bells.&lt;ref name=pepper&gt;Pepper, T. ''[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/stevens/stevens.htm Stevens Fog Bell Apparatus]'', Seeing the Light&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[James William Newton]] claimed to have been the inventor of the fog signalling technique using loud and low notes.&lt;ref name=jesmond&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Jesmond Old Cemetery]] |url=http://www.jesmondoldcemetery.co.uk/newton_50.html |title=James William Newton |quote=[[James William Newton|Captain Newton]] also claimed to be the inventor of fog signalling by the interchange and repetition [sic] of loud and low notes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanization===
[[File:Foghorns.jpg|thumb|right|Foghorns near [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], [[Cornwall]]. This installation uses a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] to produce sound.]]
[[File:Foghorn building on Flat Holm Island.jpg|thumb|right|Another Trinity House fog siren installation on [[Flat Holm]], now restored by the Flat Holm Project]][[File:SumburgLighthouseFoghorn.jpg|thumb|right|Bearing mechanism of [[Sumburgh Head|Sumburgh]] lighthouse Foghorn ([[Shetland]])]]

The first [[Automation|automated]] [[steam]]-powered foghorn was invented by [[Robert Foulis (inventor)|Robert Foulis]], a Scotsman who emigrated to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada. Foulis is said to have heard his daughter playing the [[piano]] in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with it. Foulis repeatedly presented his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the [[Bay of Fundy]] for installation on [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]]. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis's plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission.  For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, [[T. T. Vernon Smith]], who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own.  The foghorn was constructed at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]] in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn.  After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor, but he never patented or profited from his invention.&lt;ref name=foulis&gt;[http://www.glasgowguide.co.uk/info-fame_Robert_Foulis_Jr.html Famous Glaswegians - Robert Foulis, JR], accessed 05-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of fog signal technology continued apace at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/diaphone/diaphone.htm Terry Pepper, ''Seeing the Light'', "Diaphones".]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period an inventor, [[Celadon Leeds Daboll]], developed a coal-powered foghorn called the [[Daboll trumpet]] for the American lighthouse service, though it was not universally adopted.&lt;ref name=holland&gt;Holland, F. R. ''America's Lighthouses'', Dover, 1988, {{ISBN|0-486-25576-X}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; A few Daboll trumpets remained in use until the mid-20th century.

In the [[United Kingdom]], experiments to develop more effective foghorns were carried out by [[John Tyndall]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]], amongst others. The latter's ongoing research for Trinity House culminated in a design for a siren with a large trumpet designed to achieve maximum sound propagation (see reference for details of the Trials of Fog Signals&lt;ref name="Renton 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renton|first=Alan|title=Lost Sounds: The Story of Coast Fog Signals|year=2001|publisher=Whittles Publishing|isbn=978-1870325837}}&lt;/ref&gt;), installed in [[Trevose Head Lighthouse]], [[Cornwall]] in 1913.

One of the first automated fog bells was the Stevens Automatic Bell Striker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/stevens/stevens.htm Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Stevens Automated Bell Striker.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later fog bells were placed under water, particularly in especially dangerous areas, so that their sound (which would be a predictable code, such as the number "23") would be carried further and reverberate through the ship's hull.  For example, this technique was used at [[White Shoal Light (Michigan)]].&lt;ref name = "National Geographic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first= George R. |date=January 1913 |title= Beacons of the Seas: Lighting the Coasts of the United States |journal=National Geographic Magazine |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |pages=19 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LNQKAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA19,M1 |accessdate=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/michigan/whiteshoal/whiteshoal.htm Terry Pepper, ''Seeing The Light'', White Shoal Light.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an earlier precursor to [[RACON]].

===Diaphone===
{{Main|Diaphone}}
From the early 20th century an improved device called the [[diaphone]], originally invented as an [[organ stop]] by [[Robert Hope-Jones]],&lt;ref name="Renton 1"/&gt; and developed as a fog signal by John Northey of [[Toronto]], became the standard foghorn apparatus for new installations.{{where|date=April 2015}} Diaphones were powered by [[compressed air]] and could emit extremely powerful low-frequency notes.

In 1982, the Dutch broadcaster [[VPRO]] aired a live foghorn concert on national radio, relaying the sound of the foghorns in [[Emden]], [[Calais]], [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], [[Scheveningen]], [[Den Helder]], [[Lelystad]], [[Urk]], [[Marken]] and [[Kornwerderzand]], mixed with studio music by sound artist [[Alvin Curran]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.vpro.nl/radioarchief/2010/07/22/ovt-serie-gouden-jaren-afl-4-bijzondere-experimenten/#more-4146], retrieved July 26, 2010.

[[File:Foghorn On Ailsa Craig.jpg|thumb|right|Foghorn on [[Ailsa Craig]], where the fog signal was discontinued in 1966.]]
Since automation of lighthouses became common in the 1960s and 1970s, most older foghorn installations have been removed to avoid the need to run the complex machinery associated with them, and have been replaced with electrically powered diaphragm or [[air horn|compressed air horn]]s. Activation is completely automated: a laser or photo beam is shot out to sea, and if the beam reflects back to the source (i.e. the laser beam is visible due to the fog), the sensor sends a signal to activate the foghorn. In many cases, modern navigational aids have rendered large, long-range foghorns completely unnecessary, according to the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]].&lt;ref name=iala&gt;Noble, D. L. ''Lighthouses and Keepers'', Naval Institute Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-59114-626-1}}, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railway fog signals==
{{Main|Detonator (railway)}}
Fog signals have also been used on railway lines since the middle of the 19th century to indicate to the driver of a moving train that a broken down train, a work party, or some other unforeseen hazard is on the line ahead. Small [[explosive]] [[detonator]]s or torpedoes are placed on the track, and detonated by the pressure of the wheels of the oncoming train.  The loud report of the explosion provides the indication to the driver, that in most cases requires the train to be stopped immediately. During [[World War II]], these devices were modified to detonate [[demolition charge]]s during railroad [[sabotage]] operations.

The '''GPS2SMS''' term describes the transfer of [[Geographic coordinate system|co-ordinates]] of an object or person by means of [[Short Message Service|SMS]] [[text messaging]]. For this, the following applications are suitable:
* [[Anti-theft system]] for vehicles and vessels (sound the alarm if it is transported) 
* [[Track and trace|tracking and tracing]] (tracking of an object, such as a shipping container) 
* [[Geo-fence|geofencing]] (sound the alarm if someone enters a prohibited area) 
* [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|digital breadcrumb]] trail making a route followed 
* personal [[Security alarm]] system to report that a particular person need help

SMS messages can be sent from any device that has a [[GSM]] modem or phone and a [[GPS]] receiver. There are commercial handheld devices in the market, built-in systems for vehicles, software for computers or mobile devices, as well as some homebuilding projects, such as a small device that connects a mobile phone with a GPS.

For the detection of theft of a vehicle, a device may be used which sends an SMS alert to the monitor coordinates of the object, as soon as it leaves a particular area.

'''Garden design''' is the art and process of [[design]]ing and creating plans for layout and planting of [[garden]]s and [[landscape]]s. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional [[garden designer]]s have some training in [[horticulture]] and the principles of design. Garden designer, [[Rev David Coles]], further elaborated this definition at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] (2018, BBC1, Chelsea) by stating that good garden design, while being on the one hand a “serious discipline” should embody a “playful creative mindfulness”. He postulates that successful garden designs enable transcendence from a physical sensory experience to a mindful awareness of being interconnected with nature. 
Some are also [[landscape architect|landscape architects]], a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Amateur gardeners may also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study, serious study in [[Master gardener program|Master Gardener Programs]], or by joining [[Garden club|gardening clubs]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Elements==
Whether gardens are designed by a professional or an amateur, certain principles form the basis of effective garden design, resulting in the creation of gardens to meet the needs, goals, and desires of the users or owners of the gardens.

Elements of garden design include the layout of [[hardscape|hard landscape]], such as paths, walls, [[Water garden|water features]], sitting areas and decking; as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their [[horticultural]] requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, [[Habit (biology)|growth habit]], size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choice of plants in terms of speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether [[Annual plant|annual]] or [[Perennial plant|perennial]], and bloom-time, and many other characteristics.

Important considerations in the garden design include how the garden will be used, the desired stylistic genre (formal or informal, modern or traditional etc.), and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the prescribed budget.

===Location===
A garden's location can have a substantial influence on its design. Topographical landscape features such as steep slopes, vistas, hills, and outcrops may suggest or determine aspects of design such as layout and can be used and augmented in order to create a particular impression.&lt;ref name="6 Most Beautiful Garden Designs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dronezon.com/best-drone-videos/six-most-beautiful-gardens-by-drone-calms-the-heart-and-mind/|title=6 Most Beautiful Gardens Designed To Calm The Mind|accessdate=September 20, 2015|work=Dronezon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soils of the site will affect what types of plant may be grown, as will the garden's [[climate zone]] and various [[microclimate]]s. The locational context of the garden can also influence its design. For example, an urban setting may require a different design style In contrast to a rural one. Similarly, a windy coastal location may necessitate a different treatment compared to a sheltered inland site.

===Soil===
The quality of a garden's [[soil]] can have a significant influence on a garden's design and its subsequent success. Soil influences the availability of water and nutrients, the activity of soil micro-organisms, and temperature within the root zone, and thus may have a determining effect on the types of plants which will grow successfully in the garden. However, soils may be replaced or improved in order to make them more suitable.

Traditionally, garden soil is improved by amendment, the process of adding beneficial materials to the native subsoil and particularly the [[topsoil]]. The added materials, which may consist of compost, [[peat]], sand, mineral dust, or manure, among others, are mixed with the soil to the preferred depth. The amount and type of amendment may depend on many factors, including the amount of existing soil humus, the soil structure (clay, silt, sand, loam etc.), the soil acidity/alkalinity, and the choice of plants to be grown. One source states that, "conditioning the soil thoroughly before planting enables the plants to establish themselves quickly and so play their part in the design."&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York: A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.213. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all gardens are, or should be, amended in this manner, since many plants prefer an impoverished soil. In this case, poor soil is better than a rich soil that has been artificially enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1998). ''Natural Landscapes.'' New York : Dorling Kindersly Limited, pp.54. {{ISBN|0-7894-1995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablehorticulture.com/myth-soil_amendments.pdf|title=Welcome sustainablehorticulture.com - BlueHost.com|website=www.sustainablehorticulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===
The design of a garden can be affected by the nature of its boundaries, both external and internal, and in turn the design can influence the boundaries, including via creation of new ones. Planting can be used to modify an existing boundary line by softening or widening it. Introducing internal boundaries can help divide or break up a garden into smaller areas.

The main types of boundary within a garden are hedges, walls and fences. A hedge may be evergreen or deciduous, formal or informal, short or tall, depending on the style of the garden and purpose of the boundary. A wall has a strong foundation beneath it at all points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Garden DIY Expert|publisher=pbi publications|year=1992|ISBN=0 903505 37 1|author=Dr D. G. Hessayon|authorlink = D. G. Hessayon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually - but not always - built from brick, stone or concrete blocks. A fence differs from a wall in that it is anchored only at intervals, and is usually constructed using wood or metal (such as iron or wire mesh).

Boundaries may be constructed for several reasons: to keep out livestock or intruders, to provide privacy, to create shelter from strong winds and provide microclimates, to screen unattractive structures or views, and to create an element of surprise.

===Surfaces===
[[Image:Planting-design.jpg|thumb|right|Naturalistic planting design]]
In temperate western gardens, a smooth expanse of lawn is often considered essential to a garden. However garden designers may use other surfaces, for example those "made up of loose gravel, small pebbles, or wood chips" in order to create a different appearance and feel.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York : A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.226. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers may also utilise the contrast in texture and color between different surfaces in order to create an overall pattern in the design.

Surfaces for paths and access points are chosen for practical as well as aesthetic reasons. Issues such as safety, maintenance and durability may need to be considered by the designer. Gardens designed for public access need to cope with heavier foot traffic and hence may utilise surfaces – such as resin-bonded gravel – that are rarely used in private gardens.

===Planting design===
Planting design requires [[design]] talent and aesthetic judgement combined with a good level of horticultural, ecological and cultural knowledge. It includes two major traditions: formal rectilinear planting design (Persia and Europe); and formal asymmetrical (Asia) and [[naturalistic planting design]].

====History====
[[Persian gardens]] are credited with originating aesthetic and diverse planting design. A correct Persian garden will be divided into four sectors with water being very important for both irrigation and aesthetics. The four sectors symbolize the Zoroastrian elements of sky, earth, water and plants.&lt;ref name="The Persian Garden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372/|title=The Persian Garden|accessdate=January 25, 2011|work=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting in ancient and Medieval European gardens was often a mix of herbs for medicinal use, vegetables for consumption, and flowers for decoration. Purely aesthetic planting layouts developed after the Medieval period in [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|Renaissance gardens]], as are shown in late-renaissance paintings and plans. The designs of the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] were geometrical and plants were used to form spaces and patterns. The [[gardens of the French Renaissance]] and Baroque [[Garden à la française]] era continued the '[[formal garden]]' planting aesthetic.

In Asia the asymmetrical traditions of planting design in [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese gardens]] originated in the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] of China. The gardens' plantings have a controlled but naturalistic aesthetic. In Europe the arrangement of plants in informal groups developed as part of the [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style, and subsequently the [[French landscape garden]], and was strongly influenced by the [[picturesque]] art movement.

====Application====
[[File:Garden chairs and table, Birkenhead - DSC09774.JPG|thumb|Garden chairs and table]]
A planting plan gives specific instructions, often for a [[general contractor|contractor]] about how the soil is to be prepared, what species are to be planted, what size and spacing is to be used and what maintenance operations are to be carried out under the contract. Owners of private gardens may also use planting plans, not for contractual purposes, as an aid to thinking about a design and as a record of what has been planted. A [[planting strategy]] is a long term strategy for the design, establishment and management of different types of vegetation in a landscape or garden.

Planting can be established by directly employed gardeners and horticulturalists or it can be established by a landscape contractor (also known as a landscape gardener). Landscape contractors work to drawings and specifications prepared by garden designers or landscape architects.

===Garden furniture===
{{Main|Garden furniture}}

Garden furniture may range from a ''patio set'' consisting of a [[Table (furniture)|table]], four or six [[chair]]s and a [[Umbrella|parasol]], through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Garden Furniture'', Charles Thonger, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, {{ISBN|0-554-70114-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patio heater]]s, that run on bottled [[butane]] or [[propane]], are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A [[picnic table]], is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden.

The materials used to manufacture modern patio furniture include [[Rock (geology)|stones]], [[metal]]s, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]]s, [[resins]], [[glass]], and [[Wood preservation|treated]] [[wood]]s.

===Sunlight===
{{See also|Shade garden}}
While sunlight is not always easily controlled by the gardener, it is an important element of garden design. The amount of available light is a critical factor in determining what plants may be grown. Sunlight will, therefore, have a substantial influence on the character of the garden. For example, a rose garden is generally not successful in full shade, while a garden of hostas may not thrive in hot sun. As another example, a vegetable garden may need to be placed in a sunny location, and if that location is not ideal for the overall garden design goals, the designer may need to change other aspects of the garden.

In some cases, the amount of available sunlight can be influenced by the gardener. The location of trees, other shade plants, garden structures, or, when designing an entire property, even buildings, might be selected or changed based on their influence in increasing or reducing the amount of sunlight provided to various areas of the property.

In other cases, the amount of sunlight is not under the gardener's control. Nearby buildings, plants on other properties, or simply the climate of the local area, may limit the available sunlight. Or, substantial changes in the light conditions of the garden may not be within the gardener's means. In this case, it is important to plan a garden that is compatible with the existing light conditions.

===Lighting===
Garden lighting can be an important aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, it is more important to determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.

Photosynthesis provides the energy required to produce the energy source of plants.

Phototropism is the effect of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light.&lt;ref&gt;American Horticultural Society (1980). ''Houseplants.'' Ortho Books and the Franklin Library,&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodism is a plant’s response or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.&lt;ref&gt;"Phoroperiodism." ''The Merriam-Webster Dicrionary Online.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of gardens==
[[File:PalacioDelGeneralife.JPG|thumb|200px|Moorish Generalife courtyard fountain]]

===Islamic gardens===
{{Main|Islamic garden}}

Garden design, and the [[Islamic garden|Islamic garden tradition]], began with creating the [[Paradise garden]] in [[Ancient Persia]], in [[Western Asia]]. It evolved over the centuries, and in the different cultures Islamic dynasties came to rule in Central— [[South Asia]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

A [[Formal Garden|formal garden]] in the [[Persian garden]] and European [[history of gardening|garden design traditions]] is rectilinear and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese garden]]s. The [[Zen garden]] of rocks, moss and raked gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. [[Tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[subshrub]]s and other [[leaf|foliage]] are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. A French garden or [[Garden à la française]], is a specific kind of formal garden, laid out in the manner of [[André Le Nôtre]]; it is centered on the façade of a building, with radiating [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and paths of gravel, lawns, [[parterre]]s and pools (''bassins'') of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with [[fountain]]s and sculpture.

The [[Garden à la française]] style has origins in fifteenth-century [[Italian Renaissance garden]]s, such as the [[Villa d'Este]], [[Boboli Gardens]], and [[Villa Lante]] in Italy. The style was brought to France and expressed in the [[gardens of the French Renaissance]]. Some of the earliest formal [[parterre]]s of clipped evergreens were those laid out at [[Anet]] by [[Claude Mollet]], the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted deep into the 18th century. The [[Gardens of Versailles]] are an ultimate example of Garden à la française, composed of many different distinct gardens, and designed by [[André Le Nôtre]].

[[English Renaissance]] gardens in a rectilinear formal design were a feature of the [[stately homes]]. The introduction of the parterre was at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s. In the early eighteenth century, the publication of [[Dezallier d'Argenville]], '' La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (1709) was translated into English and German, and was the central document for the later formal gardens of Continental Europe.

Traditional formal [[Spanish garden]] design evolved with [[Persian garden]] and [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|European Renaissance garden]] influences. The internationally renowned [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]], built in the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus]] era, have influenced design for centuries. The [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] was located in the celebrated [[Maria Luisa Park]] (''Parque de Maria Luisa'') designed by [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevilla5.com/monuments/plespana.html Sevilla-Parque de Maria Luisa. accessed 8 April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal gardening in the Italian and French manners was reintroduced at the turn of the twentieth century. [[Beatrix Farrand]]'s formal Italian garden areas at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Achille Duchêne]]'s restored French water parterre at [[Blenheim Palace]] in England are examples of the modern formal garden. The Conservatory Garden in [[Central Park]] of [[New York City]] features a formal garden, as do many other parks and estates such as [[Filoli]] in California.

The simplest formal garden would be a box-trimmed hedge lining or enclosing a carefully laid out [[flowerbed]] or garden bed of simple geometric shape, such as a [[knot garden]]. The more developed and elaborate formal gardens contain statuary and fountains.

===English Landscape and Naturalistic gardens===
{{Main|English garden|Landscape garden}} {{See also|List of landscape gardens}}
The [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style practically swept away the geometries of earlier English and European Renaissance formal gardens. [[William Kent]] and [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] were leading proponents, among many other designers. The naturalistic [[English garden|English Garden]] style (French:'' Jardin anglais'', Italian: ''Giardino all'inglese'', German: ''Englischer Landschaftsgarten'') of the 1730s and on transformed private and civic garden design across Europe. The [[French landscape garden|French Landscape Garden]] subsequently continued the style's development on the Continent.

===Cottage gardens===
{{Main|Cottage garden}}
A cottage garden uses an informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. Cottage gardens go back many centuries, but their popularity grew in 1870s England in response to the more structured Victorian [[English garden|English estate gardens]] that used restrained designs with massed beds of brilliantly colored greenhouse annuals. They are more casual by design, depending on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The influential British garden authors and designers, [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] at [[Gravetye Manor]] in [[Sussex]], and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] at [[Munstead Wood]] in [[Surrey]], both wrote and gardened in [[England]]. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings were an influence in Europe and the United States. Also influential half a century later was [[Margery Fish]], whose surviving garden at [[East Lambrook Manor]] emphasizes, among other things, native plant life and the natural patterns produced by self-spreading and self-seeding.

The earliest cottage gardens were far more practical than modern versions—with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with fruit trees, beehives, and even livestock if land allowed. Flowers were used to fill any spaces in between. Over time, flowers became more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-James, ''The Pleasure Garden'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations of the more traditional English cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitchen garden or potager===
{{Main|Kitchen garden}}
[[Image:VillandryPotager.jpg|thumb|right|Formal potager at Villandry, France]]
[[Image:Shakespeare garden.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from [[Walter Crane]]'s 1906 book,''Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden: a Posy from the Plays'']]
The traditional kitchen garden, also known as a potager, is a seasonally used space separate from the rest of the residential garden – the ornamental plants and lawn areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots with square or rectangular beds, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its history, but also its design.

The kitchen garden may be a [[landscape]] feature that can be the central feature of an ornamental, all-season landscape, but can be little more than a humble vegetable plot. It is a source of [[herb]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[flower]]s, but it is also a structured garden space, a design based on repetitive geometric patterns.

The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent [[perennials]] or woody plantings around (or among) the [[annual plants]].

===Shakespeare garden===
{{Main|Shakespeare garden}}

A Shakespeare garden is a themed garden that cultivates plants mentioned in the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, particularly the [[United States]], these are often public gardens associated with parks, universities, and Shakespeare festivals. Shakespeare gardens are sites of cultural, educational, and romantic interest and can be locations for outdoor weddings.

Signs near the plants usually provide relevant quotations. A Shakespeare garden usually includes several dozen species, either in herbaceous profusion or in a geometric layout with [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]] dividers. Typical amenities are walkways and benches and a weather-resistant bust of Shakespeare. Shakespeare gardens may accompany [[Tudorbethan architecture|reproductions of Elizabethan architecture]]. Some Shakespeare gardens also grow species typical of the Elizabethan period but not mentioned in Shakespeare's plays or poetry.

===Rock garden===
{{main|Rock garden}}
[[Image:RockGarden-NaturalStyle-19990622a.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A naturalistic rockery in England]]
[[File:Waterfall at Rock Garden, Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|[[Rock Garden, Chandigarh|Rock garden]] in [[Chandigarh]], [[India]]]]

A rock garden, also known as a rockery or an [[alpine garden]], is a type of garden that features extensive use of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[Rock (geology)|stones]], along with plants native to rocky or [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments.

Rock garden plants tend to be small, both because many of the species are naturally small, and so as not to cover up the rocks. They may be grown in troughs (containers), or in the ground. The plants will usually be types that prefer well-drained [[soil]] and less water.

The usual form of a rock garden is a pile of rocks, large and small, aesthetically arranged, and with small gaps between, where the plants will be rooted. Some rock gardens incorporate [[bonsai]].

Some rock gardens are designed and built to look like natural [[outcrop]]s of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane and plants are often used to conceal the joints between the stones. This type of rock garden was popular in Victorian times, often designed and built by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in modern campus or commercial [[landscape architecture|landscaping]], but can also be applied in smaller private gardens.

The [[Japanese rock garden]], in the west often referred to as ''Zen garden'', is a special kind of rock garden which contains few plants.
Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as [[landscape]] features in tropical countries such as [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=Thai Garden Style|year=1996|publisher=Asia Books Co., Ltd.|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy plastic liners to stop unwanted plant growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Rock Gardens|url=http://www.thaigardendesign.com/landscaping/2009/11/thai-rock-gardens.html|publisher=Thai Garden Design|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Maintenance a Pain?

===Native garden===
{{main|Natural landscaping}}
Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of [[native plants]], including trees, shrubs, [[groundcover]], and grasses which are [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the [[geographic area]] of the garden.
[[Image:Banksia spinulosa claret styles Georges River NP email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'', a Sydney local plant which attracts wildlife]]
Natural landscaping is adapted to the [[climate]], [[geography]] and [[hydrology]] and should require no [[pesticides]], [[fertilizers]] and watering to maintain, given that [[native plants]] have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years. However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or [[Landscape|weedy landscapes]].

Native plants suit today's interest in "[[low-maintenance]]" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without [[irrigation]] or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases.

Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time.

Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, [[pollinator]]s, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted [[introduced species]], [[cultivar]]s, and [[invasive species]]. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, or natural communities.&lt;ref name=Tallamy&gt;{{citation|title=Bringing Nature Home: How You Can Sustain Wildlife with Native Plants|author=Douglas Tallamy|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=9781604691467|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szK9uNKvTkQC|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no [[soil amendments]], irrigation, pesticides, and [[herbicide]]s for a lower maintenance, more [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] landscape.

===East Asian gardens===
{{Main|Chinese garden|Japanese garden|Japanese rock garden|Korean garden}}

Japanese and Korean gardens, originally influenced by [[Chinese garden]]s, can be found at [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples and historic sites, private homes, in neighborhood or city parks, and at historical [[landmark]]s such as [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples. Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the [[Western world]] and Japan are [[Japanese garden|gardens]] in the [[Japanese rock garden|''karesansui'' (rock garden)]] tradition. The [[Ryōan-ji]] temple garden is a well-known example. There are Japanese gardens of various styles, with plantings and often evoking ''wabi sabi'' simplicity. In [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], garden-making is a high art, intimately linked to the arts of [[calligraphy]] and [[ink painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26262/garden-and-landscape-design|title=Garden and landscape design: Japanese|accessdate=7 March 2008|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary garden===
[[File:Contemporarygarden2.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary garden]]
[[File:Contemporarygarden1.jpg|thumb|Contemporary water feature]]The contemporary style garden has gained popularity in the UK in the last 10 years. This is partly due to the increase of modern housing with small gardens as well as the cultural shift towards contemporary design {{who|date=April 2015}}. This style of garden can be defined by the use 'clean' design lines, with focus on hard landscaping materials like stone, hardwood, rendered walls. Planting style is bold but simple with the use of drifts of one or two plants that repeat throughout the design. Grasses are a very popular choice for this style of design. Lighting effects also play an integral role in the modern garden. Subtle lighting effects can be achieved with the use of carefully placed low voltage LED lights incorporated into paving and walls.

===Residential gardens===
{{See also|front garden|back garden}}
{{distinguish|forest garden}}
A residential or private domestic garden, is the most common form of garden and is in proximity to a [[house|residence]], such as the '[[front garden]]' or '[[back garden]]'. The front garden may be a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and local laws. While typically found in the [[yard (land)|yard]] of the residence, a garden may also be established on a [[Roof garden|roof]], in an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] or [[courtyard]], on a [[balcony]], in [[windowbox]]es, or on a [[Patio garden|patio]]. Residential gardens are typically designed at [[human scale]], as they are most often intended for private use. However, the garden of a [[great house]] or a large [[estate (house)|estate]] may be larger than a public park.

Residential gardens may feature specialized gardens, such as those for exhibiting one particular type of plant, or special features, such as [[rockery]] or [[water garden|water features]]. They are also used for growing [[herbs]] and [[vegetables]] and are thus an important element of [[sustainability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7745">'''Geography of aging''' or '''gerontological geography''' is an emerging field of knowledge of [[Human Geography]] that analyzes the socio-spatial implications of [[aging]] of the [[population]] from the understanding of the relationships between the [[Social environment|physical-social environment]] and the [[elderly]], at different scales, micro (City, region, country), etc.

Since the 1970s in a number of developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]], there have been increasing studies focusing on the understanding of spatial patterns of [[aging population]], as well as aspects related to residential changes and provision of health and social services. Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing.

The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of [[gerontology]] in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fernández-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-Pérez and Vicente Rodríguez-Rodríguez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol (Spain).

In [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]], Diego Sánchez-González has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and [[social environment]] and the [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]; the importance of the [[natural environment]] (therapeutic [[natural landscape]]) on active and [[healthy aging]] in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio-environmental [[vulnerability]] of the elderly in the face of [[climate change]]; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and [[public space]]); elderly people with [[disabilities]] and [[social exclusion]]; [[leisure]] and [[tourism]] of elderly; and the [[planning]] of gerontological and geriatric services.

{{dictionary}}
{{Wiktionary}}
'''Hinterland''' is a German word meaning "the land behind" (a [[city]], a port, or similar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pons.eu/english-german/hinterland Hinterland] – pons.eu, Pons Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The term's use in English was first documented by geographer [[George Chisholm (geographer)|George Chisholm]] in his ''[[Handbook of Commercial Geography]]'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040530/hinterland Definition of the term ''hinterland'' on ''Encyclopædia Britannica''], britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==

The term ''hinterland'' has several meanings. It may refer to:

==Geographic region==
* An area behind a coast or the shoreline of a river. Specifically, by the ''doctrine of the hinterland,'' the hinterland is the inland region lying behind a port and is claimed by the state that owns the coast.&lt;ref name="Kerr2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Kerr|title=Eastern Figures: Orient and Empire in British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUjqAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11#v=snippet&amp;q=%22doctrine%20of%20the%20hinterland%22&amp;f=false|date=June 1, 2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-934-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The area from which products are delivered to a port for shipping elsewhere is that port's hinterland.
* The term is also used to refer to the area around a city or town.
* More generally, ''hinterland'' can refer to the rural area economically tied to an urban [[catchment area]]. The size of a hinterland can depend on geography, or on the ease, speed, and cost of transportation between the port and the hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Woodburn, [http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2009/wp5/ECE-TRANS-WP5-GE1-03-inf04e.ppt#257,1, Hinterland connections to seaports], unece.org, January 23, 2009.  Accessed 2009.10.01.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In [[shipping]] usage, a port's hinterland is the area that it serves, both for imports and for exports.
* In [[History of colonialism|colonial]] usage, the term was applied to the surrounding areas of former European colonies in Africa, which, although not part of the colony itself, were influenced by the colony. By analogous general economic usage, hinterland can refer to the area surrounding a service from which customers are attracted, also called the market area.
* In German, ''Hinterland'' is sometimes used more generally to describe any sparsely populated area where the infrastructure is underdeveloped, although ''Provinz'' (analogous to ''province'') is more common. In the United States, and particularly in the [[American Midwest]] (a region of German cultural heritage located far from ocean ports), it is this meaning and not the one relating to ports that predominates in common use. Analogous terms include  "the countryside", "the sticks", "the boonies", ''[[backcountry]]'', ''[[boondocks]]'', [[The Bush (Alaska)|the Bush]] (in Alaskan usage), and the [[outback]] (in Australian usage).

==Breadth of knowledge==
A further sense in which the term is commonly applied, especially by British politicians, is in talking about an individual's depth and breadth of knowledge of other matters (or lack thereof), specifically of academic, artistic, cultural, literary and scientific pursuits. For instance, one could say, "X has a vast hinterland", or "Y has no hinterland". The spread of this usage is usually credited to [[Denis Healey]] (British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] 1964–1970, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] 1974–1979) and his wife [[Edna Healey]], initially in the context of the supposed lack of hinterland of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/14/biography.politicalbooks Roy Hattersley's review of Edward Pearce's biography of Healey], and Healey's autobiography ''Time of My Life'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter Industries products are used in a wide array of locations including sports stadiums, national landmarks, hotels, and city parks. They also offer products in several other industries, such as customer manufacturing, landscape lighting (through its acquisition of [[FX Luminaire]] in 2009), and the medical industry. They operate manufacturing facilities in both San Marcos, California, and [[Tijuana, Mexico]] as well as having overseas offices located in China. They previously operated a manufacturing plant in [[Cary, NC]], from 1992 to 2009, the plant closed due to poor market conditions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Hunter Industries Incorporated|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4278503|website=Bloomber Businessweek|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunter Industries acquires FX Luminaire |url=http://www.greenmediaonline.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=A1EFF0D153E046CCA156A96974F414D2&amp;AudID=374222F1A4794C91A8E3D4464352DF70 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141220000707/http://www.greenmediaonline.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=A1EFF0D153E046CCA156A96974F414D2&amp;AudID=374222F1A4794C91A8E3D4464352DF70 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 December 2014 |website=SportsTurf |accessdate=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FX Luminaire names Sales Manager of the Year|url=http://www.lawnandlandscape.com/ll-020912-italia-luminaire-manager.aspx|website=Lawn &amp; Landscape|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversification Is the Key to Hunter Sustainability|url=http://www.hunterindustries.com/en-metric/corporate/who-we-are/brands-and-products|website=Hunter Industries|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunter Industries to shut down Cary plant on Dec. 23|url=http://www.wral.com/business/story/6240588/|website=WRAL|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

As part of the increased focus on environmental sustainability in the irrigation industry, Hunter Industries has rolled out new and more eco-friendly sprinkler's, including the ''MP800SR Rotator'' (short range)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irrigation innovation|url=http://www.lawnandlandscape.com/ll-112514-irrigation-show-products.aspx|website=Lawn &amp; Landscape|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new dripline and subsurface irrigation offerings such as the ''eco-mat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trusty|first1=Steve|title=5 Key Trends in the Irrigation Industry|url=http://www.greenindustrypros.com/article/12050862/5-key-trends-in-the-irrigation-industry-in-2015|website=Green Industry Pros|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arson==

On October 26, 2003 a fire was started at the main location of Hunter Industries likely by a disgruntled employee or ex-employee, though no one was ever prosecuted for the crime. The fire caused damage to inventory and production areas of the plant, and caused the company to undergo major rebuilding. Fires had been started in 8 locations of the building using accelerants. Total losses reported due to the fire was $17 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Marcos, Calif.|url=http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article.php?id=3836|website=Landscape Online|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emerges"/&gt;

A "'''kilometric point'''" ({{lang-fr|'''Point kilométrique'''}}, {{lang-es|'''Punto kilométrico'''}}; '''PK''') is a term used in [[Metrication|metricated areas]], especially in [[France]] and [[Spain]], to provide [[Linear referencing|reference points]] alongside a transport route such as a [[road]], a [[railway line]] or a [[canal]]. It is calculated according to the distance in [[kilometre]]s  from a fixed commencement point. In the [[English-speaking world]], its equivalent would be [[milepost]] or [[mile marker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Landscape Institute''' ('''LI''') is a British [[professional body]] for [[landscape architecture|landscape architects]]. Founded in 1929 as the '''Institute of Landscape Architects''', it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1997. The Institute aims to promote landscape architecture, and to regulate the profession with a code of conduct that members must abide by. As of June 2013, it has 6,000 members, 3,300 of whom are chartered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/about/index.php About], Landscape Institute; see also [http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/PDF/Contribute/Landscape_Institute_Royal_Charter_Revised_Version_July_2008.pdf Royal Charter] and various other pages on the same website.&lt;/ref&gt;

It publishes the professional journal ''Landscape'' (formerly ''Landscape Design''), and is a member of the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]]. 

==Development of the profession==
The growth of landscape architecture has been led by government legislation since the 1940s, such as the [[New town#United Kingdom|New Towns Act]] (1946) which required landscape masterplans to be prepared, and the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive EIA Directive (85/337/EEC) (1985) which has led to the increase in [[environmental impact assessment]]s. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the public sector, particularly local authorities, were the largest employers of landscape architects, with a minority working in private practice. Today the private sector is the larger employer, although the largest single employer of landscape architects in the UK are the charitable [[Groundwork Trust]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===History of the Institute===
[[Thomas Mawson]] was the first President of the Institute of Landscape Architects (ILA) in 1929, and also one of the first professionals in the UK (along with [[Patrick Geddes]]) to use 'landscape architect' as a professional title. Before becoming President of the ILA, Mawson had been a President of the [[Royal Town Planning Institute|Town Planning Institute]]. His own career had developed from garden design to urban design.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
LI members include landscape designers, landscape managers, landscape planners, landscape scientists and urban designers. 
===Qualifying for membership===
The Affiliate membership category is an open category with minimal requirements. To become a professional member, however, candidates must first have completed an LI accredited university course or alternatively be assessed as a special case for admission as a ''Licentiate''. Following this they proceed along the Pathway to Chartership (P2C), a mentored and supervised programme of learning which culminates in an interview with two examiners who are senior members of the profession, once the candidate has attained an agreed level of competency. This process was formerly known as 'Part IV' of the Landscape Institute's own design examination. Parts I to III were replaced by the system of accredited degree courses in the mid 1980s. 

Only fully qualified members of the LI are permitted to use the protected title 'Chartered Member of the Landscape Institute' and the designation 'CMLI'. Chartered membership of the LI is accepted throughout Europe, The USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/membership/licentiate.php International Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091245/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/membership/licentiate.php |date=2009-07-01 }}, Landscape Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; while many countries who lack their own chartered professional body for Landscape Architects recognised as a badge of excellence. In May 2009 there were just under 6,000 members of the institute of which 3,000 were chartered.

==Activities==
In 2008, the LI, supported by [[CABE]] launched a campaign, projected to run for five years, to increase the number of Landscape Architects in the UK. Entitled ''I want to be a landscape architect'', it has its own website, and focuses on increasing the number of [[postgraduate]] and [[undergraduate]] students taking LI [[accredited]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwanttobealandscapearchitect.com/ I want to be a landscape architect], Landscape Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LI is one of the steering group partners of [[Neighbourhoods Green]] a partnership initiative which works with social landlords and housing associations to highlight the importance of, and raise the overall quality of design and management for, open and green space in social housing.

This is a '''list of firsts in the [[Geographic North Pole]]'''.

* One of the first to reach the Geographic North Pole (disputed): there were two primary claimants, [[Frederick Cook]], and his two [[Inuit]] men, Aapilak and Ittukusuk, on April 21, 1908 and [[Robert Edwin Peary]], [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men: [[Ootah]], [[Seegloo]], [[Egingway]], and [[Ooqueah]] on April 6, 1909. Peary and Henson's claim eventually won widespread acceptance, but now neither claim is widely accepted.
* First to fly over the North Pole (disputed): On May 9, 1926, Americans [[Richard E. Byrd]] and pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] claimed a successful flight over the North Pole in a Fokker F-VII Tri-motor called the ''Josephine Ford''.  Byrd took off from [[Spitsbergen]] and returned to the same airfield. His claim, widely accepted at first, has been challenged since.
* First [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight over the North Pole: On May 12, three days after the Byrd flight, Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]], his American sponsor [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and the Italian aeronautic engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] flew over the Pole in the [[semi-rigid airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'', designed and piloted by Nobile.

A '''Local Notice to Mariners''' is an authoritative instruction issued by a designated official, typically the [[harbormaster]].

==United States==

In the United States, notices are issued by each [[U.S. Coast Guard]] District to disseminate important information affecting navigational safety within that District. This Notice reports changes and deficiencies in aids to navigation maintained by the Coast Guard. Other marine information such as new [[nautical chart|charts]], channel depths, naval operations, and regattas is included. Since temporary information of short duration is not included in the weekly [[Notice to Mariners]], the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be the only source of such information. Small craft using the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and small harbors not normally used by oceangoing vessels need it to keep charts and publications up-to-date.

Since correcting information for U.S. charts in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from the Coast Guard Local Notices, it is normal to expect a lag of 1 or 2 weeks for the ''Notice to Mariners'' to publish a correction from this source.

The ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be obtained free of charge by contacting the appropriate Coast Guard District Commander. Vessels operating in ports and waterways in several districts must obtain the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' from each district. &lt;!-- See Figure 422 for a complete list of U.S. Coast Guard Districts. provide a link instead--&gt;

===Sources===
The text of the US material originated from section 422 of The [[American Practical Navigator]], a document produced by the government of the [[United States|United States of America]].

==Examples==
LNTMs are, by definition, concerned with local issues. Each issuing authority has its own series of LNTMs – there is no international standard numbering or indexing scheme. Individual LNTMs may concern short or long term situations. At [http://www.qhmportsmouth.com/port-lntm/ Portsmouth], mariners are instructed by LNTM 28/07 to ''keep clear of warship berths''. At [http://www.holyheadport.com/LNTM%20Index.pdf Holyhead], LNTM 5/2008 concerns ''Bunkering or transferring oil in port''. At [http://www.conservancy.co.uk/water/local_notices.asp Chichester], No 16 of 2008 ''Sea defence works at Hayling Island'' gives timely information about dredging operations.

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instarea defines location intelligence as "Using [[machine learning]] algorithms to uncover trends that would be otherwise unknown using human based rules in a large location data set."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">[[Image:MSquares.gif|right|200px|thumb|A Marsden Square map]]
'''Marsden square''' mapping or '''Marsden squares''' is a system that divides a chart of the world with latitude-longitude gridlines (e.g. [[plate carrée projection]], [[Mercator Projection|Mercator]] or other) between [[80th parallel north|80°N]] and [[70th parallel south|70°S]] latitudes (or [[north pole|90°N]] and [[80th parallel south|80°S]]: refer chart at Ocean Teacher’s [http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/06_OcDtaMgtProc/01_DataOps/06_OcDtaForm/01_OcDtaFormFunda/02_Geography/03_SquaresSheets/OceanSquaresMapsheets.htm Ocean&amp;nbsp;Geography] page) into grid cells of 10° [[latitude]] by 10° [[longitude]], each with a unique, numeric identifier. [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], when first secretary of the Admiralty, conceived of this method for collecting and combining information respecting the oceans &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Weather_Book.html?id=qNK7AAAAIAAJ Robert Fitzroy, "The Weather Book: A Manual of Practical Meteorology," Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, &amp; Green (1863), p.49.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Structure &amp; Design == 
On the plate carrée projection the grid cells appear square, however if the Mercator projection is used, the grid cells appear “stretched” vertically nearer the tops and bottoms of the map.

On the actual surface of the [[Globe]], the cells are approximately “square” only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four.

Each one of the 540 10°x10° squares is allocated a number from 1 to 288 and from 300 to 551 (see image to the right), plus the sequence extends to 936 in higher latitudes, and then can also be subdivided into 100 one-degree squares numbered from 00 to 99 in order to improve accuracy.

== Use ==
Marsden squares have mostly been used for identifying the geographic position of [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data, and are described further in various publications of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The 10°x10° square identifiers typically use a minimal number of characters (between 1 and 3 digits) which was/is an operational advantage for low bandwidth transmission systems.

However the rules for allocating numbers to squares do not follow a consistent pattern, so that reverse-engineering (decoding) the relevant square boundaries from any particular Marsden Square identifier is not particularly straightforward (a look-up table is probably the simplest in practice).

Slightly confusingly, an alternative (and more consistent), four-digit notation for global 10°x10° squares is actually known as [[World Meteorological Organization squares]] but does not seem to be actively promoted by the WMO itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">Whereas originally the term [[Navigation]] applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination, '''Navigation research''' deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general. It can be defined as "The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location" (Franz, Mallot, 2000).
It concerns basically all moving [[Agent (grammar)|agents]], [[biology|biological]] or artificial, [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] or remote-controlled.

Franz and Mallot proposed a navigation hierarchy in ''Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30'' (2006):&lt;ref name=FM1&gt;{{cite book|author=Franz|author2=Mallot|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V16-3YHG97R-K&amp;_user=946230&amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2000&amp;_rdoc=9&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235666%232000%23999699998%23159597!&amp;_cdi=5666&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_acct=C000049009&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=946230&amp;md5=8c30c4f00f8e97c08651032b4d118e90|title=Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30|year=2000|pages=133–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic methods for navigation:

* [[Egocentric navigation]] also known as Idiothetic navigation
* [[Allocentric navigation]] also known as Allothetic navigation

== Human navigation==
In human navigation people visualize different routes in their minds to plan how to get from one place to another. The things which they rely on to plan these routes vary from person to person and are the basis of the differing navigational strategies.
  
Some people use measures of distance and absolute directional terms (north, south, east, and west) in order to visualize the best pathway from point to point. The use of these more general, external cues as directions is considered part of an allocentric navigation strategy. [[Allocentric navigation]] is typically seen in males and is beneficial primarily in large and/or unfamiliar environments.&lt;ref name= "one"&gt;Andreano &amp; Cahill (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This likely has some basis in evolution when males would have to navigate through large and unfamiliar environments while hunting.&lt;ref name= "two"&gt;Geary (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of allocentric strategies when navigating primarily activates the hippocampus and parahippocampus in the brain. This navigation strategy relies more on a mental, spatial map than visible cues, giving it an advantage in unknown areas but a flexibility to be used in smaller environments as well. The fact that it is mainly males that favor this strategy is likely related to the generalization that males are better navigators than females as it is better able to be applied in a greater variety of settings.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

[[Egocentric navigation]] relies on more local landmarks and personal directions (left/right) to navigate and visualize a pathway. This reliance on more local and well-known stimuli for finding their way makes it difficult to apply in new locations, but is instead most effective in smaller, familiar environments.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Evolutionarily, egocentric navigation likely comes from our ancestors who would forage for their food and need to be able to return to the same places daily to find edible plants. This foraging usually occurred in relatively nearby areas and was most commonly done by the females in hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Females, today, are typically better at knowing where various landmarks are and often rely on them when giving directions. Egocentric navigation causes high levels of activation in the right parietal lobe and prefrontal regions of the brain that are involved in visuospatial processing.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

== Robotic navigation ==
{{Main|Robotic navigation}}
[[Outdoor]] robots can use GPS in a similar way to [[automotive navigation system]]s.
Alternative systems can be used with [[floor plan]] instead of [[map]]s for [[indoor]] robots, combined with localization wireless hardware.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9203">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''[[Office for National Statistics]]''' maintains a series of codes to represent a wide range of geographical areas of the UK, for use in tabulating [[census]] and other statistical data.  These codes are referred to as '''ONS codes''' or '''GSS codes''' referring to the ''[[Government Statistical Service]]'' of which ONS is part.

The previous hierarchical system of codes has been replaced as from January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Geography Codes and Naming Policy implemented 1 January 2011|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Info.do?page=nessgeography/new-geography-codes-and-naming-policy-from-1-january-2011.htm|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a nine-character code for all types of geography, in which there is no relation between the code for a lower-tier area and the corresponding parent area. The older coding system has now been phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/geographic-policy/coding-and-naming-for-statistical-geographies/frequently-asked-questions.pdf|title=GSS Coding and Naming - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=Office for National Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography of the UK Census ==
Information from the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] is published for a wide variety of geographical units.  These areas include:

* [[County#United Kingdom|Counties]] in [[England]]
* [[District#United Kingdom|Districts]] within English counties, and [[Unitary Authority]] areas served by one council providing district and county functions
* Unitary council areas in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]
* [[Civil parishes in England|Civil parishes]] ([[Community (Wales)|communities]] in Wales)
* Electoral [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] (called electoral divisions in Wales).  These are the areas defined for the election of local councillors, but are also widely used for presenting statistics at a smaller scale than the whole district.
* Census output areas (OA).  These are the smallest unit for which census data are published - they were initially generated to support publication of [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] outputs and contain at least 40 households and 100 persons, the target size being 125 households.  They were built up from [[postcode]] blocks ''after'' the census data were available, with the intention of standardising population sizes, geographical shape and social homogeneity (in terms of dwelling types and housing tenure).  The OAs generated in 2001 were retained as far as possible for the publication of outputs from the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] (less than 3% were changed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Output Areas|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/census/output-area--oas-/index.html|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Before 2001, census data were published for larger Enumeration Districts (ED) which were delineated before the census was conducted and were the organisational units for census data collection.

== Neighbourhood Statistics Geography ==
&lt;!-- This section head is a redirect from [[Super Output Areas]] --&gt;
Super Output Areas (SOAs) are a set of geographical areas developed following the 2001 census, initially to facilitate the calculation of the [[Indices of deprivation 2004|Indices of Deprivation 2004]] and subsequently for a range of additional [[Neighbourhood Statistics]] (NeSS). The aim was to produce a set of areas of consistent size, whose boundaries would not change (unlike electoral wards), suitable for the publication of data such as the Indices of Deprivation. They are an aggregation of adjacent Output Areas with similar social characteristics. Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) typically contain 4 to 6 OAs with a population of around 1500. Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) on average have a population of 7,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Output Areas|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Info.do?page=aboutneighbourhood/geography/superoutputareas/soa-intro.htm|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hierarchy of Output Areas and the two tiers of Super Output Areas have become known as the Neighbourhood Statistics Geography.

== Former hierarchical coding system ==
The older ONS code was constructed top down: 
*A two-character code represented an [[administrative county]].
For example, &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; for Cambridgeshire.
*A four-character code represented a [[district]], so that the first two characters showed the county in which the district was placed.
For example, &lt;code&gt;12UB&lt;/code&gt; for Cambridge district or  &lt;code&gt;12UD&lt;/code&gt; for Fenland.
*In the case of a [[unitary authority]] (including metropolitan and London boroughs) the first two digits were 00.
For example,  &lt;code&gt;00AL&lt;/code&gt; for [[Greenwich]] (London Borough) or &lt;code&gt;00EC&lt;/code&gt; for [[Middlesbrough]].
*Local Government [[Ward (politics)|wards]] were given a two-letter code within their local authority.
For example, &lt;code&gt;12UBGA&lt;/code&gt; for Petersfield Ward within Cambridge district.  
*The smallest level, Census OAs were originally given  an additional 4 digits within a ward, so that the first output area in Petersfield Ward was coded &lt;code&gt;12UBGA0001&lt;/code&gt;.
*Civil parishes were also coded using this hierarchical system.  Parishes were coded using an additional 3 digits after their local authority.  For example, within &lt;code&gt;12UD&lt;/code&gt; for Fenland district, the parish of Tydd St. Giles was coded &lt;code&gt;12UD010&lt;/code&gt;.

== Current GSS coding system ==
The current system replaces these codes with a fixed length code of nine characters.  The first three characters indicate the level of geography and the six digits following define the individual unit.  For example, the Royal Borough of Greenwich is coded as &lt;code&gt;E09000011&lt;/code&gt;, Middlesbrough is &lt;code&gt;E06000002&lt;/code&gt;, Cambridge &lt;code&gt;E07000008&lt;/code&gt; and Fenland &lt;code&gt;E07000010&lt;/code&gt;.

The meaning of some common three character prefixes is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Geographic Codes (RGC)|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/names--codes-and-look-ups/register-of-geographic-codes/index.html|work=Coding and Naming for Statistical Geographies|publisher=ONS|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONS Geography Linked Data|url=http://statistics.data.gov.uk/|work=Coding and Naming for Statistical Geographies|publisher=ONS|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">A '''pan-region''' is a [[geographic region]] or state’s sphere of economic, political and cultural influence extending beyond that state's borders. For example, the pan-region of the [[United States of America]] (USA) regions both bordering the USA and its close neighbors including, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and many [[South American|South America]] other states.

==Origin of term==
The idea of pan-regions or spheres of economic and cultural influence was first developed by [[Karl Ernst Haushofer]] (8/27/1869-3/10/1946), a German General, [[Geography|geographer]] and [[Geopolitics|geo-politician]]. Pan-regions contributed to Geopolitik or the German theories of [[foreign policy]] during the interwar period (1918–1939) or the time from the end of [[World War I]] and the beginning of [[World War II]]. Haushofer’s pan-regions divided the world under three supreme leading states in [[economy]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Those three states included the USA who controlled [[North America]] and much of South America, [[Germany]] who controlled [[Europe]], much of [[Africa]] and [[western Asia]] and [[Japan]] who controlled central, eastern, and the islands of southern Asia. These leading states could expect their regions to develop economic and [[political alliance]] with their leading state as well as yield to [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and major cultural designations.

==Historical examples==
Historically, the world was divided into three spheres of control, however after the end of World War II, Germany and Japan’s control over their various regions have diminished with the success of other nations. For example, German control over Europe has suffered with the development of the [[Europe]]an Union and emergence of other foreign powers. Japan also is beginning to lose economic dominance over its pan-region with the emergence of a thriving [[Chinese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter, and Colin Flint. Political Geography World, Economy, Nation, State and Locality (4th Edition). Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parkway''' is a broad, landscaped [[highway]] [[thoroughfare]].&lt;ref name="Parkway"&gt;''"parkway."''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (14 Apr. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is particularly used for a roadway in a [[park]] or connecting to a park from which trucks and other [[heavy vehicle]]s are excluded.&lt;ref name="Parkway"/&gt; Many parkways originally intended for scenic, recreational driving have evolved into major urban and commuter routes.

The term ''parkway'' is sometimes applied more generally to a variety of [[limited-access road]]s.

In Russia, long, broad (multi-lane) and beautified thoroughfares are referred to as [[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]s.

==United States==
[[File:Eastern Pkwy west of New York Ave.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brooklyn]]'s [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]], the world's first parkway, according to the [[New York City]] [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Department of Parks and Recreation]].]]
[[File:IMG 2237 - Clara Barton Pkwy at NSWC (looking west).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Clara Barton Parkway]] in [[Maryland]]]]

===Scenic roads===
Over the years, many different types of roads have been labeled parkways.

The first parkways in the [[United States]] were developed during the late 19th century by landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Beatrix Farrand]] as roads segregated for{{clarifyme|date=March 2018}} pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and [[horse carriage]]s, such as the [[Eastern Parkway]], which is credited as the world's first parkway,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=196&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The terminology "parkway" to define this type of road was coined by [[Calvert Vaux]] and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with "pleasure roads".

Newer roads such as [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Bidwell]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and Park Presidio Boulevard in [[San Francisco, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Jeanne|title=History of Park Presidio Boulevard|website=ppnsf.org/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. 

During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include [[limited-access highway]]s designed for recreational driving of automobiles, with [[landscape|landscaping]]. These parkways originally provided [[scenic route]]s without very slow or [[commercial vehicle]]s, at [[Level crossing|grade intersections]], or pedestrian traffic. Examples are the [[Merritt Parkway]] in Connecticut and the [[Vanderbilt Motor Parkway]] in New York. But their success led to more development, expanding a city's boundaries, eventually limiting the parkway's recreational driving use. The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California]] is an example of lost [[pastoral]] aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name "parkway".

===Early high speed roads===
{{See also|Parkways in New York State}}
In New York City, construction on the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] (Vanderbilt Parkway) began in 1906 and planning for the [[Bronx River Parkway]] in 1907. In the 1920s, the  [[New York City Metropolitan Area]]'s parkway system grew under the direction of [[Robert Moses]], the president of the New York State Council of Parks and [[Long Island State Park Commission]], who used parkways to create and access state parks, especially for city dwellers. As Commissioner of New York City Parks under Mayor LaGuardia, he extended the parkways to the heart of the city, creating and linking its parks to the greater metropolitan systems.

Most of the New York metropolitan parkways were designed by Gilmore Clark. The famed "Gateway to New England" [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Connecticut]] was designed in the 1930s as a pleasurable alternative for affluent locals to the congested Boston Post Road, running through forest with each bridge designed uniquely to enhance the scenery. Another example is the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] from [[The Bronx]] to become the [[Taconic State Parkway]] to [[Chatham, New York]]. [[Landscape architect]] [[George Kessler]] designed extensive parkway systems for [[Kansas City, Missouri#Parks and boulevard system|Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Memphis Park and Parkway System|Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Indianapolis Park and Boulevard System|Indianapolis]]; and other cities at the beginning of the 20th century.

[[File:Natchez-Trace-Parkway-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]]]

===New Deal roads===
In the 1930s, as part of the [[New Deal]] the U.S. federal government constructed [[National Parkway]]s designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower [[speed limit]]s and are maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. An example is the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) built [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].

Others are: [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Virginia]]; the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] in [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]; and the [[Colonial Parkway]] in eastern Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20121009162431/http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-date = October 9, 2012 |first1 = Tim |last1 = Thornton |first2 = Isak |last2 = Howell |title = Parkway’s Past Haunts Its Future |work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]], running along the [[Potomac River]] near [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]], were also constructed during this era.

===Post-war parkways===
In [[Kentucky]] the term "parkway" designates a [[controlled-access highway]] in the [[:Category:Kentucky parkway system|Kentucky Parkway system]], with nine built in the 1960s and 1970s. They were [[toll road]]s until the [[construction bond]]s were repaid, and are now [[freeway]]s since 2006.

The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] from [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to [[Los Angeles]], built in 1940, was the first segment of the vast [[Southern California]] freeway system. It became part of [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|State Route 110]] and was renamed the Pasadena Freeway. A 2010 restoration of the freeway brought the Arroyo Seco Parkway designation back.

[[File:Truckersuseexpwysnotpkwys.jpg|thumb|right|Sign informing truckers it is illegal to use a parkway in [[New York City]].]]
In the [[New York metropolitan area]], contemporary parkways are predominantly controlled-access highways restricted to non-commercial traffic, excluding [[truck]]s and [[tractor-trailer]]s. Some have low overpasses that also exclude buses. The Vanderbilt Parkway, an exception in western [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], is a surviving remnant of the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] that became a [[surface street]], no longer with controlled-access or non-commercial vehicle restrictions. The [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] is a post-war parkway that starts at the [[George Washington Bridge]], heads north through New Jersey, continuing through Rockland and Orange counties in New York. The Palisades Parkway was built to allow for a direct route from New York City to [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]].

In New Jersey, the [[Garden State Parkway]], connecting the urban Northeast U.S. with the [[Jersey Shore]] and [[Atlantic City]], is restricted to buses and non-commercial traffic north of the [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] interchange but is one of the busiest [[toll road]]s in the country.&lt;ref name=njdottrucks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/rules/pdf/chapter32truckaccess.pdf|title=Title 16.

In the [[Pittsburgh]] region, two of the major Interstates are referred to informally as parkways. The Parkway East ([[Interstate 376|I-376]], formally the [[Penn-Lincoln Parkway]]) connects Downtown Pittsburgh to [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]]. The Parkway West ([[Interstate 376|I-376]]) runs through the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and links Downtown to [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], southbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]], [[Imperial, Pennsylvania]], and westbound US&amp;nbsp;22/US&amp;nbsp;30. The Parkway North ([[Interstate 279|I-279]]) connects Downtown to [[Franklin Park, Pennsylvania]] and northbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]].
&lt;!---personal view &amp; opinions, &amp; missing NPOV---Many opponents of increased road construction in the [[United States]]{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that the use of the term "parkway" in any sense other than as a scenic route through parkland, is deceptive. It is claimed by such advocates{{Who|date=December 2008}} that many existing and proposed parkways (such as the proposed [[West Eugene Parkway]] in [[Oregon]]) are functionally indistinguishable from [[freeway]]s and/or [[Limited-access road|expressways]], and the "parkway" label is used to make construction of such routes seem more palatable to the public{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (who might otherwise stage a [[Freeway revolts|freeway revolt]], especially if their neighborhood is affected).  Others{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that this is splitting hairs; and that the use of the term "parkway" in conjunction with urban and suburban highways is a well-established practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Furthermore, most routes{{where}} designated with the "parkway" label do have scenic enhancements (making the route more attractive for both motorists and neighbors),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and many such routes do exclude trucks. As truck traffic interferes with normal vehicle movement the congestion in the road can be reduced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}---&gt;

In the suburbs of [[Philadelphia]], [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 202]] follows an at-grade parkway alignment known as the "U.S. Route 202 Parkway" between [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]] and [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]]. The parkway varies from two to four lanes in width, has {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} shoulders, a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} walking path called the [[US 202 Parkway Trail]] on the side, and a {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. The parkway opened in 2012 as a bypass of a section of US 202 between the two towns; it had originally been proposed as a four-lane freeway before funding for the road was cut.&lt;ref name=inq12312&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Mucha|title=New Route 202 parkway opens today|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=December 3, 2012|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20121203_New_Route_202_parkway_opens_today.html|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intell"&gt;{{cite news|first=Freda R. |last=Savana|title=Make way for the 202 Parkway|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intell2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christina |last=Kristofic|title=PennDOT to hold meetings on noise from parkway|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Minneapolis]], the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system has {{convert|50|mi|km}} of streets designated as parkways. These are not freeways; they have a slow {{convert|25|mph|km/h|adj=on}} speed limit, pedestrian crossings, and stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisparks.org/grandrounds/inf_about.htm|title=Information Center: About the Grand Rounds|accessdate=2007-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214064938/http://www.minneapolisparks.org/grandrounds/inf_about.htm|archivedate=2015-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondward.blogspot.com/2007/01/traffic-calming-event.html|title=Second Ward, Minneapolis: Traffic Calming Event|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cincinnati]], parkways are major roads which trucks are prohibited from using. Some Cincinnati parkways, such as Columbia Parkway, are high-speed, limited-access roads, while others, such as Central Parkway, are multi-lane urban roads without controlled access. Columbia Parkway carries US-50 traffic from downtown towards east-side suburbs of Mariemont, Anderson, and Milford, and is a limited access road from downtown to the Village of Mariemont.

==Canada==
[[File:Icefields Parkway-02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Icefields Parkway]] runs through the [[Canadian Rockies]] in [[Jasper National Park]] and [[Banff National Park]].]]

"Parkway" is used in the names of many [[Canada|Canadian]] roads, including major routes through [[National parks of Canada|national parks]], scenic drives, major urban thoroughfares, and even regular freeways that carry commercial traffic.

Parkways in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] are administered by the [[National Capital Commission|National Capital Region (Canada)]]. However, some of them are named "drive" or "driveway".

The term in Canada is also applied to multi-use paths and [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] used by walkers and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translink.ca/en/Getting-Around/Cycling/BC-Parkway.aspx BC Parkway, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/playin/WellandCanalsParkwayTrail.asp Welland Canals Parkway Trail, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Parkway (disambiguation)}}
The United Kingdom has parkways (known in that region as a [[carriageway]]) in many large towns and cities.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} Most examples are motorways or [[A road (UK)|A roads]]. Some parkways including [[Chelmsford]] Parkway have flyovers leading to major roads.

===Bristol (and other) park-and-ride railway stations===
[[File:Luton Airport Parkway railway station.jpg|thumb|270px|Luton Airport Parkway railway station]]
Several mainly park-and-ride-status railway stations in England have the suffix "parkway" in their name. The etymology is from the original U.S. meaning as the [[Bristol Parkway railway station]] was named after the adjacent [[M32 motorway]], originally known as The Parkway because of its green-[[buffer zone|buffered]] route into the city. Bristol Parkway was the first railway station so named, in 1972. The majority of such stations were opened in the late 20th century to relieve pressure on existing city centre stations. Examples such as [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]] are renamings following the expansion of the car parking facilities where the name is used promotionally (for example commuters to Oxford are encouraged to leave their car at Didcot and travel to Oxford by train) whereas in others with multi-storey car parks serving modest settlements such as [[Brookwood railway station|Brookwood]] and [[Fleet railway station|Fleet]] the suffix has not been adopted.

[[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport Parkway]] and [[Southampton Airport Parkway railway station|Southampton Airport Parkway]] are examples serving [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southampton Airport|Southampton]] airports. Some were so named as they are not in easy walking distance of an airport terminal; passengers use shuttle bus services, although Southampton Airport station is within easy walking distance of Southampton Airport and has no separate car parking facilities of its own.

===Peterborough===
{{further|Road transport in Peterborough}}
The city and [[New towns in the United Kingdom|third-generation new town]] of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] (population of 184,500 as at 2011 census) has an overall free-capacity system roads branded as "parkways", which together with other roads provide routes for much through traffic and local traffic sufficient to cope in most peak hours. The majority are dual carriageways, with many of their junctions numbered. Five main parkways (Soke Parkway, Nene Parkway, Fletton Parkway, Frank Perkins Parkway, Paston Parkway) form an orbital outer ring road. Orton Parkway, Werrington Parkway, Longthorpe Parkway are named after the settlements they serve. For example, Werrington Parkway is an arbitrary renaming of a short section of the A15 Lincoln Road.

===Plymouth===
In the [[Plymouth#Government|City of Plymouth]], the [[A38 road|A38]] is called "The Parkway" and bisects a rural belt of the [[unitary authority|local authority]] area, which coincides with the geographical centre; it has two junctions to enter the downtown part of the city.

== Australia ==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The [[Australian Capital Territory]] uses the term "parkway" to refer to roadways of a standard approximately equivalent to what would be designated as an "expressway", "freeway", or "motorway" in other areas. Parkways generally have multiple lanes in each direction of travel, no intersections (crossroads are accessed by interchanges), high speed limits, and are of dual carriageway design (or have high crash barriers on the median).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majuraparkway.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/161316/EPBC_Referral_Majura_Parkway_to_DEWHA_Rev1.pdf EPBC Referral - Majura Parkway to DEWHA (Revision 1)], SMEC, Page 9, 19 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] uses the term "parkway" to sometimes refer to smaller local access roads that travel through parkland. Unlike other uses of the term, these parkways are not high-speed routes but may still have some degree of limited access.

==Singapore==
[[Singapore]] uses the term "parkway" as an alternative to "[[Expressways of Singapore|expressway]]". As such, parkways are also dual carriageways with high speed limits and [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]]. The [[East Coast Parkway]] is currently the only expressway in Singapore that uses this terminology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20611">[[File:Ancient Beijing observatory 14.jpg|thumb|A large frame quadrant at the [[Beijing Ancient Observatory]].  It was constructed in 1673.]]
A '''quadrant''' is an instrument that is used to measure angles up to 90°. Different versions of this instrument could be used to calculate various readings, such as longitude, latitude, and time of day. It was originally proposed by [[Ptolemy]] as a better kind of [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Telescope |first=Henry C. |last=King |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2003 |orig-year=1955 |isbn=978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different variations of the instrument were later produced by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim astronomers]].

==Etymology==
The term “quadrant”, meaning one fourth, refers to the fact that early versions of the instrument were derived from astrolabes. The quadrant condensed the workings of the astrolabe into an area one fourth the size of the astrolabe face; it was essentially a quarter of an astrolabe.

==History==
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy]] using a quadrant]]
One of the earliest accounts of a quadrant comes from [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] Almagest around 150 CE. He described a “plinth” that could measure the altitude of the noon sun by projecting the shadow of a peg on a graduated arc of 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackermann|first1=Silke|last2=Van Gent|first2=Robert|title=Quadrant|url=https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/epact/article.php?ArticleID=14|website=Epact: Scientific Instruments of Medieval and Renaissance Europe|publisher=Museum of the History of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quadrant was unlike later versions of the instrument; it was larger and consisted of several moving parts. Ptolemy’s version was a derivative of the astrolabe and the purpose of this rudimentary device was to measure the meridian angle of the sun.

Islamic astronomers in the Middle Ages improved upon these ideas and constructed quadrants throughout the Middle East, in observatories such as [[Maragheh observatory|Marageh]], [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Samarkand]]. At first these quadrants were usually very large and stationary, and could be rotated to any bearing to give both the altitude and azimuth for any celestial body.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"/&gt; As Islamic astronomers made advancements in astronomical theory and observational accuracy they are credited with developing four different types of quadrants during the Middle Ages and beyond. The first of these, the sine quadrant, was invented by [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in the 9th century at the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=king1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=David A.|title=Islamic Astronomical Instruments|date=1987|publisher=Variorum Reprints|location=London|isbn=0860782018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} The other types were the universal quadrant, the horary quadrant and the astrolabe quadrant.

During the Middle Ages the knowledge of these instruments spread to Europe. In the 13th century Jewish astronomer [[Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon]] was crucial in further developing the quadrant.&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=J.J.|title=Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tibbon.html|website=Tibbon Biography|publisher=University of St. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a skilled astronomer and wrote several volumes on the topic, including an influential book detailing how to build and use an improved version of the quadrant. The quadrant that he invented came to be known as the “novus quadrans”, or new quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Astrolabe Quadrant|url=https://www.astrolabes.org/pages/quadrant.htm|website=Astrolabes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was revolutionary because it was the first quadrant to be built that did not involve several moving parts and thus could be much smaller and more portable.

Tibbon’s Hebrew manuscripts were translated into Latin and improved upon by French scholar [[Peter Nightingale]] several years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Philomena of Dacia, also known as Petrus Dacus, Petrus Danus, Peter Nightingale |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/peter-philomena-daciaalso-known-petrus-dacus-petrus-danus-peter-nightingale |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lindberg|editor-first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1988|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0226482332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the translation, Tibbon, or Prophatius Judaeus as he was known in Latin, became an influential name in astronomy. His new quadrant was based upon the idea that the stereographic projection that defines a planispheric astrolabe can still work if the astrolabe parts are folded into a single quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=Olaf|title=Early physics and astronomy : a historical introduction |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|isbn=0521408997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a device that was far cheaper, easier to use and more portable than a standard astrolabe. Tibbon’s work had a far reach and influenced [[Copernicus]], [[Christopher Clavius]] and [[Erasmus Reinhold]]; and his manuscript was referenced in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] [[Divine Comedy]].&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"/&gt;

As the quadrant became smaller and thus more portable, its value for navigation was soon realized. The first documented use of the quadrant to navigate at sea is in 1461, by [[Diogo Gomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quadrant|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/quadrant.htm|website=Department of Mathematics|publisher=University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors began by measuring the height of Polaris to ascertain their latitude. This application of quadrants is generally attributed to Arab sailors who traded along the east coast of Africa and often travelled out of sight of land. It soon became more common to take the height of the sun at a given time due to the fact that Polaris disappears south of the equator.

In 1618 English Mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]] further adapted the quadrant with an invention that came to be known as the Gunter quadrant.&lt;ref name=NMAH&gt;{{cite web |title=Gunter Quadrant |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/navigation/type.cfm?typeid=9 |website=National Museum of American History |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pocket sized quadrant was revolutionary because it was inscribed with projections of the tropics, the equator, the horizon and the ecliptic. With the correct tables one could use the quadrant to find the time, the date, the length of the day or night, the time of sunrise and sunset and the meridian. The Gunter quadrant was extremely useful but it had its drawbacks; the scales only applied to a certain latitude so the instrument's use was limited at sea.

==Types==
[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|Tycho Brahe Mural Quadrant 1598, picturing the two clocks.]]
There are several types of quadrants:
*[[Mural instrument|Mural quadrant]]s, used for determining the time by measuring the altitudes of [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]]s of astronomical objects. [[Tycho Brahe]] created one of the largest mural quadrants. In order to tell time he would place two clocks next to the quadrant so that he could identify the minutes and seconds in relation to the measurements on the side of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dreyer |first1=John |title=Tycho Brahe |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-06871-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Large frame-based instruments used for measuring angular distances between astronomical objects.
*Geometric quadrant used by [[surveying|surveyor]]s and [[navigation|navigator]]s.
*[[Davis quadrant]] a compact, framed instrument used by navigators for measuring the [[altitude]] of an astronomical object.

They can also be classified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerard L'E. |last=Turner |title=Antique Scientific Instruments |publisher=Blandford Press Ltd. |year=1980 |isbn=0-7137-1068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horary-quadrant.jpg|thumb|Horary quadrant for a latitude of about 51.5° as depicted in an instructional text of 1744: ''To find the Hour of the Day: Lay the thread just upon the Day of the Month, then hold it till you slip the small Bead or Pin-head'' [along the thread] ''to rest on one of the 12 o'Clock Lines; then let the Sun shine from the Sight G to the other at D, the Plummet hanging at liberty, the Bead will rest on the Hour of the Day.'']]
*'''Altitude''' - The plain quadrant with plumb line, used to take the [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of an object.
*'''Gunner's''' - A type of [[clinometer]] used by an [[Artillery|artillerist]] to measure the elevation or depression angle of a gun barrel of a cannon or mortar, both to verify proper firing elevation, and to verify the correct alignment of the weapon-mounted fire control devices. 
*'''Gunter's''' - A quadrant used for time determination as well as the length of day, when the sun had risen and set, the date, and the meridian using scales and curves of the quadrant along with related tables.  It was invented by [[Edmund Gunter]] in 1623.  Gunter's quadrant was fairly simple which allowed for its widespread and long-lasting use in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Gunter expanded the basic features of other quadrants to create a convenient and comprehensive instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=John |title=A Medieval Gunter's Quadrant? |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin-23iii-Davis.pdf |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=iii |date=September 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishable feature included projections of the tropics, equator, ecliptic, and the horizon.&lt;ref name=NMAH/&gt;
*'''Islamic''' - King identified four types of quadrants that were produced by Muslim astronomers.&lt;ref name=king1987/&gt;
#'''The [[sine quadrant]]''' (Arabic: Rubul Mujayyab) - also known as the "Sinecal Quadrant" – was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations.  It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in 9th century Baghdad and prevalent until the nineteenth century.  Its defining feature is a graph-paper like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead, for calculation, and a plumb bob.  They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes.
#'''The universal (shakkāzīya) quadrant''' – used for solving astronomical problems for any latitude: These quadrants had either one or two sets of shakkāzīya grids and were developed in the fourteenth century in Syria. Some [[astrolabes]] are also printed on the back with the universal quadrant like an astrolabe created by Ibn al-Sarrāj.
#'''The horary quadrant''' – used for finding the time with the sun: The horary quadrant could be used to find the time either in equal or unequal (length of the day divided by twelve) hours. Different sets of markings were created for either equal or unequal hours. For measuring the time in equal hours, the horary quadrant could only be used for one specific latitude while a quadrant for unequal hours could be used anywhere based on an approximate formula. One edge of the quadrant had to be aligned with the sun, and once aligned, a bead on the plumbline attached to the centre of the quadrant showed the time of the day. An example exists dated 1396, from European sources ([[Richard II]] of England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974 |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |author=Clayton Bloom |date=9 November 2011 |website=[[ABC News Online]] |access-date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest horary quadrant was found during an excavation in 2013 in the Hanseatic town of [[Zutphen]] (Netherlands), is dated ca. 1300, and is in the local Stedelijk Museum in Zutphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Davis |title=The Zutphen Quadrant – A Very Early Equal-Hour Instrument Excavated in The Netherlands |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=i |url=http://www.flowton-dials.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zutphen-quadrant-Bull-26i.pdf |date=March 2014 |pages=36-42 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fermin |first=B. |first2=D. |last2=Kastelein |title=Het Zutphense Kwadrant.

#'''The astrolabe/[[almucantar]] quadrant''' – a quadrant developed from the astrolabe: This quadrant was marked with one half of a typical astrolabe plate as astrolabe plates are symmetrical. A cord attached from the centre of the quadrant with a bead at the other end was moved to represent the position of a celestial body (sun or a star). The ecliptic and star positions were marked on the quadrant for the above. It is not known where and when the astrolabe quadrant was invented, existent astrolabe quadrants are either of Ottoman or Mamluk origin, while there have been discovered twelfth century Egyptian and fourteenth century Syrian treatises on the astrolabe quadrant. These quadrants proved to be very popular alternatives to astrolabes.

==Geometric quadrant==
[[File:quadrant.png|thumb|Geometric quadrant with plumb bob.]]
The geometric quadrant is a quarter-circle panel usually of wood or brass.  Markings on the surface might be printed on paper and pasted to the wood or painted directly on the surface.  Brass instruments had their markings scribed directly into the brass.

For marine navigation, the earliest examples were found around 1460.  They were not [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] in degrees but rather had the [[latitude]]s of the most common destinations directly scribed on the [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]].  When in use, the navigator would sail north or south until the quadrant indicated he was at the destination's latitude, turn in the direction of the destination and sail to the destination maintaining a course of constant latitude.  After 1480, more of the instruments were made with limbs graduated in degrees.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=William Edward |title=A History of Marine Navigation |publisher={{nowrap| G. T. Foulis}} &amp; Co. Ltd. |location=Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire |year=1973 |isbn=0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along one edge there were two sights forming an [[alidade]].  A [[plumb bob]] was suspended by a line from the centre of the arc at the top.

In order to measure the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of a star, the observer would view the star through the sights and hold the quadrant so that the plane of the instrument was vertical.  The plumb bob was allowed to hang vertical and the line indicated the reading on the arc's [[Graduation (instrument)|graduation]]s.  It was not uncommon for a second person to take the reading while the first concentrated on observing and holding the instrument in proper position.

The accuracy of the instrument was limited by its size and by the effect the wind or observer's motion would have on the plumb bob.  For navigators on the deck of a moving ship, these limitations could be difficult to overcome.

===Solar observations===
[[File:Back-observation-quadrant.png|thumb|Drawing of a back observation quadrant.  This instrument was used in the manner of a backstaff to measure the elevation of the sun by observing the position of a shadow on the instrument.]]
In order to avoid staring into the sun to measure its altitude, navigators could hold the instrument in front of them with the sun to their side.  By having the sunward sighting vane cast its shadow on the lower sighting vane, it was possible to align the instrument to the sun.  Care would have to be taken to ensure that the altitude of the centre of the sun was determined.  This could be done by averaging the elevations of the upper and lower [[umbra]] in the shadow.

===Back observation quadrant===

In order to perform measurements of the altitude of the sun, a back observation quadrant was developed.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

With such a quadrant, the observer viewed the horizon from a ''sight vane'' (C in the figure on the right) through a slit in the ''horizon vane'' (B).  This ensured the instrument was level.  The observer moved the ''shadow vane'' (A) to a position on the graduated scale so as to cause its shadow to appear coincident with the level of the horizon on the horizon vane.  This angle was the elevation of the sun.

==Framed quadrant==
Large frame quadrants were used for astronomical measurements, notably determining the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of [[Astronomical object|celestial]] objects.  They could be permanent installations, such as [[mural instrument|mural quadrant]]s.  Smaller quadrants could be moved.  Like the similar [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s, they could be used in a vertical plane or made adjustable for any plane.

When set on a [[pedestal]] or other mount, they could be used to measure the angular distance between any two celestial objects.

The details on their construction and use are essentially the same as those of the [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s; refer to that article for details.

Navy:  Used to gauge elevation on ships cannon, the quadrant had to be placed on each gun's trunnion in order to judge range, after the loading.  The reading was taken at the top of the ship's roll, the gun adjusted,and checked, again at the top of the roll, and he went to the next gun, until all that were going to be fired were ready.  The ship's Gunner was informed, who in turn informed the captain...You may fire when ready...at the next high roll, the cannon would be fired.

In more modern applications, the quadrant is attached to the trunion ring or of a large naval gun to align it to benchmarks welded to the ship's deck.  This is done to ensure firing of the gun hasn't "warped the deck."  A flat surface on the mount gunhouse or turret is also checked against benchmarks, also, to ensure large bearings and/or bearing races haven't changed... to "calibrate" the gun.

==Customization==

During the Middle Ages, makers often added customization to impress the person for whom the quadrant was intended. In large, unused spaces on the instrument, a sigil or badge would often be added to denote the ownership by an important person or the allegiance of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Silke Ackermann |last-author-amp=yes |author2=John Cherry |title=Richard II, John Holland and Three Medieval Quadrants |journal=Annals of Science |volume=56 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=3-23 |doi=10.1080/000337999296508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geodesy]], a '''reference ellipsoid''' is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the [[geoid]], the truer [[figure of the Earth]], or other planetary body.
Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which [[geodetic network]] computations are performed and point coordinates such as [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[elevation]] are defined.

In the context of standardization and geographic applications, a ''geodesic reference ellipsoid'' is the mathematical model used as foundation by [[Spatial reference system]] or [[Geodetic datum]] definitions.

== Ellipsoid parameters ==
In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] in which he included a proof&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in Andrew Motte translation, available on line at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA239]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}} that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution which he termed an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroid]]. Current practice&lt;ref name=torge&gt;Torge, W (2001) Geodesy (3rd edition), published by de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3-11-017072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flattening&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. |title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =University of Chicago Press|year=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7 | page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the word 'ellipsoid' alone in preference to the full term 'oblate ellipsoid of revolution' or the older term 'oblate spheroid'. In the rare instances (some [[asteroid]]s and [[planet]]s) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is [[Triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial]] (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-[[GPS]]) ellipsoids are centred at the actual [[center of mass]] of the Earth or body being modeled.

The shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that [[ellipse]] which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The [[semi-major axis]] of the ellipse, ''a'', is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the [[semi-minor axis]] of the ellipse, ''b'', is identified with the [[Geographic pole|polar]] distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the ''inverse ''[[flattening]], {{sfrac|''f''}}, The flattening, ''f'', is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: 
:&lt;math&gt; f=\frac{a-b}{a}. &lt;/math&gt;
For the [[Earth]], ''f'' is around {{sfrac|300}} corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}}. Some precise values are given in the table below and also in [[Figure of the Earth]]. For comparison, Earth's [[Moon]] is even less elliptical, with a flattening of less than {{sfrac|825}}, while [[Jupiter]] is visibly oblate at about {{sfrac|15}} and one of [[Saturn|Saturn's]] triaxial moons, [[Telesto (moon)|Telesto]], is nearly {{sfrac|3}} to {{sfrac|2}}.

A great many other parameters are used in [[geodesy]] but they can all be related to one or two of the set ''a'', ''b'' and ''f''. They are listed in [[ellipse]].

== Coordinates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|Latitude|Longitude}}
A primary use of reference ellipsoids is to serve as a basis for a coordinate system of [[latitude]] (north/south), [[longitude]] (east/west), and [[elevation]] (height).
For this purpose it is necessary to identify a ''zero [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'', which for Earth is usually the [[Prime Meridian]]. For other bodies a fixed surface feature is usually referenced, which for Mars is the meridian passing through the crater [[Airy-0]]. It is possible for many different coordinate systems to be defined upon the same reference ellipsoid.

The longitude measures the rotational [[angle]] between the zero meridian and the measured point. By convention for the Earth, Moon, and Sun it is expressed in degrees ranging from −180° to +180° For other bodies a range of 0° to 360° is used.

The latitude measures how close to the poles or equator a point is along a meridian, and is represented as an angle from −90° to +90°, where 0° is the equator. The common or ''geodetic latitude'' is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference ellipsoid. Depending on the flattening, it may be slightly different from the ''geocentric (geographic) latitude'', which is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the ellipsoid. For non-Earth bodies the terms ''planetographic'' and ''planetocentric'' are used instead.

The coordinates of a geodetic point are customarily stated as geodetic latitude and longitude, i.e., the direction in space of the geodetic normal containing the point, and the height ''h'' of the point over the reference ellipsoid. See [[geodetic system]] for more detail. If these coordinates, i.e., latitude ''ϕ'', longitude ''λ'' and height ''h'', are given, one can compute the ''geocentric rectangular coordinates'' of the point as follows:&lt;ref name="gps-chap10"&gt;{{cite book|title=GPS - theory and practice|author=B. Hofmann-Wellenhof, H. Lichtenegger, J. Collins|isbn=3-211-82839-7|page=282|others=Section 10.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\cos{\lambda} \\
Y &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\sin{\lambda} \\
Z &amp;= \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} N(\phi) + h\right)\sin{\phi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;N(\phi) = \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\phi + b^2\sin^2 \phi }},&lt;/math&gt;
and ''a'' and ''b'' are the equatorial radius ([[semi-major axis]]) and the polar radius ([[semi-minor axis]]), respectively. ''N'' is the ''[[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] in the [[prime vertical]]''.

In contrast, extracting ''φ'', ''λ'' and ''h'' from the rectangular coordinates usually requires [[Iterative method|iteration]]. A straightforward method is given in an [[OSGB]] publication&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain. This is available as a pdf document at

== Historical Earth ellipsoids ==
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
{{Main|Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids}}
Currently the most common reference ellipsoid used, and that used in the context of the Global Positioning System, is the one defined by [[WGS 84]].

Traditional reference ellipsoids or ''[[geodetic datum]]s'' are defined regionally and therefore non-geocentric, e.g., [[ED50]]. Modern geodetic datums are established with
the aid of [[GPS]] and will therefore be geocentric, e.g., WGS 84.

== Ellipsoids for other planetary bodies ==
Reference ellipsoids are also useful for geodetic mapping of other planetary bodies including planets, their satellites, asteroids and comet nuclei. Some well observed bodies such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] now have quite precise reference ellipsoids.

For rigid-surface nearly-spherical bodies, which includes all the rocky planets and many moons, ellipsoids are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the mean surface height excluding any atmosphere. Mars is actually [[Oval (geometry)|egg shaped]], where its north and south polar radii differ by approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=in}}, however this difference is small enough that the average polar radius is used to define its ellipsoid. The Earth's Moon is effectively spherical, having almost no bulge at its equator. Where possible, a fixed observable surface feature is used when defining a reference meridian.

For gaseous planets like [[Jupiter]], an effective surface for an ellipsoid is chosen as the equal-pressure boundary of one [[Bar (unit)|bar]]. Since they have no permanent observable features, the choices of prime meridians are made according to mathematical rules.

Small moons, asteroids, and comet nuclei frequently have irregular shapes. For some of these, such as Jupiter's [[Io (moon)|Io]], a scalene (triaxial) ellipsoid is a better fit than the oblate spheroid. For highly irregular bodies, the concept of a reference ellipsoid may have no useful value, so sometimes a spherical reference is used instead and points identified by planetocentric latitude and longitude. Even that can be problematic for [[convex set|non-convex]] bodies, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], in that latitude and longitude don't always uniquely identify a single surface location.

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

A '''Saxon milepost''' ({{lang-de|kursächsische Postmeilensäule}}, colloquially ''sächsische Postmeilensäule'' or ''Postsäule'') was a [[milepost]] in the former [[Electorate of Saxony]] that gave distances expressed as journey times to the nearest eighth of an hour. With one hour being the equivalent of one [[League (unit)#Comparison table|league]], this corresponds to a distance of about 566&amp;nbsp;m. The design of the mileposts varied according to the distance at which they were placed. They were hewn from natural stone into the shape of an [[obelisk]], an ancient [[herma]] or a [[stele]]. Their prototype was the [[Miliarium|Roman milepost]]. From its German name ''römische Meilensäule'' the rather inaccurate German description of ''Säule'' (lit.: "column") was derived. The Saxon head postal director (''Oberpostdirektor''), Paul Vermehren, brought about their inception based on official distance surveys, whose results were given in [[league (unit)|league]]s on the post mileposts. A league in Saxony at that time (1722 to 1840) was meant to be an hour's journey, equivalent to half a mile or 4.531 kilometres.

Saxon postal mileposts were set up during the reign of [[Augustus II of Poland|August the Strong]] and his successor along all important postal and trading routes and in almost all towns in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to indicate the official distances. This was intended to be the basis for the creation of a unified calculation of postal charges. Because the territory of the Electorate of Saxony was larger than that of the present-day German state of [[Saxony]], these mileposts are nowadays also found in the states of [[Thuringia]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], as well as in [[Poland]].

The locations and images of surviving or replaced Saxon mileposts may be seen in the [[:de:Galerie der kursächsischen Postmeilensäulen|Gallery of Saxon postal mileposts]].

== Forerunners ==
[[File:Hoelzerne Armen Saeulen.jpg|thumb|upright|Wooden Saxon mileposts (''"Chur-Sächßische Hölzerne Armen Säulen"'')]]
In 1695, the head of the Saxon post office, ''Oberpostmeister'' Ludwig Wilhelm, proposed a systematic survey of the road from [[Leipzig]] to [[Dresden]] with wooden, roadside posts at regular intervals. This prompted [[prince elector]] Augustus the Strong, on 18 June 1695, to order ''"that certain mileposts are to be erected"''. He charged the ''Kondukteur'' (building supervisor) Heinrich Niedhart with this task. The Electoral Saxon forestry superintendents were instructed to provide the wood, and the administrators of the electoral Saxon districts were to ensure that the posts were erected.

Furthermore, before 1700 wooden [[fingerpost]]s withs distance markings (so-called ''Arm(en)säulen'' or "arm columns") were commonplace on the roads of Saxony. These consisted of a wooden post, at the upper end of which were direction indicators in the shape of human arms and hands. Because the wood rotted rapidly as a result of its constant exposure to moisture, many of these fingerposts collapsed a few years after they had been erected and became unusable.

The establishment of postal mileposts in electoral Saxony was not an isolated phenomenon. Similar posts or stones with distances marked on them were erected along the roads in a number of countries.

== State survey by Zürner ==
[[File:Lauenstein Museum Schloss (2) 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Working replica of a surveying cart (''Messkarre'') for road surveying in the Eastern Ore Mountain Museum at [[Lauenstein (Altenberg)|Lauenstein Castle]]]]
The basis for the introduction of Saxon mileposts was the [[cartographic]] work of the pastor, [[Adam Friedrich Zürner]], from [[Großenhain|Skassa]]. Zürner had prepared a map of [[Großenhain]], which attracted the attention of Augustus the Strong. After further cartographic work, the prince elector gave him the task on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1713 of: "''recording districts, including the lordships, manor estates, towns, villages and the like, on geographic maps''" (original: "''Aemter samt denen darinnen befindlichen Herrschaften, Rittergütern, Städten, Dörfern und dergleichen mehr in mappas geographicas bringen''"). This entailed the [[topographic]] survey of Electoral Saxony. In addition to the heartland, it covered the electoral Saxon parts of the counties of [[County of Henneberg|Henneberg]] and [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfeld]], the [[House of Schönburg|Schönburg]] estates, the estates of the [[Ernestine and Albertine Wettins|Albertine]] branches of [[Saxe-Merseburg]], [[Saxe-Weissenfels]] and [[Saxe-Zeitz]] as well as the two [[Lusatia]]s.

The resulting cartographic material remained largely secret for several decades for [[military]] reasons. The prince elector only had an improved [[Mail|post]]al map published which was the result of an extension to the contract that followed a few weeks later. This "''Chur-Sächsische Post-Charte''", first published in 1718, and its subsequent editions, remained in use until the 19th century.

Because the distances stated at that time were frequently based on imprecise estimates, Zürner had to survey the distances afresh or verify existing data. To achieve that he designed a survey vehicle in the shape of an electoral Saxon baggage coach. Each revolution of the rear wheel of the coach with a circumference of one Dresden [[rod (unit)|rod]] (''Dresdner Rute''), i.e. 4.531&amp;nbsp;metres, was transmitted to a mechanical [[Counter (digital)|counter]] in the coach by means of a chain. Zürner's assistants used a measuring cart in the shape of a wheelbarrow for those tracks unsuitable for a coach, which likewise measured the distances by the turning of a wheel and which was carried as the so-called "fifth wheel on the wagon" (''fünftes Rad am Wagen'') in a case on the surveying coach. Both methods enabled a very accurate survey of roads.

[[File:Uebersicht Postmeilensaeulen.svg|thumb|Known locations of postal mileposts on a map of the Kingdom of Saxony before the [[Vienna Congress]], whose area of interest coincided largely with that of Electoral Saxony in 1814/15]]
Another problem was the lack of standard units of measurement. At that time there were [[mile]]s (''Meilen'') of various length even within the Electorate. To achieve standardization, the Electoral [[Saxon post mile]] was therefore introduced  on 17&amp;nbsp;March 1722, whereby 1&amp;nbsp;mile = 2&amp;nbsp;leagues = 2,000&amp;nbsp;Dresden&amp;nbsp;rods = 9.062&amp;nbsp;kilometres. To indicate distances on the mileposts, Zürner used the league (''Wegstunde''), which equalled a half mile.&lt;ref name = "Postmeilensaeulen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poststrassen-erleben.de/geschichten/historie-der-postsaeulen.html | title = Historie der Postsäulen | publisher = Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.V. und 1. Sächsischer Postkutschenverein e.V. | language = de | accessdate = 5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey journeys usually began in [[Leipzig]] or [[Dresden]], the counter being set to zero at the [[Post house (historical building)|posthouse]] in each city. As a result, a Leipzig or a Dresden distance is quoted. During such a journey, the assistant to the surveyor had to drive a numbered wooden stake into the ground every quarter of a mile and dig a hole next to it. The excavated material was then used to help fix the wooden post securely. The landowner was responsibility for looking after the survey stake.

In several cases the surveys were also conducted outside the territory of the electorate. Everywhere where Saxon land was interrupted by other territories, roads that were used by the Saxon post office were surveyed, with the permission of the territorial owner.

Surveying was especially difficult in [[Upper Lusatia]] because there the landowners of the [[estates of the realm]] tried to impede Zürner's activity. Zürner was able to begin surveying Upper and [[Lower Lusatia]] only on 29 June 1723. The survey work on the most important roads in the state was completed by 1733.

== Erection of the columns ==
[[File:Canaletto (I) 010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bernardo Bellotto]]: view of Dresden (detail); the moats and bridge between the Wilschem Gate and the template post milepost (without coat of arms) by [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]], ca. 1750]]
On 19&amp;nbsp;September 1721, an Electoral order was issued to the districts (''[[Ämter]]'') of Dresden, [[Meißen]] and [[Amt Hayn (Großenhain)|Großenhain]], to erect stone columns as mileposts. On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1721, this order was extended to the entire state. On the same day the state authorities in charge issued the general ordinance for the "Establishment of Stone Postal Columns" (''Setzung der steinernen Post-Säulen'') and the instruction that the costs of erecting them were to be borne by the landowner of the locations affected. For Upper Lusatia, a separate instruction followed on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1721.

Zürner, who had been tasked by Augustus the Strong on 14 December 1721, worked out himself the details of which mileposts were to be erected. Zürner set forth that a large distance column (''Distanzsäule'') was to be erected immediately in front of the gates of a town. Similarly there were to be quarter-mile, half-mile and whole-mile stones at the corresponding intervals. In the Saxon part of the [[County of Henneberg]] cast iron posts were erected instead of the usual stone columns, and in the [[County of Mansfeld]] there were no mileposts at all.

Originally about 300 distance mileposts and around 1,200 other roadside mileposts were erected. About 200 of them have at least partly survived or have been faithfully reconstructed. Replicas were increasingly made after 1990.

Today the Saxon section of the [[Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road]] is considered the historic transport link with the most surviving postal mileposts.

The material used for the mileposts in Saxony varies widely. They were usually made from the prevailing building stone of the local area, which is also reflected in the building materials used in Saxony's architecture in general. [[Elbe sandstone]] from several quarries in [[Saxon Switzerland]] and the area of the [[Tharandt Forest]] was used for most of the stones. Other frequently used materials were [[Rhyolite tuff|Rochlitz porphyry]] in Central Saxony and [[Lusatian granite]] in eastern Saxony. In the Chemnitz area, Hilbersdorf [[Tuff|porphyritic tuff]] quarried at [[Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf|Hilbersdorf]] and [[Flöha]] was used as a milepost material In the upper [[Ore Mountains]] and the [[Vogtland]] mileposts were made of local [[granite]], for example, [[Thermalbad Wiesenbad|Wiesenbad]] Granite, granite of the [[Greifensteine]] area, [[Rockelmann|Schwarzenberg]] Granite, [[Kirchberg (Saxony)#Geology|Kirchberg]] Granite or [[Kapellenberg (Vogtland)|Bad Brambach]] Granite of the "[[Fichtelgebirge]] type". The different weathering properties of these diverse types of stone proves to be a challenge for the conservation of these monuments in many cases. This is also the reason why numerous mileposts no longer exist.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Herrmann: ''Steinbruchindustrie und Steinbruchgeologie''. 1st ed., Berlin, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
[[File:BGH PM-Säule (7) 2006-07-24.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms and inscription block of the distance milespost in [[Berggießhübel]]]]
Both the costs and the responsibility for erecting the mileposts had to be borne by the authorities of the respective towns and villages. As a result, the measures did not gain universal approval throughout the land. Because the means of the towns varied considerably depending on their size and industrial structure, the financial impact on them was very variable. Regardless of their size, they often had a similar number of town gates and therefore a comparable number of milestone columns to put up. Frequently there were three to five gates. In 1722, the [[Landtag of Saxony|Saxon ''Landtag'']] asked the prince elector to cancel the expensive project that had invoked the opposition of many town councils and landowners. Many towns tried to ignore the edict or delay its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 99, 100, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enforce the implementation of his instructions, the elector had resort to harsh measures and threatened negligence, tardiness or damage to the mileposts with disciplinary action in an order of 24 July 1722; and in another edict of 7 September 1724, fines of 20 talers were imposed against every official guilty of missing deadlines and in each individual case of neglect. Especially on the roads of Central Saxony, in the towns of  [[Colditz]], [[Grimma]], [[Oschatz]], [[Rochlitz]] and [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]], as well as the routes from these towns to Leipzig and thence [[Zeitz]] the gaps were particularly noticeable and were, in a decree of 7 September, subject to public reprimand by the prince elector.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this dispute, many places strove to erect one milepost column only. Zürner knew the location of many small towns and villages very precisely. During the course of his project, he proceeded to support the towns in their requests and advocated the elector's consent. In many cases their requests were granted. On the national roads, therefore, only wooden mileposts were erected or existing ones repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1727 the practice of erecting one column per town was carried out in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the order dated 19 September 1721 incorporated a comprehensive memorandum of 24 items and was accompanied by a list of the benefits of the regulation, it appears that problems had been anticipated from the outset. For example, as advantages of the national survey, the memorandum called pointed out that the payment of ''"delivery men, relay services, postal items and other goods"'' would be verifiable and the prices could no longer be fixed arbitrarily, that there would be fewer complaints from travellers about high fees that had hitherto taken up the time of courts and higher authorities, and that journey times and delivery times would be precisely defined by the survey. Another argument was that the roads would be more easily recognisable in the winter and at night.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the postal mileposts was especially strong in [[Upper Lusatia]]. In 1723, the [[town council]]s of [[Bautzen]] and [[Görlitz]] refused to entertain Zürner in this matter. Not until 31&amp;nbsp;March 1724 did the estates of Upper Lusatia declare themselves ready to carry out the instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because mileposts were occasionally damaged or even knocked down, an order was issued in 1724 that such crimes would be punished by imprisonment and other "hard and exemplary punishments".&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to persistent opposition the Saxon Landtage was finally able to issue a decree on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1728 that - contrary to the Elector's wishes - the mileposts need only be erected on main and postal roads.&lt;ref&gt;Autorenkollektiv: ''Lexikon Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen''. 1989, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:PMS-Arten.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the types of milepost, 1747]]
To what extent Augustus the Strong was personally involved in the development of the designs for the mileposts is not clear. Their final appearance, which was based on [[baroque (architecture)|baroque]] and [[classical antiquity|classical]] prototypes, was linked to the senior state architect (''Oberlandesbaumeister''), [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kursaechsische-postmeilensaeulen.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=68 vgl.

=== Distance mileposts ===
The large distance mileposts (''Distanzsäule'') comprised seven elements.  The [[pedestal]] was formed by the [[plinth]], [[dado (architecture)|dado]] and [[cornice]] (or cap). The column consists of the base (''Zwischenplatte'' or ''Schaftfuß''), the shaft, a block sowing the coat of arms (''Wappenstück''), and the finial (''Aufsatz'' or ''Spitze''). The columns have an average height of 8&amp;nbsp;ells (4.53&amp;nbsp;metres) and rest on a pedestal half an ell high. The individual elements were held together by means of iron pegs cast in lead. On the shaft of the column the names of the destinations were inscribed at Zürner's direction in a [[Fraktur]] font and based on the distance tables that had been worked out for each town. Several routes crossed state borders, and this was indicated by the letters ''gr'' (for ''Grenze'' or "border") or a horizontal line. Part of the inscription on all columns was a [[post horn]] on all four sides, which was the emblem of the state's postal sovereignty. The arms of the Electorate of Saxony with a gilded crown and the Polish royal crown with the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|royal Polish-Lithuanian]] coat of arms were shown on the superstructure.

The mileposts originally erected in front of the town gates usually had the distances marked on two sides and the names of the destination towns on the other two sides. Later columns, erected in the market squares, had the distances marked on all four sides.

=== Full mile stone ===
The full mile stone (''Ganzmeilensäule'') was to mark every full mile along the post road. It is about 3.75 metres high and resembles the large distance milepost in shape. They are however more slender and have no section showing the coat of arms. The information was inscribed on two sides so that travellers in both directions could read them. On the road side was the so-called serial number (''Reihennummer'') with which all roadside columns and mileposts were numbered in sequence. Because a number was assigned every quarter of a mile, each full-milepost had a serial number divisible by four.

=== Half mile stone ===
The half mile stone (''Halbmeilensäule''), also called the league post (''Stundensäule'') because the league corresponded to half a mile, had a lower pedestal surmounted by a shaft that tapered from top to bottom. A roof-shaped, chamfered finial formed the uppermost element. Its total height is about 3 metres. It bore the same inscriptions as the full mile stone. The [[herm]]-like design of this column is a reason why only a few stones of this type have survived until today.&lt;!-- need to find out why --&gt; The serial number is even, but not divisible by four.

=== Quarter mile stone ===
The quarter mile stone (''Viertelmeilenstein'') rests on a low pedestal and consists of a rectangular column or stele. Its total height is about 1.7 metres. There are no inscriptions on these mileposts other than the monogram "AR", a [[post horn]] symbol, the year of manufacture and, on the narrow side facing the road, the serial number which was an odd number.

[[Old weights and measures (Saxony)|Preparations]] for the introduction of the [[metric system]] in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] were made as part of the work of the Standardization Commission (''Normalaichungscommission''), led by Albert Christian Weinlig and Julius Ambrosius Hülße. These two men envisaged a transition phase from the old units. Almost simultaneously, similar efforts were being made at the level of the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Domsch: ''Albert Christian Weinlig.

Upon the full introduction of the metric system around 1900, some of these were converted to kilometer, [[chaussee]], boundary (''Flurgrenz'') and roadkeeper stones (''Straßenwärtersteine'').

'''Society for the History of Discoveries''' (or '''SHD'''), founded in 1960, is an international, [[United States]]-based, organization formed to stimulate interest in teaching, research, and publishing the history of geographical [[exploration]].  Its members include those from several academic disciplines as well as archivists, non-affiliated scholars, and laypersons with an interest in history.  SHD advances its goals by organizing annual meetings at which pertinent scholarly research papers are presented, by publishing a scholarly journal with articles on geographic exploration, and by annually offering an award to student research papers in the field.  The Society is a US [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] organization administered by a voluntary and unpaid team of council members and officers.  Membership is open to all who have an interest in the history of geographical exploration.  It publishes a semiannual journal,  ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/about.htm About SHD].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origin of the Society for the History of Discoveries (SHD) can be traced back to the summer of 1960 at an [[academic conference]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], that commemorated the quincentenery of the death of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]].  American scholars John (Jack) Parker, [[Thomas Goldstein (historian) | Thomas (Thom) Goldstein]], and Vsevolod (Steve) Slesarev, determined that there should be an organization in the United States that would encourage research into the history of exploration and discovery.  Later, in December 1960, Goldstein posted a notice at the [[New York City]] meeting of the [[American Historical Association]] inviting interested parties to meet at a nearby restaurant.  The people who attended that December 1960 luncheon constituted themselves as an executive board for a period of one year, and proceeded to organize SHD.

At the beginning of 1961, there were a total of twenty-one members in the Society.  The appeal of this newly created learned Society was wide. Because there were no barriers to qualify for membership, within a short time historians, geographers, librarians, museum curators, archivists, philosophers, mathematicians, linguists, cartographers, navigators, medical doctors, editors, book sellers, book and map collectors, and independent scholars comprised the membership.  Also, because there were no gender barriers, women scholars readily found a friendly intellectual home, and not only were they among the earliest members attracted to the new Society, they quickly assumed leadership positions.  By 2010, the organization’s membership counted over three hundred people, and numerous institutions subscribe to the Society’s journal, ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/shd_history.htm SHD History].&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members established the major goals to stimulate interest in teaching, research, and publishing the history of geographical exploration. Since its inception, the scope of the Society's activities encompasses the discovery, exploration, and mapping of the earth's land and sea surface from earliest times to the present - the explorers and the explored.  Fields of specialization thus include the history of European expansion, the history of cartography, navigation, colonial settlement, biography, and bibliography.  To further its mission, the Society since 1969 has published annually a journal, ''Terrae Incognitae'', and a newsletter, which since 2000 is titled ''Terra Cognita''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/about.htm About SHD].&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of the Society are archived in Special Collections at The [[University of Texas at Arlington]] Library.

==Organization==

During most of its history, the Society was governed by three elected officers and six members of Council.  The officers were President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer.  In 2006, the by-laws were changed to add another officer. Because the demands on the Secretary-Treasurer had grown, the office of Secretary-Treasurer was divided into two positions, Executive Secretary and Treasurer.  Duties are found at the Society’s Articles of Association, available via the Society website. Council meets formally at the annual meeting, and during the year via email and other technologies.

==''Terrae Incognitae'' and other publications==

The Society for the History of Discoveries determined at its 1966 annual meeting at [[West Point, New York]], to publish an annual journal.  It has become a major part of the Society’s identity, and all agree that the unpaid editor performs the Society’s most difficult and important task.  Bruce Solnick was appointed Executive Editor, and first published by Nico Israel in Amsterdam, the first volume of ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]'' appeared in 1969.  The [[peer-reviewed journal]] was published annually from 1969 through 2010. Beginning in 2011, the journal is published semiannually.  Past and current editors are listed at the Society website.  In addition to scholarly articles, each issue of ''Terrae Incognitae'' includes reviews of recent literature, and since 1979, an extensive bibliography of recent publications related to exploration and discovery.  Beginning in 2008 the editorial board of ''Terrae Incognitae'' extended the number of book reviews to be published in each issue.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/terrae_incognitae/terrae-incognitae.htm Terrae Incognitae]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Commodore [[Pieter Verhoog]] was read by John Parker at the [[Columbus, Ohio]], annual meeting in 1980 which interested those in attendance so much that a special session on the [[Columbus landfall theories|Columbus 1492 landfall]] was scheduled at the next annual meeting in [[Athens, Georgia]].  In addition to focusing on the Columbus landfall at the meeting, John Parker and [[Louis De Vorsey]] were charged with producing a special issue dedicated to the first landfall, and it was published in 1983 as Volume 15.  It was re-published in 1985 by Wayne State University Press as a book titled ''In the Wake of Columbus: Islands and Controversy''.  One important and enduring result of the scholarship represented in Volume 15 was a highly received new translation of Columbus’ ''Diario'' by two Society members, Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, which was published to acclaim by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in 1991.

Beginning in 2010, ''Terrae Incognitae'' is published by Maney Publishing, an independent publisher operating internationally.  Maney produces the journal, both printed hard copies and also, in the future, an online version.  Maney will provide a full back issue archive online for institutional subscribers, and freely searchable electronic abstracts.  When Maney began publication of the journal in 2010, it announced that it would scan and make available in electronic form the back issues to the membership.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/terrae_incognitae/terrae-incognitae.htm Terrae Incognitae]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Terra Cognita''===

Along with ''Terrae Incognitae'', the Society for the History of Discoveries also publishes an annual report each autumn, and 'Terra Cognita', a newsletter in the spring.  These documents, prepared by the Executive Secretary, include Council and business meeting minutes, election results, membership (including a directory) information, reports from committees, abstracts of papers read at the annual meeting, information on upcoming meeting sites, obituaries, various announcements of interest to members, a financial report, and one of the most popular functions, news of members. Periodically, the Society’s Articles of Association are reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/news_letter/terra-cognita_1.htm Terra Cognita]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual Meetings ==

The venues of annual meeting are contingent upon invitations from universities, libraries, maritime museums, map societies, and from organizations familiar with the purpose of the Society. Since 1960, annual meetings usually are held in the Fall, but the 1989 and 1997 meetings were held in the Summer. On several occasions, the Society met jointly with the [[Hakluyt Society]], the [[North American Society for Oceanic History]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/annual-meeting-previous.htm Annual Meetings].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">[[Major-General]] '''Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom, 1st Baronet''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (24 December 1801 – 15 June 1879) was a leading official in the early [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|Irish Ordnance Survey]] that started in 1824. He later became a poor law commissioner, census commissioner and finally executive head of the British administration in Ireland as [[Under Secretary for Ireland|under-secretary]] to the [[Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland]], a position the government of the day was eager for him to take.

The longest-serving under-secretary (1853–1868), and a man of unusual abilities, Larcom had a distinguished career in his adopted country and acted with an impartiality that won him respect from all parties. In 1868 he was admitted to the [[Irish Privy Council]] and created a Baronet.

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

The '''United States Board on Geographic Names''' ('''BGN''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] body operating under the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]]. The purpose of the board is to establish and maintain uniform usage of [[geography|geographic]] names throughout the [[federal government of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://geonames.usgs.gov/publications/docs/November2016_updates/BGN%20Getting%20the%20Facts%20Straight.pdf | publisher=United States Board on Geographic Names | title=The United States Board on Geographic Names: Getting the Facts Straight | date=November 2016 | access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The board was created in 1890 by [[executive order (United States)|executive order]];&lt;ref name="eo28"&gt;{{cite executive order |number = 28 |url = |date = 1890-09-04|language = English |post = President of the United States of America |accessdate = {{date|2017-07-16|dmy}} }}{{wikisource-inline|Executive Order 28|single=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; its present form derives from a law of 1947.

{{Wikisource|1=Executive Order 28}}
On January 8, 1890, [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|T.&amp;nbsp;C. Mendenhall]], superintendent of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] Office, wrote to 10 noted geographers "to suggest the organization of a Board made up of representatives from the different Government services interested, to which may be referred any disputed question of geographical orthography."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; President [[Benjamin Harrison]] signed Executive Order 28 on September 4, 1890, establishing the United States Board on Geographic Names.&lt;ref name="eo28"/&gt; "To this Board shall be referred all unsettled questions concerning geographic names. The decisions of the Board are to be accepted [by federal departments] as the standard authority for such matters."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eo28"/&gt; The board was given authority to resolve all unsettled questions concerning geographic names. Decisions of the board were accepted as binding by all departments and agencies of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

The board has developed principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of domestic and foreign geographic names. It also deals with the names of geographical features underseas&lt;ref name=ACUF&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/acuf.html "Advisory Committee on Undersea Features"] Accessed 2013-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Antarctica]].

Although its official purpose is to resolve name problems and new name proposals for the federal government, the board also plays a similar role for the general public. Any person or organization, public or private, may make inquiries or request the board to render formal decisions on proposed new names, proposed name changes, or names that are in conflict. Generally, the BGN defers federal name use to comply with local usage. There are a few exceptions. For example, in rare cases where a locally used name is very offensive, the BGN may decide against adoption of the local name for federal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/pro_pol_pro.pdf| title=Principles, Policies, and Procedures| author=Donald J. Orth and Roger L. Payne| publisher=United States Board on Geographic Names and Domestic Geographic Names| year=2003| accessdate=July 7, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108233358/http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/pro_pol_pro.pdf| archivedate=January 8, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal mapping and names collection efforts, there is often a phase lag where a delay occurs in adoption of a locally used name. Sometimes the delay is several decades. Volunteers in the Earth Science Corps are used to assist the US Geological Survey in collecting names of geographic features.

The [[Geographic Names Information System]], developed by the BGN in cooperation with the US Geological Survey, includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps which confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded.

The BGN has members from six federal departments as well as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Government Publishing Office]], the [[Library of Congress]], and the [[US Postal Service]]. The BGN rules on hundreds of naming decisions annually and stores over two million geographical records in its databases at geonames.usgs.gov. State and local governments, and private mapping organizations usually follow the BGN's decisions.

The BGN has an executive committee and two permanent committees with full authority: the 10- to 15-member Domestic Names Committee and the 8- to 10-member Foreign Names Committee. Both comprise government employees only. Each maintains its own database.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The BGN does not create a place name, the BGN responds to proposals for names from federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and the public. The BGN does not translate terms, but instead accurately uses foreign names in the Roman alphabet. For non-Roman languages, the BGN uses transliteration systems or creates them for less well-known languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who Decides What Names Go on a Map?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150918-us-board-geographical-names-125th-anniversary-national-geographic-maps-place-names/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-09-19|first = Jeremy|last = Berlin|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED September|last2 = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The BGN currently publishes names on its website. In the past, the BGN issued its decisions in various publications under different titles at different intervals with various information included.&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt; In 1933, the BGN published a significant consolidated report of all decisions from 1890 to 1932 in its ''Sixth Report of the United States Geographic Board 1890–1932''.&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt; For many years, the BGN published a quarterly report under the title ''Decisions on Geographic Names''.&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt;

==History==
The BGN was established in 1890 as the ''Board on Geographical&lt;!-- "Geographical" is correct for the original name --&gt; Names'' and has undergone several name changes.&lt;ref name=Topping&gt;Topping, Mary, comp., ''Approved Place Names in Virginia: An Index to Virginia Names Approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names through 1969'' (Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 1971), v–vi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1934, it was transferred to the Department of the Interior.&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt; The 1969 BGN publication ''Decisions on Geographic Names in the United States'' stated the agency's chief purpose as:

{{quote|[Names are] submitted for decisions to the Board on Geographical names by individuals, private organizations, or government agencies. It is the Board's responsibility to render formal decisions on new names, proposed changes in names, and names which are in conflict. [The decisions] define the spellings and applications of the names for use on maps and other publications of Federal agencies&lt;ref name=Topping/&gt;}}

In 1963, the Advisory Committee on Undersea Features was started for a standardization of names of undersea features.&lt;ref name=ACUF/&gt;

== Other authorities ==
* The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines [[census designated place]]s, which are a subset of locations in the Geographic Names Information System. 
* The names of post offices have historically been used to back up claims about the name of a community. US Postal Service Publication 28 gives standards for addressing mail. In this publication, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] defines two-letter state abbreviations, street identifiers such as ''boulevard'' (''BLVD'') and ''street'' (''ST''), and secondary identifiers such as ''suite'' (''STE'').

The '''Western Australian border''' was originally designated as [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]] (129° east). However, the border marked on the ground is some distance from this line.&lt;ref name=notstraight&gt;{{cite conference | title=An Historical Perspective – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A.

The closest settlement is [[Border Village]], 1,734&amp;nbsp;km to the south on the South Australian side of the border, on [[Eyre Highway]].

==Border delineation==
The Western Australian (WA) border marked on the ground, is not as straight as it looks on a map. The [[Northern Territory borders|Northern Territory border]] with Western Australia and the [[South Australian borders|South Australian border]] with Western Australia are displaced east–west by approximately 127 metres, due to errors within the limits of surveying technology available in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=notstraight /&gt;

Where Western Australia meets the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) and [[South Australia]] (SA) borders is a 127-metre segment running east–west along the [[26th parallel south]] [[latitude]] (26° south).&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

In June 1968, two monuments were erected to mark each end of this 127-metre segment, At the easternmost of these concrete [[Boundary marker|border markers]] all three borders meet, at [[Surveyor Generals Corner]].&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Australia history.gif|right|thumb|250px|Map showing the creation of the colonies/states and mainland territories.]]

===1788–1825===
In 1788 [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] claimed the continent of Australia only as far west as the [[135th meridian east]] (135° east) in accordance with his commission.&lt;ref name="NAA1787"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | title = Governor Phillip's Instructions 25 April 1787 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195616/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | archivedate = 15 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#26 January 1788|26 January 1788 – MAP]])

It has been suggested that the 1788 claim by the British of 135° east was in reference to [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] claims under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].  Spain was seen as no longer having an interest in the area.  On the other hand, the other signatories to the treaty, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] still had a presence in [[Macau]] and [[East Timor]].  Adoption of 135° east as a boundary would minimise provocation of the Portuguese.  By 1825, however, Britain was powerful enough and found it convenient to adopt the original line of the Portuguese under the treaty, 129° east.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web |last = Brown |first = A.

===1825–29===
The line of 129° east first became a border in Australia as the western border of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) in 1825 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#16 July 1825|16 July 1825 – MAP]]).

On 16 July [[1825 in Australia|1825]], the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated at 129° east to take in the new settlement at [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]].&lt;ref name="TaylorP118"&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor

From 1825 to 1829 129° east was the NSW border, except that the settlement of [[King George's Sound]], now [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], was part of New South Wales from its establishment on 26 December 1826, until 7 March 1831 when it was made part of the Swan River Colony.&lt;ref name=srnsw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517;jsessionid=A40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |title=King George's Sound Settlement |work=State Records |publisher=[[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120618/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517%3Bjsessionid%3DA40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1829–32===
Following the settlement of the [[Swan River Colony]] (SRC) in [[1829 in Australia|1829]] ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#2 May 1829|2 May 1829 – MAP]]), the eastern boundary was declared to be 129° east, that is coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time.&lt;ref name="NAA1831transcript"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/wa5i_doc_1831.pdf | title = Transcript of Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | format = pdf| work = Documenting a Democracy  | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swan River Colony, started in 1829, was commissioned as the colony of Western Australia in March [[1831 in Australia|1831]].&lt;ref name="NAA1831"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | title = Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207042047/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | archivedate = 7 February 2008 | df = dmy-all }} found cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1829 to 1832 129° east was the SRC/NSW border.

===1832–46===
The name of the Swan River Colony changed to Western Australia in 1832 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|6 February 1832 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1832 to 1846 129° east was the WA/NSW border.

===1846–47===
In 1846 the colony of North Australia (NA) was proclaimed by Letters Patent, which was all of New South Wales north of 26° south. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#17 February 1846|17 February 1846 – Map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#17 February 1846|Territorial evolution of Australia – 17 February 1846]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1846 to 1847 129° east was the WA/NA border north of 26° south and the WA/NSW border south of the 26th parallel.

===1847–60===
In 1847 the colony of North Australia was revoked and reincorporated into New South Wales. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|15 April 1847 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|Territorial evolution of Australia – 15 April 1847]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1847 to 1860 129° east was once again the WA/NSW border.

===1860–63===
In 1860 South Australia, which had been proclaimed a colony in 1836 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#28 December 1836|28 December 1836 – MAP]]), west to the [[132nd meridian east|132° east]], changed their western border from 132° east to 129° east ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|1860 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1863 129° east was the WA/NSW border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1863–1911===
In 1863 that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia by Letters Patent and became known as the Northern Territory of South Australia (NToSA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|6 July 1863 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 July 1863]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1863 to 1911 129° east was the WA/NToSA border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel

===1911–27===
In 1911 the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) was split off from South Australia to be administered by the Commonwealth. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|1 January 1911 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 January 1911]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1911 to 1927 129° east was the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1927–31===
In 1927 the Northern Territory was split into two territories, [[North Australia (territory)|North Australia]] (NA) and [[Central Australia (territory)|Central Australia]] (CA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|1 March 1927 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 March 1927]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1931 129° east was once again the WA/NA border and WA/CA border, both north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1931–present===
In 1931 North Australia and Central Australia were reunited as the Northern Territory.
([[Territorial evolution of Australia#12 June 1931|12 June 1931 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#12 June 1931|Territorial evolution of Australia – 12 June 1931]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 to the present 129° east has been the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

Fixing the position of the border of Western Australia on the ground has a rich history. In March 1920 the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]], [[H. B. Curlewis]] gave a talk at the WA Museum about the history of the determination of [[longitude]], in relation to using what was at that time a new technology, by using [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] to determine the position of the border between South Australia and Western Australia, as close to the 129th east meridian as possible.&lt;ref name="curlewis-talk"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The other members of the party were Messrs. [[Clive Melville Hambidge]] and J. Crabb, of the Survey Department; Warrant Officer V. D. Bowen, in charge of wireless apparatus lent by the Defence Department; and Mr. C. A. Maddern, of the [[Adelaide Observatory]], all from Adelaide.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concrete piers for the astronomical observing instruments were erected in readiness for the final determinations that were to be held in 1921. Observations were made for the purpose of testing under field conditions the instruments and methods to be used in 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

This expedition, to determine 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved the cooperation of the [[Astronomer Royal]] and the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], with [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the [[:fr:Observatoire de Lyon|Lyons astronomical observatory (Observatoire de Lyon)]] at [[Saint-Genis-Laval]], near [[Lyon, France|Lyons, France]], between 17 and 24 November 1920. Wireless time signals were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide sidereal clock to be used as a control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

After these initial tests a comprehensive program was then arranged for the second stage of the border determinations, which were to take place during the following year and dates were then set for that to happen, from 20 April to 10 May 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

The Deakin Pillar is approximately 2.82&amp;nbsp;km west of the Deakin Obelisk. The Deakin Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of [[1926 in Australia|1926]] to 129° east.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Deakin Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisk, which determines, on the ground, the South Australian border with Western Australia by a line drawn south to the coastline of the [[Great Australian Bight]] and north through this point to 26° south.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

Shortly after the [[1921 in Australia|1921]] determinations of the border of South Australia and Western Australia, the Government Astronomer for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis and party travelled by the [[State Shipping Service of Western Australia|State Ship]] Bambra to the port of [[Wyndham, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;

&lt;!-- Name the other party members? --&gt;
From Wyndham they were guided by [[Michael Durack|Michael Patrick (&amp;quot;M.P.&amp;quot;) Durack]] to a point he perceived as the northern boundary between his [[Argyle Downs]] Station and Jack Kilfoyle's Rosewood Station, which was also Western Australia's border with the Northern Territory or 129° east.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt; Most of Rosewood station is in the Northern Territory but some distance further south Rosewood also extends into the East Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

From the chosen position, two concrete pillars were erected similar to those described above and portable radio masts set up, before the determinations were carried out by the scientists using the same methods of wireless time signals as were used at Deakin.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt;

=====Austral Pillar=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
One of the concrete pillars erected, which was the one used as the point of the determinations, was marked by the expedition party to show how far east of Greenwich they were in hours, minutes and seconds, and became known as the Austral Pillar.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Austral Pillar, the point selected for the scientific determinations of 1921 would later be found to be about 2&amp;nbsp;km east from the border of 129° east on that part of Rosewood Station, therefore inside the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

=====Kimberley Obelisk=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
The Kimberley Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of 1927 to 129° east. Over several weeks during [[1927 in Australia|1927]], a Western Australian [[Surveying|survey]] crew from the WA [[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia|Department of Lands and Surveys]] travelled to Wyndham, then to the Austral Pillar site to set out from that point to the border, where they then erected the much more substantial Kimberley Obelisk.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Kimberley Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top of the concrete obelisk, which officially determines the WA/NT border on the ground, near 129° east, by a line drawn north to the northern coastline near the [[Joseph Bonaparte Gulf]] and south through this point at the Kimberley Obelisk to the 26th parallel.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;
