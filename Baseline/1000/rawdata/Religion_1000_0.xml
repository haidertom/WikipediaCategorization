{{DISPLAYTITLE:"''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''" trial in Russia}}
[[Image:Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Russian).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Color image of the Russian edition of Bhagavad Gita As It Is front cover|The Russian edition of ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'', which was put on trial in [[Tomsk]].]]
The '''''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''''' '''trial in Russia''' was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'' (1968), a translation and commentary of the [[Hindu]] holy text, ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', on charges of [[religious extremism]]. It contains a translation and commentary by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.

The trial was initiated in June 2011 in [[Tomsk, Russia]], based on an assessment of the book by scholars of [[Tomsk State University]], which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as "patently absurd" undertaking of "ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Premier [[Vladimir Putin]] for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for [[India-Russia relations]] and for Russia's international reputation.

In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was included in the 2011 annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]]  of the [[U.S. Department of State]] among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

The court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' commissioned by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]].&lt;ref name=US-DS /&gt; Its authors, three professors of [[Tomsk State University]],  Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that [[Bhaktivedanta Swami]]'s commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' contain "signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction",&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest&gt;{{Cite web|title=Перевод священного писания кришнаитов проверят на экстремизм|trans-title=Translation of the sacred Krishna scriptures to be tried for extremism|url=http://www.ria.ru/inquest/20110831/427685043.html|author=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; and foster "social discord", "gender, race, nationality, and language" discrimination.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt; In addition to this, it was alleged to contain "calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups".&lt;ref name=RIA-inquest /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Первый зам генпрокурора, высказавшийся по суду над "Бхагавад-гитой", недостаточно информирован, считают юристы, участвовавшие в процессе|trans-title=Lawyers: First Deputy Prosecutor General insufficiently informed to comment on the trial of the "Bhagavad-gita"|url=http://www.newsru.com/religy/17feb2012/bhagavad.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=17 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-tomsk&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска подала апелляцию на решение суда о "Бхагавад-гите"|trans-title=The Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal of Tomsk court's decision on the "Bhagavad Gita"|url=http://newsru.com/religy/26jan2012/tomsk.html|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=26 January 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Прокуратура Томска настаивает на экстремистском характере "Бхагавад-гиты" и подала апелляцию|trans-title=The prosecutor's office in Tomsk insists on an extremist nature "Bhagavad Gita" and filed an appeal"|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2012/01/26/n_2180377.shtml|newspaper=[[Gazeta.ru]]|date=January 26, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First, second, and third hearings (August 2011)===

In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt; According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security]] officer Dmitry Velikotsky.&lt;ref name=F18&gt;{{cite news|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=RUSSIA: Has "madness" of banning religious publications been stopped?|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1652|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[Forum 18]]|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite news|last=Попова|first=Анна|title=На поле дхармы|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/21/bhagavadgita/|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' did not contain any extremist statements.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the [[Bible]], like: "Don't throw [[wikt:cast pearls before swine|pearls before swine]]".&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of [[Kemerovo State University]], including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov.&lt;ref name=lenta /&gt; They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not.&lt;ref name=F18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS&gt;{{cite news|author=[[ITAR-TASS]]|script-title=ru:Томский суд отказался признать "Бхагавад-гиту" экстремистской|trans-title=Tomsk court refused to recognize the "Bhagavad Gita" as extremist|date=28 December 2011|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/308329.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.&lt;ref name=TOI-SPD&gt;{{cite news|title=As Hindus rally, Russia court defers Gita verdict|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111230042909/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=20 December 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal (March 2012)===
On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned,&lt;ref name=TOI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/europe/30666187_1_gita-verdict-social-discord-and-hatred-appeal|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIA-APP&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban Only Russian Comment in Hindu Holy Book – Prosecutors |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120216/171341942.html |accessdate=16 February 2012 |date=16 February 2012 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asking for more time.&lt;ref name=ET-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian prosecutors to move higher court seeking Gita ban |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/russian-prosecutors-to-move-higher-court-seeking-gita-ban/articleshow/11640077.cms|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=26 January 2012}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as "extremist literature."&lt;ref name=firstpost1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita verdict: Russian prosecutors planning to file appeal|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/gita-verdict-russian-prosecutors-planning-to-file-appeal-194858.html|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=[[The First Post]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and "semantic distortions."&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;

The prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, "When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond".&lt;ref name=RASPI-APP&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor's office appeals adverse judgment in Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120126/259796779.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=1 February 2012|agency=RASPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal in Bhagavad Gita case to be heard in March|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120214/260191734.html|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=RAPSI (Russian Legal Information Agency)|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later rescheduled for March 20.&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, "it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason." Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, "That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court".&lt;ref name=RIA-APP /&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-proc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/religy/16feb2012/bhagavad.html|script-title=ru:В Генпрокуратуре считают, что дело "Бхагавад-гиты" представляется в обществе искаженно|trans-title=The prosecutor's office believes that the "Bhagavad Gita" case is distorted in the community|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=16 February 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the [[Interfax]] office in Tomsk, [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult]] activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]] stated that the "manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors' complaints in Bhagavad Gita book case legitimate – expert|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9088|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the appeal, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), along with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), stated that they would fight "internationally" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Iskcon to fight against ban attempt on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-23/bhubaneswar/31090291_1_bhagavad-gita-ban-attempts|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Interfax|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal of appeal (March 2012)===
Representative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of "extremism" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.&lt;ref name=Echo-Moskvy&gt;{{cite news|title=Томский суд вновь отказал прокуратуре в запрете книги "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[Echo Moskvy]]|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/870830-echo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsru-mar21&gt;{{cite news|title=Суд в Томске вновь отказался признать экстремистской книгу "Бхагавад-гита как она есть"|date=21 March 2012|author=[[NEWSru]]|url=http://newsru.com/religy/21mar2012/bhagavad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition.&lt;ref name=ITAR-TASS-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDTVxx&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian court dismisses plea seeking ban on Gita|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/russian-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-ban-on-gita-188254|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[NDTV]]|date=21 March 2012|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors won't contest court refusal to declare 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' extremist|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120529/263289348.html|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Russian Legal Information Agency|date=29 May 2012|agency=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, [[Sushma Swaraj]], leader of the largest opposition party [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] demanded that the Indian government declare the ''Bhagavad Gita'' a "national book".&lt;ref name=HT-NB&gt;{{cite news|title=Declare Bhagavad Gita as national book, demands BJP|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Declare-Bhagavad-Gita-as-national-book-demands-BJP/Article1-784744.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, [[Tarun Vijay]], who asked rhetorically  "Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?"&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; Members across party lines voiced their support.&lt;ref name=HT-NB/&gt;  [[Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha]] [[K.

On December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief [[Vijay Jolly]] met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's "pain and anguish" at the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial and demand that "suitable measures" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that "[[India–Russia relations]] is of paramount importance to both countries". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy  a copy of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' to [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of "sublime thoughts" that "preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties".&lt;ref name=Outlook-BJP&gt;{{cite news|title=Take Steps to Withdraw Gita Case: BJP to Russia|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616082341/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=745136|archive-date=16 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in [[Kolkata]], holding up copies of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=Prusty|first=Nigam|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/uk-india-russia-idUKTRE7BI0W620111219|title=Hold India uproar at call in Russia to ban Hindu holy book|work=[[Reuters]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protest marches were held in [[New Delhi]]&lt;ref name=HT-GKG&gt;{{cite news|last=Arora|first=Rajat|title=ISKCON: If Gita is banned, we’ll intensify protest|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=20 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221010708/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Iskcon-If-Gita-is-banned-we-ll-intensify-protest/Article1-785039.aspx|archive-date=21 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chandigarh]].&lt;ref name=TOI-On&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/chandigarh/30537527_1_bhagawad-gita-signatures-petition|title=Bhagawad Gita on trial gathers online support|last=Negi|first=Himanshi|date=December 20, 2011|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]], ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]]er for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, "I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court".&lt;ref name=HT-GKG /&gt;

On December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he  condemned  "Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL&gt;{{cite news|last=Mishra|first=Manjari|title=Darul Uloom Deoband urges Hindus, Muslims to unite on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/india/30546086_1_darul-uloom-deoband-hindus-muslims|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism "totally baseless and highly objectionable",&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt; maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience "enshrined" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the "Russian highhandedness".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;
Maulana Khalid Rashid,  head of [[Firangi Mahal]], another Islamic center of higher education in [[Lucknow]],  also condemned what he called "Russian arrogance" and called on Muslims to support  Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government "to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future".&lt;ref name=TOI-ISL /&gt;

On December 22, 2011,  [[Isai Mahasangh]] organization representing  Christians in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] addressed the [[President of India]] [[Pratibha Patil]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI]], asking for their intervention in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor [[Ram Naresh Yadav]], and to the Pope through the [[Holy See]] embassy in [[New Delhi]]. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that  "the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians".&lt;ref name=Hindu-Chr&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahim Pratap|title=Christians in MP oppose proposed Russian ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2738302.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent Hindu teacher [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]] in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia "an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia" and, countering accusations of the book of "extremism" and "intolerance"  opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.&lt;ref name=DB-NET&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita ban: Outrage grows as sales soar|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/NAT-TOP-bhagvad-gita-ban-outrage-grows-as-sales-soar-2660886.html?HT4=|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu activists====
On December 20, 2011, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad|Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)]] threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary [[Pravin Togadia]] said in a statement that the ''Bhagavad Gita'' is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and "touch humanity so very deeply", citing [[Albert Einstein]]'s fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia.&lt;ref name=AA-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP threatens Russian establishments with retaliation if Gita is banned|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/vhp-threatens-russian-establishments-retaliation-if-gita-banned-632|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Asian Age]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the [[Russian consulate in Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Kates|first=Glenn|title=In Russia, the Bhagavad Gita has a date in court|url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/in-russia-the-bhagavad-gita-has-a-date-in-court/|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VHP and [[Bajrang Dal]] activists also staged protest in [[Chandigarh]], calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of [[Hindus in Russia]] and denouncing the proposed ban.&lt;ref name=DB-VHP&gt;{{cite news|title=VHP, Bajrang Dal protest against bid to ban Bhagwad Gita|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/PUN-NEWS-vhp-bajrang-dal-protest-against-bid-to-ban-bhagwad-gita-2657671.html?LHS-|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar|Daily Bhaskar]]|date=21 December 2011|agency=with [[Press Trust of India|PTI]] input}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, dozens of activists of [[Rashtrawadi Sena]], a hardline Hindu group,  burned a [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in [[New Delhi]] over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the ''Gita'' "the most pious book of the nation" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the ''Bhagavad Gita''  a "national scripture" in order to prevent such insults in the future.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion or extremism?

====Atheists and rationalists====
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], the president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the [[Tarksheel Society]], also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.&lt;ref name=atheist/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dalit]] [[Marxist]] scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheists, rationalists oppose ban on Bhagwat Gita|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-23/news/30550973_1_ban-iskon-bhagwat-gita|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian community in Goa====

On December 21, 2011,  the Russian community in [[Goa]] has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa [[Vikram Varma]] stated: "The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians in Goa flay possibility of ban on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/goa/30545829_1_russian-consulate-russian-city-goa|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Society====
The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from  all over the world, mostly from India.&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;

The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the [[hashtag]] #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-On /&gt;&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; Noted poet and lyricist [[Javed Akhtar]], for instance, twitted: "Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;&lt;ref name=Link&gt;{{cite news|title=Should Bhagavad Gita be India’s National Book?|url=http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=12828|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=The Link|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member of Parilament [[Naveen Jindal]] wrote in his blog, "I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the ''Bhagavad Gita'' controversy".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; [[Janata Dal]] party leader [[Subramanian Swamy]] wrote on Twitter: "Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?"&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt; and  Bollywood celebrity [[Farah Khan]] suggested in a retweet: "The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka".&lt;ref name=DB-NET /&gt;

Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3&gt;{{cite news|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|title=Bhagavad Gita ban:Three views, three solutions|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-debate-bhagavad-gita-ban/20111223.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Rediff News|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A vocal anti-fundamentalist [[Ram Puniyani]] of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita'' translation "irrational",&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;  Former president of the [[Students Islamic Movement of India]] Shahid Badr Falahi said he was "completely against"&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; this or any other bans of religious books, calling on  "equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; [[Ram Madhav]], national executive member of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]  termed the attempted ban "a shameful act"  planned by some "fundamentalist groups in Russia" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a "terror manual".&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt; He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.&lt;ref name=Rediff-3 /&gt;

===In Russia===
The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

====Indian diaspora and ISKCON====
Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide.&lt;ref name=MoscowTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt; On November 1, ISKCON leader in India [[Gopal Krishna Goswami]] appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow.&lt;ref name=HT-NB /&gt;  Hindu followers in Russia from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nepal]] and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the [[Hindu Council of Russia]] meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected [[Sadhu Priya Das]], and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman.  Das said that  they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia,&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt; and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that "finally the truth will prevail".&lt;ref name=STAT-BAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman /&gt;

ISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTx/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNLx /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-reject&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court rejects bid to ban "Bhagavad-Gita"|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/28/tomsk_court_rejects_the_bid_to_ban_bhagavad-gita_14108.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-bilateral&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita in court: Overcoming unexpected roadblock to relationship|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/10/bhagavad_gita_in_court_overcoming_unexpected_roadblock_to_bilateral_14141.html|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholars====
[[Islamic studies]] scholar [[Roman Silantyev]] opined that  Prabhupada's interpretation "has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.&lt;ref name=Interfax-MID&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper&amp;nbsp;– ministry|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8941|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', scientists and members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations."&lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the [[Institute of High Humanitarian Studies]] at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers "have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation".&lt;ref name=RT /&gt;

Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the ''Bhagavad Gita'', which "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism  against Prabhupada's "copious" commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are fallacious and based on a "primitive" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as "fool," "enemy," "demon, "kill"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when  "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy  book to ''Mein Kampf'', should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, "people will again start being burned alive".&lt;ref name=RIR-Vanina /&gt;

Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the ''Gita'' was "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' Volodin replied that "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".&lt;ref name=RIR-Volodin&gt;{{cite news|last=Volodin|first=Andrei|title=Gita row: A test of Russian toleration|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/gita_row_a_test_of_russian_toleration_14077.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government====
In an interview by ''[[CNN-IBN]]'', Russia's ambassador to India [[Alexander Kadakin]] called ''Bhagavad Gita'' "the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world."

He assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the ''Bhagavad Gita'' scandal and added that he thought it "categorically inadmissible" to take any sacred scriptures "for examination to ignorant people" to the courts  rather than to academic forums&lt;ref name=IE-RU&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia expresses sadness over Bhagwad Gita controversy|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/russia-expresses-sadness-over-bhagwad-gita-controversy/889960/0|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=KadTOI /&gt; Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still "can do something" and called the instigators of the trial "madmen", whose "madness should be stopped."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it "has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita."&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt;

On December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban.&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK&gt;{{cite news|title=Krishna discusses Bhagavad Gita row with Russian ambassador|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-27/india/30560871_1_court-in-tomsk-city-bhagavad-gita-nerpa|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 December 2011|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia "to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that "no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court".&lt;ref name=TOI-SMK /&gt;

According to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also "expressed regrets" about the situation.&lt;ref name=Hindu-LS /&gt;

Russian [[Ombudsman|Chief Director]] for [[Human rights in Russia|Human Rights]] [[Vladimir Lukin]] stated that the attempt to ban ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' amounted to "infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness"&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=India asks Russia to drop the case against Gita translation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2731900.ece|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was "unacceptable" to ban the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a "globally respected book".&lt;ref name=Statesman&gt;{{cite news|title=Gita ban: Russian court suspends verdict till 28 Dec|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108011714/http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=393903&amp;catid=36|archivedate=8 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control&lt;ref name=KadCNN /&gt; and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name=TheHindu-MID&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Gita ban: Russia rejects India's complaints|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2741599.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 December 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: "In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C.

The book was translated into Russian in 1984.

Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial "absurd". Speaking on the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'' radio station, she said, "This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years."  She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to "violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith." &lt;ref name=TOI-MAU /&gt;

The court case  evoked protests by US-based [[Hindu]] activists, who called the trial "an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire [[Hindu]] community."&lt;ref name=YahooNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/hindus-upset-bhagavad-gita-ban-attempt-russian-city-095924009.html|title=Hindus upset at Bhagavad Gita ban attempt by Russian city|work= [[Asian News International|ANI]]|publisher = [[Yahoo!

Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors "indefensible" and "a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia".
Shukla added that, "[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society".&lt;ref name=HAF /&gt; HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government "to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens". They also warned that "Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world".&lt;ref name=HAF&gt;{{cite news|last=Jha|first=Lalit K.|title=Hindus in US outraged at attempts to ban Gita in Russia|url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5694646|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=[[MSN News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, [[Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal]], condemned the proposed ban, urging the [[Politics of Nepal|government]] and the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Parliament]] to support the ''Bhagavad Gita''. Chairman of the Dharma Sabha [[Madhav Bhattarai]] also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal.&lt;ref name=HimTimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Dharma Sabha Nepal denounces ban on Gita|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Dharma+Sabha+Nepal+denounces+ban+on+Gita&amp;NewsID=313585|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the ''Gita'' "guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.&lt;ref name=HimTimes2&gt;{{cite news|title='Bhagwat Gita is not extremist literature'|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline='Bhagwat+Gita+is+not+extremist+literature'&amp;NewsID=313597&amp;a=3|accessdate=26 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Himalayan Times]]|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] in its annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]] for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of  "selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom" by the Russian government.

===Scholars===
{{Wikinews|Russian scholars call on Medvedev and Putin to defend Bhagavad Gita}}
On February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference ''Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society'' at the Tomsk State University.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf&gt;{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita case perplex scientists|url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20120224/260445972.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=RAPSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they were "perplexed" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the ''Bhagavad Gita as It Is'' declared extremist. [[Chief researcher]] of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], indologist [[Irina Glushkova]] said in an interview with ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' that there are various schools of Hinduism "and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary", adding that "from this point of view ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office".&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt; She also stated it was "impermissible" to subject the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' to a criminal court trial, because "it is inseparable from the original ''Bhagavad Gita'', both being parts of the same culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Рассматривать "Бхагавад-гиту как она есть" с точки зрения Уголовного кодекса - недопустимо, утверждают ученые|trans-title=Scholars: It's impermissible to view the Bhagavad Gita As It Is via the Criminal Code|url=http://www.interfax-russia.ru/Siberia/report.asp?id=295556|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=24 February 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosopher [[Tatyana Lyubimova]], chief researcher of the [[Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], said that most ancient scriptures, including the ''Bhagavad Gita'', were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[Oriental studies|orientologists]], and [[philology|philologists]] published an open letter addressing both [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] and [[President-elect]] [[Vladimir Putin]], with copies sent to Russia's [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Presecutor General]], [[Ministry of Justice of Russia|Ministry of Justice]], and [[Public Chamber]], urging the ruling tandem to take the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' court case under their "personal control".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20&gt;{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Russian scholars' plea on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2999643.ece|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsru-20&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Российские ученые просят Медведева и Путина взять процесс над "Бхагавад-гитой" под личный контроль|trans-title=Russian scholars ask Medvedev and Putin to take "Bhagavad Gita" court case under their personal control|url=http://newsru.com/religy/15mar2012/bhagavad.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=15 March 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as "untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Bengali Vaishnavism]], "one of the most popular branches of Hinduism",&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; and "did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt; The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial "discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations".&lt;ref name=Hindu-20 /&gt;

===ISKCON===
Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]], said that the commentary to ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' is "a precise and clear reflection" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-[[acharya]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.&lt;ref name=RAPSI-Conf /&gt;

On April 11, 2012 [[Vladimir Lukin]], the [[Human Rights]] [[Commissioner]] of Russia, "warned against court decisions on ''Bhagavad Gita'' texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations." Lukin stated that the "Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s."

====Religions====
On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council [[Roman Silantyev]] said that the examination of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' as extremist was accurate, and that "it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism."

He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with "extremely nasty reputation" and condemned their [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|charitable food distribution programs]] saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.&lt;ref name=IFSil&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomsk court didn't find "Bhagavad Gita" translation extremist|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8953|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=28 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a "destructive cult" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It''.  [[Mufti]] Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, 
"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to "pay the debt" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable  food distribution by "delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites".&lt;ref name=IF-Mus&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Muslims believe Krishnaites a sect and ready to deliver them Halal meat|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8986|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=18 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Siberian prosecutors make another attempt to ban Prabhupada’s Gita interpretation|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/26/siberian_prosecutors_make_another_attempt_to_ban_prabhupadas_gita_in_14630.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Russia &amp; India Report|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as "fortunately" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.&lt;ref name=RIR-Appeal /&gt;

On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', which they called an "anti-Russian … disgraceful act" and "one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orthodox believers conveyed a batch of tinned stewed meat to Moscow Krishnaites in protest against burning Russian flag|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9015|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is "misinformed" and "exerting pressure" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because "there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet".&lt;ref name=IF-Bud&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:В буддийской общине РФ выступают против строительства храма кришнаитов в Москве|trans-title=The Buddhist community of Russia spoke against the construction of Krishna temple in Moscow|url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=44000|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Mathematician's Apology.pdf|thumb|Full text of the "A Mathematician's Apology" by G. H. Hardy.]]

'''''A Mathematician's Apology''''' is a 1940 essay by British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].  It concerns the [[Mathematical beauty|aesthetics of mathematics]]  with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working [[mathematician]].

==Summary==
[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|left|In ''A Mathematician's Apology'', [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty.]]
In the book's title, Hardy uses the word "[[Apologetics|apology]]" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.

Hardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, [[C. P. Snow]] describes the Apology as
"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again".
In Hardy's words, "Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done."

Secondly, at the start of the [[World War II]], Hardy, a committed [[pacifist]], wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an [[atheist]], and makes his justification not to [[God]] but to his fellow man.

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ([[pure mathematics]]) and, in particular, his own special field of [[number theory]].  Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.  He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very "uselessness" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm.  On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the [[applied mathematics]] as either being "trivial", "ugly", or  "dull", and contrasts it with "real mathematics", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.

Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] that "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the "queen of mathematics" because of that. What [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a "young man's game", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
[[File:MathematiciansApology.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Cambridge University Press]])]]

Hardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the [[academia|academic]] culture of the universities of [[Cambridge]] and [[Oxford]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Some of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years." Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/jborwein/apaper.pdf|title=Experimental mathematician Jonathan Borwein's comments on the Apology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of [[Euclid's theorem|the infinitude of primes]] and of [[Square root of 2|the irrationality of the square root of two]]) still hold up.

The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.

He considers that [[Rolle's theorem]] for example, though it is of some importance for [[calculus]], cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by [[Évariste Galois]] and other pure mathematicians.

The '''Absolute Infinite''' (''symbol'': Ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]].

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal
 | author=Ignacio Jané
 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set

 | volume=42 | issue=3 |date=May 1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/BF01129011 | quote=Cantor (1) took the absolute to be a manifestation of God [...] When the absolute is first introduced in Grundlagen, it is linked to God: "the true infinite or absolute, which is in God, admits no kind of determination" (Cantor 1883b, p. 175) This is not an incidental remark, for Cantor is very explicit and insistent about the relation between the absolute and God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: New Research and Frontiers'' by Michael Heller and W. Hugh Woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor said:

{{quote|The actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extraworldly existence, in Deo, where I call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. In the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, I call it ''[[Transfinite number|Transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf&lt;br/&gt;Translated quote from German: {{quote|Es wurde das Aktual-Unendliche (A-U.) nach drei Beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten Vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen Sein, in Deo realisiert ist, wo ich es Absolut Unendliches oder kurzweg Absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen Welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische Größe, Zahl oder Ordnungstypus vom Denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. In den beiden letzten Beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer Vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem Endlichen verwandtes A.-U. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''Transfinitum'' und setze es dem Absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[Ca-a, p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, {{ISBN|3-540-09849-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1962, pp. 443–447; translated into English in ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', ed. Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

'''Agni Yoga''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Агни Йога'') or the '''Living Ethics''' (Russian: ''Жива́я Этика''), or the '''Teaching of Life''' (Russian: ''Учение Жизни'') is a one of the [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-theosophical]] [[religious doctrine]] transmitted by the [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] from 1920. The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of Roerichs and [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the [[Theosophical Society]]. 

Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the [[yoga]] of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the [[planetary consciousness]] is a pressing necessity and that, through [[Individual#Buddhism|individual]] striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of all [[yoga]]s. In all the [[List of Hindu texts|ancient Hindu scriptures]], the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire [[baptism]].

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and [[universalism]]. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the [[Universe]].

Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of [[Asian religions]] to [[Western world]]. Living Ethics has an international following and  has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another [[esoteric]] movements and philosophies, among them the [[New Age]] and [[Transhumanism]].

==Birth of the new religion==

===Etymology and concept===
The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html |title=Agni Yoga |publisher=highest-yoga.info |accessdate=21 November 2018 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/746J1WitJ |archivedate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Agni]]'' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and Living Ethics ''God of Fire'', one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the [[Rigveda]]. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of  the "Fire of Space"; and "psychic energy", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |author=[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] |title=World Religions |publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc. |accessdate=10 September 2018 |year=1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wJMDtNzh?url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |archivedate=8 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin myth found in many [[Indo-European culture]]s Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to [[Earth]]. In the early [[Vedic literature]], Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p15"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=Vedic Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |pages=15–16, 92–93 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yoga]]'' ({{lang-sa|योग}}; {{pronunciation|Yoga pronunciation.ogg |help=no}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. Yoga is a group of [[soul|spiritual]], [[mind|mental]], and [[Human body|physical]] practices or disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]]. The term ''Yoga'' has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]]. The term ''[[Rāja yoga]]'' originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is [[Samadhi]] ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|समाधि}}, {{IPA-hns|səˈmaːdʱi|hi}}), but was popularised by [[Swami Vivekananda]] as the common name for ''Ashtanga Yoga''. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, ''Samadhi'' is the eighth and final limb identified in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name="Feuerstein2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georg Feuerstein]] |title=The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI5XDwAAQBAJ |date=23 October 2012 |publisher=Hohm Press |isbn=978-1-935387-39-8 |page=37 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yogadarsanabook3&gt;{{cite book |url=

''[[Karma]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in [[History of India|ancient India]]'s [[Vedic civilization]], the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |publisher=books.google.com |pages=5–7 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action. ''When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the Infinite are thus being built'', written in the Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |title=Infinity Part II, 159 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1930 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73L93b1d9?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |archivedate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Spiritual evolution]]'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |GbWMw249xY8 |The Hidden History of Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of ''higher evolution'', a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the ''lower evolution'' or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
{{Main|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] was officially formed in [[New York City]] on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. It was self-described as "an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity." After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]], in [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Theosophical_Movement.html?id=OC4IAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |year=1951 |title=The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950 |publisher=Cunningham Press |location=Los Angeles |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madame Blavatsky (''Upasica'' - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the ''Teachers'' called [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|HPB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Theosophy and culture: Nicholas Roerich |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdpG8sGt8K8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Stasulane, Anita |publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop |location=Rome |volume=8 |year=2005 |page=26-27 |isbn=978-88-7839-035-5 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the greatest [[occultist]] in the history of [[Western civilization]], insisted that [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is not a [[religion]], although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: '''There is no Religion higher than Truth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ultindia.org/tm_magazine/TMOct2018.pdf |title=The motto is located at the top of the magazine page |journal=The Theosophical Movement.

Theosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in [[Theosophists]] who also identify as [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], or [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books/about/Is_Theosophy_a_Religion.html?id=2Kd5ngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y |last=Blavatsky |first=Helena |year=2013 |title=Is Theosophy a Religion? |pages=24 |isbn=9781258977719 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Neo-Theosophy]] was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/ |title=Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy: Margaret Thomas' Study of C.

Other neo-theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]]. [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include [[Benjamin Creme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |author=[[Benjamin Creme]] |title=Transmission A meditation for the New Age |publisher=share-international.org |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73hqv2NN3?url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Skumin]]. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of [[spiritual evolution]], proposed a classification of '''Homo spiritalis''' ([[Latin]]: ''Spiritual man''), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): ''HS-0'' Anabiosis spiritalis, ''HS-1'' Scientella spiritalis, ''HS-2'' Aurora spiritalis, ''HS-3'' Ascensus spiritalis, ''HS-4'' Vocatus spiritalis, ''HS-5'' Illuminatio spiritalis, ''НS-6'' Creatio spiritalis, and ''HS-7'' Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=V.

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. ''Slavophilia'' was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed [[Slavophobia]], a fear of [[Slavic culture]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Slavophile  Russian history |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jPhqyh2?url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavophile |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]].In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[religion]], and [[Russian cosmism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Red-Cosmos-Tsiolkovskii-Grandfather-Centennial/dp/1603441174 |author=James T.

Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity ''Sophia'' in his works, such as ''Three Encounters'' and ''Lectures on Godmanhood''. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian [[Slavophiles]]' concept of [[sobornost]]. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] art movements of his time. His teachings on ''Sophia'', conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew [[Shekinah]] or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a [[heresy]] by [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] and as unsound and unorthodox by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |title=The Sophian heresy and attempts to feminize God |publisher=ecumenizm.tripod.com |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jQWHmoo?url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] was a [[Russian Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of [[evolution]], as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the ''Common Cause''. Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving [[immortality]] and revival is the greatest goal of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1915_186.html |author=[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] |title=The religion of resuscitative resurrection The "Philosophy of the Common Task" of N.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[Herbert Wells]] as well as philosophical movements like [[Russian cosmism]]. In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the [[Russian Empire]], but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of [[Interplanetary spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA26 |author=A.

He believed humans would eventually colonize the [[Milky Way]]. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |last=[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]] |first=Konstantin Eduardovich |title=The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces |place=[[Kaluga]] |publisher=The author's edition |year=1928 |pages=23 |language=Russian |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jR4GDrr?url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and [[Rerikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2013 |url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013 |title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

Information about [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]] spread in [[Western countries]] in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over [[fundamentalism]] and [[modernism]] as the only available choice, and long before [[Shangri-La]] had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Taves |year=1985 |title=Philosophy Into Popular Fiction: Talbot Mundy and The Theosophical Society |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41171147?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |journal=Southern California QuarterlyTo |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=153-186 |doi=10.2307/41171147 |issn= |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qsRpCDp?url=http://scq.ucpress.edu/content/67/2/153 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended Masters]]. They are referred to by [[theosophist]]s as Elder Brothers of the human race, [[Adept]]s, [[Mahātmā]]s, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Blavatsky]], after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=TI6fAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+myth+of+the+Masters+revived&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY0bbboKTeAhWOhqYKHY0ABHMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20myth%20of%20the%20Masters%20revived&amp;f=false |title=The myth of the Masters revived: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Elena Roerich |publisher=books.google.ru |isbn=978-90-04-27043-5 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers.

When Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |title=When Helena Roerich called Kalimpong home |author=Ajay Kamalakaran |publisher=Russia beyond |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtOgEyJ?url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York===
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building ''[[Master Apartments]]''. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |title=AGNI YOGA (Sacred Heart Fire) AGNI YOGA The Great Synthesis |publisher=agniyoga.us |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtsQePo?url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a ''Living ethic''. 
Speaking about the role of [[personality]] in the [[spiritual evolution]] of mankind, [[Helena Roerich]] wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html |title=The Spiritual Work of the United Nations and the Liberation of Humanity Creating Fundamental Global Transformations through the Power of Thought |publisher=aquaac.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qu54znq?url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html  |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |title=Letters of Helena Roerich II, 25 October 1936 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=25 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6p2OJSzbs?url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

True, it is impossible to increase our store of psychic energy without the help of the Teacher; however if our hearts are open and purified, and if our organism permits it, the Teacher will not tarry in manifesting himself''.}}

===Latvian Roerich Society in Riga===
The [[Latvia]]n Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in [[London]], met  Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In [[Riga]] they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to [[India]], to become the secretary of Roerich.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |title=In short about Latvian Roerich Society |publisher=latvijasrerihabiedriba |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73quP4eRE?url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by [[Doctor (title)|doctor]]-[[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[:lv:Fēlikss Lūkins|Felix Lukin.]] [[Dr.]] Felix Lukin and his son Dr. [[:lv:Haralds Lūkins|Harald Lukin]] conducted [[clinical trials]] are many natural [[medication]]s that they received from [[Svetoslav Roerich]] of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-0B1OWsbIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=Feliks+Lukin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9sr1G3-LjI&amp;sig=BOFxH1ypWEF0Mff4E_p4yCgnFWc&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikrLTm8JbeAhUFposKHVn1DlA4ChDoATAFegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Feliks%20Lukin&amp;f=false |title=History and status of homoeopathy around the world |author=Aswarda Das |publisher=books.google.com |isbn=81-8056-573-4 |year=2005 |pages=144-147 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 [[:lv:Rihards Rudzītis|Rihard Rudzitis]] officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, [[Helena Blavatsky]]’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs [[Banner of Peace]]. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the [[USSR]] who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the [[Republic of Latvia]].&lt;ref name="la"/&gt;

===Master Institute of United Arts in New York City===
Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in [[New York City]] in 1921:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |title=Inspired By Art: Nicholas Roerich’s Symbolic Journey |publisher=philosophicalsociety.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qumopSR?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Art will unify all humanity. Art is one – indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one.  Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all''.}}

Mr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the [[Master Apartments]], designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6636038/ |title=Louis L. and Nettie S.

Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as [[George Bellows]], [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], [[Norman Bel Geddes]], [[Stark Young]], [[Deems Taylor]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]], and [[Lee Simonson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |title=Nicholas Roerich Biography America |publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qvhsopy?url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were [[Felix Salmond]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Michael Fokin]]. In the ''Institute of United Arts in New York City'' also taught [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Claude Bragdon]], [[George Bellows]], and [[Norman Bel Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich-izvara.ru/eng/museum/roerich-and-america-13.htm

Some contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the Artist are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |title=Tag Archives: Master Institute of United Arts |publisher=The Masonic Philosophical Society |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qwQmTGL?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich's family moved to [[India]] in December 1923. They settled in [[Darjeeling]], a town in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |title=Roerich Himalayan Museum Of Folk And Tribal Art |publisher=ignca.gov.in |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qx6ANWT?url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a [[Central Asia]] expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of [[India]], [[China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. [[Sikkim]] was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as [[history]], [[archeology]], [[ethnography]], [[history of philosophy]], [[arts]] and [[religions]], and [[geography]] was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]''. She also wrote a book named "Chalice of the East", which was published under the pen name "Iskander Khanum". Helena Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], where her expedition was staying at the time.

The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati'' in [[Darjeeling]] in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to [[Naggar]] in [[Kulu Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/nagar-himachal-pradesh-india-interior-of-the-roerich-estate-museum-where-the-russian-artist-philosopher-and-traveller-nicholas-roerich-settled-i-image183921077.html |title=Nagar, Himachal Pradesh, India : Interior of the Roerich Estate museum, where the Russian artist, philosopher and traveller Nicholas Roerich settled |publisher=alamy.com |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qyyMq3k?url=https://www.alamy.com/nagar-himachal-pradesh-india-interior-of-the-roerich-estate-museum-where-the-russian-artist-philosopher-and-traveller-nicholas-roerich-settled-i-image183921077.html |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City}}

The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)]], which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent  two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/journeys-specialty-museums-finding-art-not-crowds-in-new-york.html |date=16 April 2006 |author=Seth Kugel |title=JOURNEYS: SPECIALTY MUSEUMS; Finding Art, Not Crowds, in New York.

Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Kyo03NxncC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Nicholas+Roerich+Museum%22&amp;ei=CfWySJWGBIyuyAT-uKz-Bg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VaGGP0xsNuixcSHcUcdMEJCcA3g |title=Spiritual Places| last=Squires| first=Emily| authorlink=Emily Squires |author2=Len Belzer |year=2000| pages=86 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=1931044031 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these Roerich's ideas is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php?mid=about_en |title=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |publisher=roerich.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j1nfmzWO?url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and [[Cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=17 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pms1o0eG?url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |publisher=en.icr.su |archivedate=17 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The World Organisation of Culture of Health ('''WOCH''')'' — International [[Social movement organization|social movement]] ''To Health via Culture'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. [[Victor Skumin]] was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation]] Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |title=Charter of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Russian: Устав) |publisher=Kult-zdor.ru |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6poMifaLN?url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |archivedate=18 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book ''Supermundane'' (paragraph 525) recorded the words of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]], addressed to Urusvati,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |title=Supermundane, 525 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ATQDcyS?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Urusvati knows that people are responsible for three aspects of health. First, their own health; second, the health of the planet; and finally, the health of the Supermundane World... People must safeguard their own health, not only for themselves but also for those around them. The human organism, though seemingly small, is a powerful repository of energy, and truly dominates its earthly environment''.}}

It is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=5 |author=Victor A.

The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Aum.php |title=Aum, §3 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1936 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ASzqsWl |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]], the culture  – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii |last2=Lobanova |first2=N.A. |last1= Verhorubova |first1=O.V. |title= Многообразие определений феномена "культура здоровья" как показатель его многогранности в педагогическом образовании |trans-title=The diversity of definitions the phenomenon of "culture of health" as an indicator of its versatility in education |journal=Вестник Томского государственного педагогического университета |year=2012 |issue=5 |pages=161–5 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKKxNxWb |archivedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/ibmcnepal/videos/vb.242290825944809/670365706470650/?type=2&amp;theater] |title=International Buddhist Meditation Centre |publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anthem]] of WOCH (''To Health via Culture'') consists of four [[stanzas]]. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word [[Agni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Молитвы, гимны, притчи Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Culture of Health: prayers, hymns, parables |year=2002 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-018-3 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcES03C?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gimns of Culture of Health"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Гимны Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Gimns of Culture of Health |year=2007 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |language=Russian |isbn=978-5-88167-030-6 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcoqT4R?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{YouTube|kyknqmZhyIk|''Anthem "To Health via Culture."''}}).

[[Helena Roerich]], known as the ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Urusvati'' in Agni Yoga and [[Rerikhism]]. This anthem begins with the phrase, "The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace".

{{distinguish|Alatri|Alastrim}}
'''Alatrism''' or '''alatry''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + λατρεία (''latreia'') = [[worship]]) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no [[supernatural]] significance, and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.

Alatrism is not the same as [[Deism]], which holds that one or more gods may exist, but do not intervene. Deism does not exclude worship, and alatrism does not exclude the possibility that gods intervene; alatrists usually believe that any divine intervention occurs only for the deity's/deities' own reasons, unconnected to any encouragement by devotees.

Historical alatrist groups include the [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreans]].

[[File:ARO Plate 2 (Title page alternate).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|One of two known impressions of the title page from ''All Religions are One'', printed ''c''1795]]
'''''All Religions are One''''' is a series of philosophical [[aphorism]]s by [[William Blake]], written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with [[William Blake#Relief etching|relief etching]] in the non-textual ''[[The Approach of Doom]]'' (1787), ''All Religions are One'' and ''[[There is No Natural Religion]]'' represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his [[illuminated manuscript]]s. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as [[Peter Ackroyd]] points out, "his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words [[Epigraphy|inscribed]] like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 115–16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief etching==
[[File:The Ghost of Abel (page 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Page 2 of ''The Ghost of Abel'' (1822); note the writing in the colophon at bottom right.]]
In 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled ''[[The Ghost of Abel|The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake]]''. Inscribed in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of this text is "W Blakes Original [[Stereotype (printing)|Stereotype]] was 1788". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the "Original Stereotype" to which he here refers was ''All Religions are One'' and/or ''There is No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bindman (1978: 468), Erdman (1982: 790); Ackroyd (1995: 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would [[Engraving|engrave]] it (the engraver), another [[Printing|print]] it (the printer) and another [[Publishing|publish]] it (the publisher).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 10)&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the [[social status]] attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; Artists like [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with [[James Basire]] during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was [[stippling]], which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, [[line engraving]]. [[Etching]] was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (1978: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; All traditional methods of engraving and etching were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a [[burin (engraving)|burin]] to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of [[Hatching|crosshatched lines]], before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''. Around the same time, [[George Cumberland]] had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern [[rubber stamp]]. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.&lt;ref&gt;See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information.&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he [[Mirror writing|wrote in reverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"/&gt;

Blake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire ''oeuvre'' are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.

Blake himself referred to relief etching as "printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790); Plate 6&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|J.T. Smith]]; "writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with [[Nitric acid|aquafortis]] considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief etching was the same basic method used for [[woodcut]]ting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by [[Elisha Kirkall]], but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"&gt;Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (2000: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; "it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake served as artist, engraver, printer ''and'' publisher.

==Copy==
Although ''All Religions are One'' was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed ''All Religions'' prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion'', would suggest he had not.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003052150/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2006 |title=Introduction |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copy A is located in [[Huntington Library|The Huntington Library]], except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the [[Geoffrey Keynes]] Collection in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

''All Religions are One'' comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 21)&lt;/ref&gt; with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and [[Wash (painting)|wash]], often touching the text and design outlines with pen.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"/&gt; Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of [[Woodcut#White-line woodcut|white line engraving]], a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.

The black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to [[John Linnell]]. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro" /&gt; It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27&amp;nbsp;cm.).&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt;
 
Plates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from ''There is No Natural Religion''. The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to [[Henry E. Huntington]]. Plate 2 was acquired by [[George A. Smith]] in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by [[William Muir]], but was ultimately sold at [[Sotheby's]] by Sir [[Hickman Bacon]] on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/aro.a |title=Copy Information |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original 1795 printing, the text of ''All Religions'' was not published again until 1893, in ''The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical'', edited by [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] and [[Edwin Ellis (poet)|E.J. Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1966: 886)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Until 1971, most editors tended to consider ''All Religions are One'' as later than ''There is No Natural Religion''. For example, in his 1905 book ''The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals'', [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] places ''No Natural Religion'' prior to ''All Religions'' in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that ''All Religions are One'' was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its "greater technical imperfection."&lt;ref name="Erdman (1982: 789)"&gt;Erdman (1982: 789)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1978 book, ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'', David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in ''All Religions'' are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 468)&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars however support Keynes, and ''All Religions are One'' precedes ''There is No Natural Religion'' in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, [[Alicia Ostriker]]'s ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), [[David V. Erdman]]'s 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), even Bindman's own ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

Further evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of ''No Natural Religion'' as more confident than that of ''All Religions''. They especially cite the use of upright [[Latin alphabet|roman lettering]] in ''All Religions'' contrasted with the [[Italic script|italic]], [[cursive]] writing on several plates of ''No Natural Religion''; "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of ''No Natural Religion'', a script which he would use throughout the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; Other evidence for an earlier dating of ''All Religions'' is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in ''No Natural Religion''. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in ''All Religions'' but not ''No Natural Religion'' suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.

==Content==
When analysing ''All Religions are One'' it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; "the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake would go on to criticise the ten commandments in later work such as ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790), ''[[The Book of Urizen]]'' (1794), ''[[The Book of Los]]'' (1795) and ''[[The Song of Los]]'' (1795), and that same critical inclination seems present here as he quite literally effaces the content of the original tablets, replacing it with his own doctrine. However, it is also worth noting that the angel embraces the man with his left hand and the tablets with his right, thus suggesting a spiritual union between the man of prophecy (Blake himself) and the foundational text of orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 34)"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The central concern in ''All Religions are One'' is the notion of the "Poetic Genius", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and "is the true man." The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as "The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel &amp; Spirit &amp; Demon." Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; "as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius." Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; "all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; "the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy," again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; "The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius." Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.

David Bindman classifies ''All Religions are One'' as "a rather abstract dialogue with conventional [[theology]],"&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with [[deism]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ostriker (1977: 877), Bindman (1978: 468), Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894) or Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Northrop Frye]] argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a "visionary tolerance" at odds with the "rational tolerance" of deism "which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 345)&lt;/ref&gt; Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake "set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sandler (1990: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a "mockery of [[rationalism]] and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude."&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker (1977: 877)&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Foster Damon]] suggests that what Blake has done in ''All Religions are One'' is "dethroned [[reason]] from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 343)&lt;/ref&gt; Damon also argues that "Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the "primacy of the poetic imagination over all [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and moral systems."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that "the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or "[[Natural theology|natural religion]]", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or "Poetic Genius"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/staticpage/biography?p=biography |title= Illuminated Printing and other Illustrated Books, 1789-1792 |author= Denise Vultee  |date= |work=William Blake (1757-1827) |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 [[Henry Fuseli]] was working on a translation of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|J.C. Lavater]]'s ''[[Aphorisms on Man]]'' for the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 107)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of ''Aphorisms'', and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hilton (2003: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16–17)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Know, in the first place, that mankind agree in essence, as they do in their limbs and senses.
# Mankind differ as much in essence as they do in form, limbs, and senses – and only so, and not more".

To these points Blake has annotated "This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction."

Another work which may also have influenced him is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word "Lord" with "Poetic Genius". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes "He who Loves feels love descend into him &amp; if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord." Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's "the negation of God constitutes Hell", Blake annotates "the negation of the Poetic Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Both quotations taken from Erdman (1982: 603)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated ''The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Blake wrote

{{quote|[[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Treatise on the Sublime &amp; Beautiful]] is founded on the Opinions of Newton &amp; Locke on this Treatise Reynolds has grounded many of his assertions. in all his Discourses I read Burkes Treatise when very Young at the same time I read Locke on [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Human Understanding]] &amp; Bacons [[The Advancement of Learning|Advancement of Learning]] on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions &amp; on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar. I felt the Same Contempt &amp; Abhorrence then; that I do now. They mock Inspiration &amp; Vision Inspiration &amp; Vision was then &amp; now is &amp; I hope will always Remain my Element my Eternal Dwelling place. how can I then hear it Contemnd without returning Scorn for Scorn}}

Harold Bloom also cites the work of [[Anthony Collins]], [[Matthew Tindal]] and [[John Toland]] as having an influence on Blake's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Blake's Apocalypse'' (Garden City: Doubleday,  1963), 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a more general sense, "Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 27)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Blake "manipulates the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] mythology of [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Paul Henri Mallet]], and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"/&gt;

In relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; W.H. Stevenson calls them "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2007: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of ''All Religions'', in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' (1790), he writes "the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative" (12:22–24).

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

[[Image:Catrina-sculpture.jpg|right|thumb|A ''calaca'' of [[La Calavera Catrina]].]]
A '''calaca''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈlaka}}, a colloquial [[Mexican Spanish]] name for [[skeleton]]) is a figure of a [[human skull|skull]] or [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] (usually human) commonly used for decoration during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Day of the Dead]] festival, although they are made all year round.

==Description==
Tracing their origins from [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] imagery, calacas are frequently shown with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flowers and foliage. As with other aspects of the Day of the Dead festival, calacas are generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful figures. They are often shown wearing festive clothing, dancing, and playing musical instruments to indicate a happy afterlife. This draws on the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly, and that death should be a joyous occasion. This goes back to Aztec beliefs, one of the few traditions to remain after the Spanish conquest.

Calacas used in the festival include carved skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made out of carved wood or fired clay, and sweet treats in the form of [[human skull|skull]]s or skeletons. Calacas are sometimes made of wood, stone, or even candy.

A popular phrase among Mexicans and those Latinos that personally know someone is "se lo (la) llevó la calaca" after someone has died, literally meaning "the calaca took him (her)" or "death took him (her)".

In Guatemala, "calaca" is understood as "death". The figure of a bare skeleton represents death and implies fear of death.  Thus, it is not normally utilized as a joyful image.

==Popular culture==
Calaca-like figures can be seen in the [[Tim Burton]] films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', Neil Gaiman's movie ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', the PlayStation 3 games ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) and ''[[Guacamelee!]]'' (2013), and the 1998 [[Tim Schafer]] computer game ''[[Grim Fandango]].''

Calacas are prominently featured as representations of the deceased in ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]''.

In ''[[Monster High]]'', Skelita Calaveras is a calaca and is the daughter of Los Esklitos (The Skeletons).

In ''[[El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera]]'', the villain Sartana of the Dead is a calaca and commands various calacas that are in her service.

The Calacas are featured in ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]''.

Different religions have varying stances on the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an [[entheogenic]], particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]] where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.

In the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of [[medicinal cannabis]].

==Bahá'í==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khali Akhtar Khavari|author2=Teresa McCray Harmon|title=The Relationship between the Degree of Professed Religious Belief and Use of Drugs|journal=International Journal of the Addictions|volume=17|issue=5|pages=847–857|date=1982|doi=10.3109/10826088209056331}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Bahá'í laws]]. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with "tact and wisdom".&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Udo Schaefer|title=In a blue haze, smoking and Bahá'í ethics|publisher=Zero Palm Press|edition=Translated from the original German language edition: Ethische Aspekte des Rauchens.

{{quote|Regarding [[hashish]] you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful? Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-187.html Notes #170.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the [[Five Precepts|Fifth Precept]] is frequently interpreted to mean "refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol.&lt;ref name="yinshun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yin-Shun | first = Venerable | editor = Wing H.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
Prior to assuming his position as leader of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Pope Francis]] had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: "A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bindrim|first=Kira|title=Pope Francis Speaks Out Against Legalization of Marijuana and Other Drugs|url=http://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-says-he-opposes-marijuana-legalization-255708|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catechism of the Catholic Church states that "The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P80.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date= |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Cannabis and Latter-day Saints}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Camille|title=First Presidency Asks Members to Oppose Recreational Marijuana, Assisted Suicide|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/first-presidency-asks-members-to-oppose-recreational-marijuana-assisted-suicide?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church says it has "raised no objection to SB 89" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Church Urges 'Cautious Approach' on Medical Marijuana Issue in Utah|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-urges-cautious-approach-medical-marijuana-issue-utah|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=David|title=LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/|publisher=[[KSTU]]|website=Fox13Now.com|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] has resisted legalization of cannabis in that country.&lt;ref&gt;http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/2276-fighting-georgia-s-draconian-anti-drug-law&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
The [[Arkansas Baptist State Convention]] voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Strode |url=http://www.bpnews.net/47842/marijuana-legalization-on-9-state-ballots |title=Marijuana legalization on 9 state ballots |publisher=Bpnews.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the executive director of the [[Florida Baptist Convention]], Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against [[Florida Amendment 2 (2016)|expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida]]. The 
National Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of [[cannabis in Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14372:churches-complain-about-marijuana-law&amp;catid=40:politics&amp;Itemid=90&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assemblies of God USA]], as well as other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Holiness Movement|holiness churches]], have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/topics/charctr_08_drugs.cfm | title = Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Drugs | last = | first = | date = | website = ag.org | publisher = Assemblies of God USA | access-date = April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosch |first=Torie |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/03/what_would_jesus_smoke.html |title=What do Christian groups think about marijuana? |work=Slate |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Holi]], people consume ''bhang'' which contains cannabis flowers.&lt;ref name="commission"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|year=1894|location=Simla, India|publisher=Government Central Printing House|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm}} Chapter IX: Social and Religious Customs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |title=The History of the Intoxicant Use of Marijuana |publisher=National Commission of Marijuana and Drug Abuse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813080240/http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |archivedate=2005-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one description, when the ''[[amrita]]'' (elixir of life) was produced from the [[Samudra manthan|churning of the ocean]] by the devas and the asuras, [[Shiva]] created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet ''angaja'' or "body-born"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by [[rishi|sages]] due to association with elixir and [[Shiva]].

In Hinduism, wise drinking of ''bhang'' (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with [[Shiva]] and avoid the miseries of [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] in the [[Saṃsāra|future life]]. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of ''bhang'' without rites is considered a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/Inhemp/7relhemp.htm|title=Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report - Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Halal|Islamic dietary laws}}
The [[Quran]] does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be ''[[khamr (intoxicant)|khamr]]'' (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be ''[[haraam]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammad Saed|title=Islam: Questions and Answers - Pedagogy Education and Upbringing|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|year=2003|page=123| isbn= 978-1-86179-296-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board, Colombo Plan Bureau|title=First National Workshop on Prevention and Control of Drug Abuse in Pakistan 25–30 August 1975|location=Rawalpindi|publisher=Workshop Report|year=1975|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] by the prophet Mohammed states: "If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam."&lt;ref&gt;AD 25;5&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the [[Sufi]] mystic movement.&lt;ref name="Ferrara2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

The Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to [[Jafar Sharazi]] (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Jones2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jones|title=Spliffs: A Celebration of Cannibis Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abK_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Pavilion Books|isbn=978-1-909396-32-6|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal [[Khidr]] ("Green Man").&lt;ref name="Knight2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Muhammad Knight|title=Journey to the End of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XM4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=10 December 2009|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=978-1-59376-552-1|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in [[Dearborn Heights]], Michigan (United States), declared: "Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hijazi |first=Samer |url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_12118/Marijuana-in-Islam:-Smokers-and-scholars-weigh-in.html |title=Marijuana: Arab Smokers, religious scholars weigh in |publisher=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Cannabis and Judaism}}

Though the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims "have been widely dismissed as erroneous".&lt;ref&gt;(Merlin, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sula Benet]] (1967) claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, Orthodox rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Jacobs1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian G. Jacobs|title=Judaism looks at modern issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVIRAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Aviva Press|isbn=978-0-9511560-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earleywine2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitch Earleywine|title=Pot Politics: Marijuana and the Costs of Prohibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgASDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-518802-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Rosner|title=Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7w2oAmohpEC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2001|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-701-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Orthodox rabbis [[Efraim Zalmanovich]] (2013) and [[Chaim Kanievsky]] (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elsa Vulliamy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/marijuana-is-kosher-for-passover-leading-rabbi-rules-a6995761.html |title=Marijuana is kosher for Passover, leading rabbi rules |publisher=The Independent |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari==
It is not known when [[Rastafari]] first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of [[Leonard Howell]]. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the [[Tree of Life]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. [[Peter Tosh]], among many others, has quoted {{bibleref2|Revelation|22:2}}, "... the herb is the healing of the nations."  The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called [[chalice (pipe)|chalices]], is an integral part of what Rastafari call "reasoning sessions" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to [[God]] ([[Jah]]), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.

While it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty [[Haile Selassie I]] before being smoked. According to the [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult group]] the [[Watchman Fellowship]] "The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.watchman.org/profile/rastapro.htm |title= Rastafarianism |work= Profiles |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] |first= Rick |last= Branch |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joseph Owens (Jesuit)|title=Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica|year=1974|isbn=0-435-98650-3|first=Joseph|last=Owens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], consider cannabis to be the "eucharist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/bible.html|title=Marijuana and the Bible|publisher=[[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it as an oral tradition from [[Ethiopia]] dating back to the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault : Spiritual Use #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==
[[Scientology]] opposes the use of cannabis, and made "Truth About Marijuana" the focus of their 2016 [[World Health Day]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/press-releases/activity/church-hosts-truth-about-marijuana-event.html |title=Church Hosts "Truth About Marijuana" Event |publisher=Scientologynews.org |date=2016-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{main|Cannabis and Sikhism}}
[[File:Process of making bhang in Punjab, India.jpg|thumb|Process of making bhang in a Sikh village in Punjab, India.&lt;br&gt;Photos taken by Marcus Prasad]]

In [[Sikhism]], the First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]], stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} According to the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada]]'', "A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water".&lt;ref name="amritworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritworld.com/main/?p=82#sthash.agD98t5F.dpbs|title=The ‘Sukhnidhaan’ or ‘Bhang’ (cannabis)|work=Amrit World|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage [[bhang]], particularly among the Sikh community known as [[Nihang]].&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

==Taoism==

Beginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in [[censer]]s. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' 無上秘要 ("Supreme Secret Essentials") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with "hallucinogenic smokes".&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 150]. From ancient Chinese fumigation techniques with "toxic smokes" for pests and "holy smokes" for demons, "what started as a 'smoking out' of undesirable things, changed now to a 'smoking in' of heavenly things into oneself."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji'' 元始上真眾仙記 ("Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals"), which is attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283-343), says:

:For those who begin practicing the Tao it is not necessary to go into the mountains. … Some with purifying incense and sprinkling and sweeping are also able to call down the Perfected Immortals. The followers of the Lady Wei and of Hsu are of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady [[Wei Huacun]] 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist [[Shangqing School]]. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to [[Yang Xi]] 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from [[Xian (Taoism)|immortals]], and Needham proposed Yang was "aided almost certainly by cannabis". The ''Mingyi bielu'' 名醫別錄 ("Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, "Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (''shujia'' 術家) say that if one consumes them with [[ginseng]] it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Rudgley|url=http://cannabis.net/hist/index.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the ''Wuzangjing'' 五臟經 ("Five Viscera Classic") says, "If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, and Lu Gwei-djen (1980). ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 4, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention''. Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvLroG7r2MYC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Needham connected myths about [[Magu (deity)|Magu]], "the Hemp Damsel", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of [[Shandong]]'s [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred]] [[Mount Tai]], where cannabis "was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality''].

==Other cannabis-using religious movements==

Other religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the [[Santo Daime]] church, the [[THC Ministry]], Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the [[Church of Cognizance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n848/a01.html|last=Innes|first=Stephanie|title=Pot-Deifying Duo Guilty, Confident They'll Avoid Prison|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of the Universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n1046/a05.html|last=Jackson|first=Hayes|title=Appeal Date Set For Pot Priests|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Torstar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamm.com|title=Church of the Universe|publisher=[[Church of the Universe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabischurchfl.com/ First Cannabis Church of Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org|title=InFormer Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org/9900001.jpg|title=Rev.

Modern spiritual figures like [[Ram Dass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |title=Ram Dass: Longtime Spiritual Leader, Opponent of the 'War on Drugs' |date=2004-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920210640/http://drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.

In Mexico, followers of the growing cult of [[Santa Muerte]] regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktsm.com/news/only-9-the-dark-religion-santa-muerte |title=Only on 9: The Dark Religion of the Santa Muerte &amp;#124; KTSM News Channel 9 |publisher=Ktsm.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{cite-needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the
Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L. Prins|author3=Dana Walrath|author4=Bunny McBride|title=The Essence of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59981-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EitzenZinn2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the verb ''bahar'' ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר|italics=off}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Mormonism===
{{See also|Mormonism|Mormonism and Judaism|Mormonism and Islam}}
In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people.
Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-student-study-guide/genesis-44  |title= Genesis 44&amp;nbsp;– Joseph Tests His Brothers |accessdate=|work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors{{which?|date=January 2017}} who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of [[Cain]]. [[White supremacist]] sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

==Rastafari==
{{Main article| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.

Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.

The '''Coexist image''' (often styled as "CoeXisT" or "COEXIST") is an image created by Polish, [[Warsaw]]-based graphic designer {{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}} in 2000 as an entry in an international art competition sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam for Dialogue, Understanding and Coexistence]].  The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in [[Jerusalem]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

Variations of this artwork have been used as [[bumper stickers]] and elements in [[rock concert]]s.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TDB /&gt;

==Creation – ''COEXISTENCE'' art exhibition==

{{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}}, a Polish graphic designer based in [[Warsaw]], had his original work chosen by a [[Juried (competition)|jury]] to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} x {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam]] in Jerusalem.  The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mots /&gt;

His original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized [[Crescent#Pre-Islamic and Islamic uses|Muslim Crescent]], the X replaced by an oversized [[Star of David]], and the T replaced by an oversized [[Latin Cross]].&lt;ref name=Atu2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/cant-we-all-just-coexist.html

==U2 Vertigo Tour==
[[File:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|thumb|U2 in Mexico City on the ''Vertigo'' tour – photo taken during the playing of [[Sunday Bloody Sunday]] ]]
During the international 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour]] of the Irish rock band [[U2]], the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", the group would play politically-themed songs.  During the opening portion of "[[Love and Peace or Else]]", [[Bono]] wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonobaltimore/18007038/|others=Kurman, Mike|accessdate=2015-10-20|title=Bono, 5\28\05, Boston, MA, TD Banknorth Garden

==Bumper sticker==
The image and variations of it are used as automobile [[bumper sticker]]s.&lt;ref name=TDB&gt;{{cite web|work=The Daily Beast|date=2014-12-21|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|title=COEXIST's Bonehead Bumper-Sticker Politics: America's simplistic adoption of the COEXIST bumper sticker signals a dangerous inability to understand the roots of religious conflict.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224214154/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|archivedate=2014-12-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] which began after the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.&lt;ref name = "Wrasman" /&gt;

One common version of the bumper sticker spells "COEXIST" using an Islamic crescent moon for the "C", a [[peace sign]] for the "O", a combination of the [[male symbol]] and [[female symbol]] for the "E", a [[Star of David]] for the "X", a [[pentagram]] for the dot of the "I", a [[yin-yang symbol]] for the "S", and a Christian cross for the "T".&lt;ref name = "Wrasman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrasman|first=Andy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Contradict|year=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|pages=2–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043909/https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBGoVChMIk5L4mL7MyAIVQvI-Ch2mqQEN#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781490819297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Lance|editor-last=Gharavi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0wjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=Religion, Theatre, and Performance: Acts of Faith|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136483400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the [[Bay Area]] region centered on [[San Francisco]]. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion.&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;{{cite book|last=Fish|first=M.

==Legal disputes==
In 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other.  They were also unaware that a company in [[Indiana]] already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003.  At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own.  The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image.  Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.&lt;ref name=Atu2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MotsLegal /&gt;

==Versions and other variations==
The following table shows the individual characters of the more well-known versions, either as [[Unicode]] characters, icons, or descriptions.

&lt;!-- Editor instructions:
* Only add it to this table if it spells out Coexist,
  not other variants, spoofs, etc.  Variants in
  capitalization such as COEXIST are fine.  Translations are fine.
* Only add it if you have a reliable source that the
  image is in wide use.
  This can be a newspaper article, a legal proceeding, or,
  IF the image in question has been released under a "free" license
  by its creator, a link to a copy of the image uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons
  Put the source or a small version of the Commons image in the "notes" section.
* Only add it if it's in wide use – be aware that some versions may be "novelty"
  items created for a specific event and adding them here would likely clutter up
  the list or worse, invite the creators to "spam" this page for promotional purposes.
* A partial table of unicode symbols can be found at
  http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/So/list.htm
  and many other places on the Internet
* PREVIEW YOUR CHANGES BEFORE SAVING YOUR EDIT – it's really easy
  to mess up a table if you are not careful.
* Double-check that any "Note" links work in both directions.

==Parodies==

The popularity of the bumper stickers has spawned several anti-Muslim responses, including one with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.&lt;ref name = "Gharavi" /&gt;

There are several anti-religious parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction' and 'Contradict'.

Other parodies include a Communist [[hammer and sickle]] for the "E" and a [[swastika]] for the "X", indicating the dangers inherent in all ideologies.&lt;ref name=Bowen&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Jack|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22#v=onepage&amp;q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&amp;f=false|title=If You Can Read This: The Philosophy of Bumper Stickers|publisher=Random House|year=2010|page=193|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023044358/https://books.google.com/books?id=9kj71CJ2-cwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgKahUKEwiA2vu7uc3IAhUENz4KHY60Ano|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781588369505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1952">'''Compensationism''' is one of several theological doctrines, opposed to [[Probabilism]].

==Doctrine==
Compensationism maintains that a doubtful law is not devoid of all binding force, and that there must be a compensating reason, proportionate to the probability and gravity of the law, to justify the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. This teaching is based on an analogy with an act which has two effects, one good and the other bad. It is not lawful to perform such an act unless there is a justifying cause proportionate to the evil. In the case of a doubtful law the bad effect is the danger of material sin, and the good effect is the benefit, which arises from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. Hence in this as in the former case, a compensating cause, proportionate to the probable evil, is required to justify the performance of the action.

Probabilists reply that this moral system leads to [[Tutiorism]], because it implies that if no compensating benefit exists, it is not lawful to perform an action so long as it certainly is not forbidden. Again, Probabilists say that the preservation of liberty is of itself a sufficient compensating reason when there is question of a law which is not certain. Finally, Probabilists are prepared to admit that, as a point of expediency though not of obligation, it is advisable to look for a compensating cause over and above the preservation of liberty when a confessor is directing penitents in the use of probable opinions. If no such compensating reason exists, the penitent can be advised, though not under pain of sin, to abstain from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of [[Zoroastrianism]]''' has taken place over many centuries not only from the adherents of other religions but also among Zoroastrians themselves seeking to reform the faith.

==Zoroaster==
In the early 19th century, a Christian missionary based in [[British India]], [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]], claimed that [[Zoroaster]] never had a genuine divine commission (or ever claimed such a role),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; never performed miracles, or uttered prophecies and that the story of his life is "a mere tissue of comparatively modern fables and fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Vevaina|editor2-first=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|date=23 Mar 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118785508|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that all the available Zoroastrian sources regarding Zoroaster only provide conflicting images about him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially between earlier and later sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The [[Dasatir-i-Asmani]], while being accepted by Zoroastrian communities in Iran and India as genuine, especially by the [[Kadmi]], it is generally believed to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson argued that the [[Avesta]] could not be divinely inspired because much of its text was irrevocably lost or unintelligible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Haug]], who greatly helped the Parsis of India to defend their religion against the attacks of such Christian missionaries as Wilson, considered the [[Gathas]] to be the only texts and only authoritative scriptures that could be attributed to Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polytheism==
John Wilson attacked the Zoroastrian reverence of the [[Amesha Spenta]] and [[Yazata]]s as a form of [[polytheism]], although the Parsis at the time immediately refuted this allegation and insisted that he had in fact addressed the ''Bundahishn'', a text whose relevance to their practice was remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=479–80|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also commonly claim that Zoroastrians are worshipers of other deities and elements of nature, such as [[Fire worship|of fire]]—with one prayer, the Litany to the fire (Atesh Niyaesh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. Hinnells|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|date=28 Apr 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198267591|page=706|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "I invite, I perform (the worship) of you, the Fire, O son of Ahura Mazdā together with all fires"—and [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=50, 298–99|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have charged Zoroastrians with being followers of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], who only claimed to be followers of [[monotheism]] in modern times to confront the powerful influence of Christian and Western thought which "hailed monotheism as the highest category of theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla|authorlink1=Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla|title=Zoroastrian Theology: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day|date=1914|page=337|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Zoroastrian_Theology_from_the_Earliest_Times_to_the_Present_Day_1000035071/369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics insist that the monotheistic reformist view is seen to contradict the conservative (or traditional) view of a dualistic worldview most evident in the relationship between [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that Zoroastrians follow a belief system influenced by [[Henotheism#Zoroastrianism|henotheism]]. Other Western scholars such as [[Martin Haug]], however, have dismissed the concept of theological dualism as a corruption of Zoroaster's original teachings, gradually added by later adherents of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics add that the fact that such differing views have proliferated are a sign of the enigmatic nature of the Zoroastrian beliefs regarding the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-Zoroastrian divisions==
Zoroastrian reformers, such as [[Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla]], have argued that literary precedence should be given to the Gathas, as a source of authority and textual authenticity. They have also deplored and criticized many Zoroastrian rituals (e.g. excessive ceremonialism and focus on purity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=43|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "[[bull]]'s urine for ritual cleansing, the attendance of a dog to gaze at the corpse during funerary rites, the exposure of corpses [[Tower of Silence|on towers]] [for consumption by vultures and ravens]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=471|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theological and cosmological doctrines as not befitting of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''orthodox'' versus ''reformist'' controversy rages even on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=51|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions and tensions also exist between [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Iranian]] and [[Zoroastrianism in India|Indian Zoroastrians]] and over such issues as the authority of a [[Priestly caste|hereditary priesthood]] in the transmission and interpretation of the faith, ethnicity and the nature of [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, differences also existed between the Zoroastrian branches of [[Zurvanism]], [[Mazdakism]] and [[Mazdaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Leaman|editor1-first=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|date=19 Oct 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134691159|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who is a Zoroastrian (Zarathushti)?==
Much like the question of [[who is a Jew?]], Zoroastrian identity, especially whether it is adopted through birth or belief (or both), "remains a cause for tension" within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=210–11, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ariane Sherine|title=Zoroastrianism needs to adapt its archaic laws – or die|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/dec/08/zorastrianism-adapt-archaic-laws-die-parsi|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers have criticised the orthodox refusal to accept religious converts as one reason for the communities' declining population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=LAURIE GOODSTEIN|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predestination==
Zoroastrians have been criticized by Muslim authors for their rejection of [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Ibn Taymiyyah]]|editor1-last=Memon|editor1-first=Muhammad Umar|editor1-link=Muhammad Umar Memon|title=Ibn Taimiya's Struggle Against Popular Religion: With an Annotated Translation of His Kitab iqtida as-sirat al-mustaqim mukhalafat ashab al-jahim|date=1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783111662381|page=117|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tamim Ansary|title=Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586488130|page=9|edition=illustrated, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a famous [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad]] in which he negatively associates the [[Qadariyah]] Islamic sect with the [[Magi]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Martin|author2=Mark R. Woodward|author3=Dwi S.

==Patriarchy==
Zoroastrianism has been criticized for the perception that it promotes a [[patriarchal system]], expressed through such avenues as an all-male priesthood and its historical allowance of [[polygamy]]—practiced by Zoroaster himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ghada Hashem Talhami|title=Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810868588|pages=186, 372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dale T.

'''David Tynan O'Mahony''' (6 July 1936{{spaced ndash}}10 March 2005), better known as '''Dave Allen''', was an Irish [[observational comedy|observational comedian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Double|first1=Oliver|title=Stand-Up! on being a comedian|date=1997|contribution=Dave Allen|publisher=Methuen Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0413703200|page=140|quote=This was quite an innovation, because up to this point there had been no tradition of observational comedy in British stand-up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[satire|satirist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaither|first1=Carl C. &amp; Alma E.|title=Gaither's Dictionary of Scientific Quotations|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-1114-7|page=906|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially becoming known in Australia during 1963–64, Allen made regular television appearances in the United Kingdom from the later 1960s and until the mid-1980s. The [[BBC]] aired his ''Dave Allen Show'' 1972–1986,&lt;ref&gt;BBC's released DVD (this copy for Sweden and Finland), back side of its cover states (translated from Swedish "The best sketches 1971–1986 with Dave Allen" (a combination of him sitting in his famous chair, drinking, smoking and telling jokes - and his sketches)&lt;/ref&gt; which was also exported to several other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;The mentioned DVD clearly supports at least Sweden and Finland&lt;/ref&gt; His career had a major resurgence during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the height of his career he was Britain's most controversial comedian, regularly provoking indignation at his frequent highlighting of political hypocrisy and disregard for religious authority. His television shows were also broadcast in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.

David Tynan O'Mahony was born in [[Firhouse]], [[Dublin]], Ireland, the youngest of three sons&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; of Gerard "Cully" Tynan O'Mahony, managing editor of ''[[The Irish Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | title=Dave Allen: Irreverent comedian whose reflective monologues provoked outrage and delight | first=Stephen | last=Dixon | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=12 March 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2014 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an English mother, Jean Archer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;ti=0&amp;r=an&amp;db=ONSmarriage1984&amp;F2=O%27Mahony&amp;F4=1a&amp;F5=1402&amp;F0=Archer&amp;rank=0&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;pcat=BMD_MARRIAGE&amp;fh=0&amp;h=50606886&amp;recoff= |title=Ancestry.com |publisher=Search.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers were John and Peter.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Robin Brown (Director) |date=19 April 2013 |title=Dave Allen: God's Own Comedian |medium=Television documentary |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s94tc |accessdate =12 November 2014 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Two]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mahony left school aged 16, after attending the secondary school at [[Newbridge College]], [[Terenure College]] and the [[Catholic University School]], and followed his father into [[journalism]]. He joined the ''Drogheda Argus'' as a [[copy boy]], but at the age of 19 went to [[London]].

==Career==
He drifted through a series of jobs, before becoming a [[Redcoats (Butlins)|Butlins Redcoat]] at [[Skegness]] in a troupe that also included the British jazz trumpeter and writer [[John Chilton]].  At the end of each summer season he did stand-ups at [[Striptease|strip]] clubs and for the next four years appeared in night clubs, theatres and working men's clubs. When entertainment work was slow he sold toys in a [[Sheffield]] store and also worked as a door-to-door draught-excluder salesman.  He changed his stage surname to "Allen" on the prompting of his agent, who believed that few people in Britain could pronounce "O'Mahony" correctly. Allen himself hoped that a surname beginning with "A" would put him at the top of any agent's list.

Allen lost the top of his left forefinger above the middle knuckle after catching it in a machine cog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Caden |date=20 February 2005 |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fingered-at-last-the-truth-behind-the-comedians-missing-digit-26205189.html |title=Fingered at last: the truth behind the comedian's missing digit |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he enjoyed inventing stories to explain the loss, which became a minor part of his act. One version was that his brother John had surprised him by snapping his jaw shut when they were children, resulting in him biting it off. A further explanation he gave on his programme, ''Dave Allen at Large'', was that he often stuck his finger in his whiskey glass, and it had been eaten away by strong drink. He also said it was worn away from repeatedly brushing the dust from his suit. One of his stand-up jokes was that, when he was a boy, he and his friends would go see a cowboy movie at the local cinema, then come out all ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Staring down at his truncated finger, he would mutter, "I had a sawn-off shotgun." On his show he told a long, elaborate ghost story, ending with "something evil" attacking Allen in a dark and haunted house. Allen grabbed and bit the attacker, the studio lights came back up, and it was his own left hand.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Story related in "Dave Allen at Peace", Telemovie 9partially fictionalised), BBC, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen's first television appearance was on the BBC talent show ''New Faces'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ "Great Irish Comedians"], BBC Comedy  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321163125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ |date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted pop music shows in the early 1960s, including tours by [[Adam Faith]] and [[Helen Shapiro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/bradford_timeline/5548903853/in/set-72157626323725628/ |title=Helen Shapiro tour programme, 1961 |author=Bradford Timeline |work=Flickr |year=2011 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 1963 was the compère of a [[The Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour|tour of Britain]], headlined by Shapiro, that also included [[The Beatles]], then starting to become well known. In 1962 he had toured [[South Africa]] with American vaudeville star [[Sophie Tucker]], whom he described as "one of the most charming and delightful performers with whom I have ever worked". Tucker was impressed with him and suggested that he try his luck in Australia. Moving there, he worked with [[Digby Wolfe]] on Australian television, becoming Wolfe's resident comedian.

While on tour in Australia in 1963, he quickly proved successful and accepted an offer to headline a television talk show with [[Nine Network|Channel 9]], ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', which was also successful. However, only six months after his television début he was banned from the Australian airwaves when, during a live broadcast, he told his show's producer—who had been pressing him to go to a commercial break—to "go away and masturbate", so that he could continue an entertaining interview with [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The ban was dropped quietly as Allen's popularity continued unabated.

Allen returned to the United Kingdom in 1964 and made a number of appearances on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], including ''The Blackpool Show'' and ''[[Val Parnell]]'s [[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'', and on the BBC on ''[[Val Doonican|The Val Doonican Show]]''. In 1967 he hosted his own comedy/chat series, ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', made by [[Associated Television|ATV]], which earned him the [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety Club's]] ITV Personality of the Year Award.

He signed with the BBC in 1968 and appeared on ''The Dave Allen Show'', a variety/comedy sketch series. This was followed from 1971-79 by ''Dave Allen at Large''.  The theme tune for ''The Dave Allen Show'' and ''Dave Allen at Large'', written by [[Alan Hawkshaw]], was "Blarney's Stoned" (originally recorded for [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] in 1969 under the title "Studio 69").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm 'Off the telly' website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228123122/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shows introduced his solo joke-telling-while-sitting-on-a-stool-and-drinking routine. This stand-up routine by Allen led to sketches that continued the themes touched on in the preceding monologues. Meanwhile, he began to appear in theatre. In 1972 he acted as a doctor in the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]]'s production of [[Edna O'Brien]]'s play ''A Pagan Place''. With family friend [[Maggie Smith]]&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; in the lead, he appeared in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in a run during 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 March 2005 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974. Allen played the roles of [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|Mr Darling]] and [[Captain Hook]] in the production at the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce K. |last=Hanson |title=Peter Pan on Stage and Screen: 1904–2010 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen made ''The Dave Allen Show in Australia'' (1975–1977) for his old employers, Channel 9.

Allen was also a social commentator, appearing in several television documentaries for ITV, beginning with ''Dave Allen in the Melting Pot'' (1969), looking at life in [[New York City]] and dealing with issues such as racism and drugs. Later programmes included ''Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric'' (1974) and ''Eccentrics at Play'' (1974), in which he looked at [[Eccentricity (behavior)|colourful characters]] with idiosyncratic passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayward|first=Anthony |title=Dave Allen (obituary)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dave-allen-5838.html |accessdate=6 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 March 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Both the BBC and Dave Allen received death threats from the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and the [[Provisional IRA]]" {{cn|date=November 2018}}
 
Allen's satirizing of religious ritual, especially Catholic, throughout each episode of ''Dave Allen at Large'' caused minor controversy, which - coupled with sometimes comparatively frank material - earned the show a risqué reputation. In 1977 the Irish state broadcaster [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]] placed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on Allen. Routines included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his cardinals doing a striptease to music ("[[The Stripper]]") on the steps of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], aggressive priests beating their parishioners and other priests, priests who spoke like [[Dalek]]s through electronic confessionals, and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a [[Chico Marx]] style accent as he ordered Allen to "getta your bum outta Roma!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Dave Allen |year=2005 |editor-first=Graham |editor-last=McCann |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he played a troubled property man suffering a mid-life crisis in [[Alan Bennett]]'s television play ''One Fine Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137997/ |title=One Fine Day (TV Movie 1979) |work=IMDb |year=2014  |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New seasons of the comedy series, now titled ''Dave Allen'', were broadcast from 1981 until 1990.

===Later career===
His final series for the BBC in 1990 caused controversy with a joke:&lt;ref name="Newley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newley|first=Patrick|date=March 2005|title=Obituaries: Dave Allen|journal=The Stage|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2005/03/dave-allen/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/11/broadcasting.uknews|title=Dave Allen dies aged 68 |last=Plunkett|first=John|date=11 March 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/jan/16/offensive-language|title=Offensive Language|date=16 January 1990|work=Hansard HC Deb|pages=vol 165 c173W|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We spend our lives on the run. We get up by the clock, eat and sleep by the clock, go to work by the clock, get up again, go to work – and then we retire. And what do they fucking give us? A clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNz_9FlxNw|title=Video of Show|date=11 January 1990|work="offensive language"|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This prompted MP [[Robert Hayward]] to ask a [[question time|parliamentary question]] about "offensive language" in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Newley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt; In 1993 Allen returned to ITV, where he starred in the ''Dave Allen Show'', which was his final regular television series.

By the late 1990s Allen was living quietly in semi-retirement at home in [[Holland Park]], west London. A keen amateur artist, he continued to exhibit his paintings.&lt;ref name = "telegraph"/&gt; He had given up cigarettes in the 1980s, having smoked regularly during earlier television appearances. A comedy skit in 1994 talked not only about quitting smoking but hating the smell of smoke. The 90s saw him make occasional chat show appearances and discuss his career in the six-part ''The Unique Dave Allen'' (BBC, 1998), in between clips from his past BBC series.

As he grew older, he brought a rueful awareness of aging to his material, with reflections on the antics of teenagers and the sagging skin and sprouting facial hair of age. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 1996.

==Material==
===Act===
Allen's act was typified by a relaxed, rueful and intimate style. He sat on a high bar stool facing his audience, smoking and occasionally sipping from a glass of what he always allowed people to assume was whiskey but in fact was merely ginger ale with ice. He was a sober-minded man, and although he sometimes appeared crotchety and irritable on stage he always gave off an air of charm and serene melancholy, both in his act and in real life. Each day he pored over newspapers, scribbling notes and ideas for his routines. Along with his seated stand-up routines his television shows were interspersed with filmed sketch comedy.

===Religion===
He was a religious sceptic&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen obituary |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=29 May 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to Allen, "what you might call a practising [[Atheism|atheist]]", and often joked, "I'm an atheist, thank God") as a result of his deeply held objections to the rigidity of his strict Catholic schooling. Consequently religion became an important subject for his humour, especially the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Church of England]], generally mocking church customs and rituals rather than beliefs. In 1998 he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The hierarchy of everything in my life has always bothered me. I'm bothered by power. People, whoever they might be, whether it's the government, or the policeman in the uniform, or the man on the door—they still irk me a bit. From school, from the first nun that belted me—people used to think of the nice sweet little ladies—they used to knock the fuck out of you, in the most cruel way that they could. They'd find bits of your body that were vulnerable to intense pain—grabbing you by the ear, or by the nose, and lift you, and say 'Don't cry!' It's very hard not to cry. I mean, not from emotion, but pain. The priests were the same. And I sit and watch politicians with great cynicism, total cynicism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of his act Allen always raised his glass and quietly toasted his audience with the words "Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10026098/Dave-Allen-Gods-Own-Comedian-BBC2-review.html|title=Dave Allen – God's Own Comedian, BBC2, review|first=Martin|last=Chilton|date=28 December 2014|newspaper=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on others==
Highly regarded in Britain, Allen's comic technique and style had a lasting influence on many young British comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |title=Mark Thomas: method and madness of a TV comic |first=Amy |last=Otchet |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |year=May 1999 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126160232/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; His targets were often figures of authority, his style was observational rather than gag-driven, and his language frequently ripe;  as such he was a progenitor for the "alternative" comedians of the 1980s. In his native Ireland, he always remained somewhat controversial. His mocking of the Catholic Church made him unpopular amongst some Irish Catholics, while his mocking of the [[Ulster]] Protestant leader [[Ian Paisley, Baron Bannside|Ian Paisley]] made him unpopular amongst many [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].  

In a 2017 interview with [[Howard Stern]], [[Adam Sandler]] attributed Dave Allen as one of his first comedic influences when he saw his act at the Nevele hotel at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-O3VjdmbzA|title=Howard Stern Show April 12 2017|first=|last=|date=13 April 2017|publisher=Howard Stern|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1964 Allen married actress Judith Stott, whom he had met in Australia. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983. Their son, Edward James Tynan O'Mahony (professionally Ed Allen), is also a comedian.

Allen's hobbies included painting, which he became increasingly enthusiastic about in his later years. His first exhibition, ''Private Views'', was held in [[Edinburgh]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZvGmocvz_SYJ:https://www.scotsman.com/news/celebrity/final-bow-for-comic-who-put-the-alternative-into-comedy-1-739337+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=jp=|title=Final Bow for Comic who put the Alternative into Comedy |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=  12 March 2005|accessdate=8 January 2017 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died peacefully in his sleep as a result of [[Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome]] at his home in [[Kensington]], London, on 10 March 2005 at the age of 68. He was survived by Karin Tynan O'Mahony (née Stark), his wife of 18 months who had been his partner since 1986,&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; and his three children from his first marriage: his children Edward and Jane, and stepson Jonathan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-428602/Dave-Allen-leaves-3m--adopted-daughter.html |title=Dave Allen leaves £3m in his will... but nothing to his adopted daughter |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |date= 13 January 2007|accessdate=6 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a son of his first wife. Three weeks after Allen's death Karin gave birth to their son, Cullen.

A dramatisation of Allen's life and career, entitled ''Dave Allen At Peace'', was shown on [[RTÉ One]] and [[BBC Two]] in 2018, with [[Aidan Gillen]] portraying the comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/14/daveallen |title=BBC programme information, |accessdate=25 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Media Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deconsecration''' is the act of removing a religious blessing from something that had been previously [[consecration|consecrated]] by a minister or priest of that religion. The practice is usually performed on churches to be rendered to non-religious ([[secular]]) use or demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1876/11/03/archives/deconsecration-of-a-london-church.html |title=Deconsecration of a London Church |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 1876 |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]'s [[coregency]] marked the end of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the reign of [[James II of England]]. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious [[paradigm]] of 17th-century England, which was [[Roman Catholic]] when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the "vile pop'ry" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of [[Protestant]] liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacCubbin |first1=Robert P. |last2=Hamilton-Phillips |first2=Martha |last3=College of William and Mary|last4=Grolier Club|last5=Folger Shakespeare Library|date=1990 |title=The Age of William III &amp; Mary II: Power, Politics and Patronage, 1688-1702 : A Reference Encyclopedia and Exhibition Catalogue |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |isbn=0962208108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant copies of the ballad are available at [[Magdelene College]] in the [[Pepys Library]].

The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is "seated on the throne": "The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the "[[Whore of Babylon|Babylonian Dame]]" mentioned in these lines, was [[English Reformation|once again no longer the official religion of England]]. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: "May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing."

==Form==
The ballad is broken up into eight [[:wikt:octet|octets]] with varying [[rhyme scheme]]s. For instance, the first stanza has an ''AA BB CCC B'' rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an ''AAA B CCC B'' rhyme scheme.

The '''expulsion of the Jews from Spain''' was ordered in 1492 by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ruling Castile and Aragon through the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]] with the purpose, according to the decree, of preventing them from influencing "[[New Christian]]s", Jews and their descendants who had under duress converted to Christianity. The decision to expel the Jews—or to prohibit the practice of [[Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=11|ps=«Normalmente los historiadores nos referimos al decreto de 31 de marzo de 1492, firmado por los Reyes Católicos, como si se tratara de la expulsión de los judíos. Fue oficialmente derogado por el gobierno español en 1970, cuando ya hacía más de un siglo que había israelitas residiendo en España, donde las sinagogas venían funcionando al amparo de leyes de libertad religiosa que eran objeto de críticas. Por eso resulta más correcto referirse a dicho documento como una ''prohibición'' de la práctica de la religión hebrea. […] En 1492 se había puesto a los hebreos en una disyuntiva: o se bautizaban integrándose en la comunidad del reino o debían abandonar el territorio».}}&lt;/ref&gt;—followed the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Crown of Castile|Crowns of Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] to weed out the [[converso]]s who continued practising their old faith. Historian [[Julio Valdeón Baruque|Julio Valdeón]] wrote, "undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the [[history of Spain]]". French hispanist [[Joseph Pérez]] highlighted the similarities that exist between this expulsion and the persecution of the [[Jews]] in Hispania visigoda almost a thousand years earlier.

In 2015 the [[Spanish Parliament]] passed a [[Sephardi Jews#Spanish citizenship by Spanish Sephardic descent|law recognizing as Spanish]] those presumed to be descendants of the Jews expelled in 1492, thereby annulling the consequences of that expulsion.

== Background ==

=== Jews in the peninsular medieval Christian states ===
{{main|Anti-Judaism}}
[[File:Toledo_-_Sinagoga_El_Transito_int_02.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Synagogue of El Transito]] of Toledo]]

Until the fourteenth century the Jews who lived under the Muslim caliphates of [[Al-Ándalus|Al-Andalus]] were tolerated.

On January 2, 1492, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]]. The last Muslim king, [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]], withdrew to the [[Alpujarras]] after almost 800 years of Muslim rule were ended by the [[Reconquista]].

A letter sent by the Catholic Monarchs to the Council of Bilbao in 1490 stated that under canon law and according to the laws of the kingdoms, the Jews are tolerated and allowed to live in the kingdoms as subjects and vassals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Pérez]] said "one must discard the commonly accepted idea of a Spain where members of the three religions of the Book—[[Christian]]s, [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Jews]]—would have lived together peacefully during the first two centuries of Al-Andalus, and later in the Christian Reconquest of Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. [[Toleration|Tolerance]] implies not discriminating against minorities and respecting their difference, and between the eighth and fifteenth centuries we find nothing on the peninsula like tolerance." He states that communities of Christians, Jews and Muslims had never lived In the Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Kamen]], Jews and Muslims were treated "with contempt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Jews were treated with disdain. Three communities "lived separate stocks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp=11; 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Christian anti-Judaism in the medieval West was intensified, which is reflected in the harsh anti-Jewish measures agreed in the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] celebrated in 1215 at the behest of the [[Pope Innocent III]]. The peninsular Christian kingdoms were by no means foreign to the growth of increasingly belligerent anti-Judaism—in the Castilian code of [[Siete Partidas]] it was said that the Jews lived among Christians "so that their presence would remind that they descended from those who crucified Our Lord Jesus Christ"—but the kings continued to "protect" the Jews for the important role they played in their kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp=10-11|ps=«Los judíos, perseguidos, hallaron refugio en los reinos cristianos del norte, donde fueron bien acogidos por los príncipes porque procedían de un país –[[Al-Ándalus]]- cuya civilización era por aquel entonces muy superior a la de la España cristiana, porque hablaban árabe, porque conocían la organización política, económica y social de los territorios musulmanes y porque dominaban las técnicas comerciales más avanzadas».}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourteenth century the period of "tolerance" towards the Jews was over, passing into a phase of increasing conflicts. According to Joseph Perez, "the changing times are not the mentalities, the circumstances. The good times of Spain of the three religions had coincided with a phase of territorial, demographic and economic expansion, Jews and Christians did not compete in the labor market: both one and the other contributed to the general prosperity and shared their benefits. The militant of the Church and the [[Mendicant orders|friars]] hardly found an echo. Of the fourteenth century, the wars and natural catastrophes that precede and follow the [[Black Plague]] create a new situation. ... [People] believe themselves to be the victim of a curse, punished for sins they would have committed. It invites the faithful to repent, to change their behavior and to return to God. This is when the presence of the "deicidal people" among Christians is considered scandalous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Jewish massacres of 1391 and its consequences ===
The first wave of violence against the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula occurred in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] as a consequence of the arrival in 1321 of the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|crusade of the shepherds]] from the other side of the Pyrenees. The [[Jews|Jewry]] of [[Pamplona]] and [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] are massacred. Two decades later the impact of the [[Black Death]] of 1348 provokes assaults on the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|juderías]] of several places, especially those of Barcelona and other places in the Principality of Catalonia. In the Crown of Castile anti-Jewish violence is closely related to the Civil War of the reign of Pedro I in which the side that supported Enrique de Trastámara used anti-Judaism as a propaganda weapon, and the pretender accused his stepbrother, King Peter, of favoring the Jews. Thus the first slaughter of Jews, in Toledo in 1355, was carried out by the supporters of Enrique de Trastámara when they entered the city. The same happened eleven years later when they occupied [[Briviesca]]. In Burgos, Jews who could not pay the large tribute imposed on them in 1366 were reduced to slavery and sold. In Valladolid the Jewry was assaulted in 1367 to the shout of "Long live King Henry!". There were no deaths, but the synagogues were burned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 13-15|quote=The civil war has changed the situation of the Jews in the crown of Castile. For the first time, [[anti-Semitism]] has been exploited politically; for the first time, has taken violent forms and has led to massacres and looting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matanza de judíos en Barcelona - año 1391.jpg|thumb|270px|''Slaughter of Jews in Barcelona in 1391'' ([[Josep Segrelles]], c. 1910).]]
But the great catastrophe for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula took place in 1391 when massacres took place in the juderías of the Crowns of Castile and of Aragon. The assaults, the fires, the looting and the massacres begin in June in Seville, where [[Ferrand Martinez]], archdeacon of Écija, taking advantage of the power vacuum created by the death of the archbishop of Seville, hardened his preaching against the Jews that had begun in 1378, and ordered the overthrow of the synagogues and requisitioning of prayer books. In January of 1391, a first attempt of assault on the Jewish quarter was avoided by the municipal authorities, but in June hundreds of Jews were murdered, their houses ransacked, and the synagogues converted into churches. Some Jews managed to escape; others, terrified, asked to be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Seville anti-Jewish violence extended throughout Andalusia, and then extended to Castile. In August it reached the Crown of Aragon. Murders, looting and fires took place everywhere. Many of the Jews who survived fled, many to the kingdoms of Navarre and of Portugal, France, and North Africa. Others accepted baptism to avoid death. The number of victims is difficult to know. About 400 Jews were murdered in Barcelona; in Valencia 250; In Lérida 68 ... &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez |2012|pp=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the massacres of 1391, anti-Jewish measures were intensified: in 1411 Castile ordered that Jews wear a red badge sewn to their clothing. In the Crown of Aragon the possession of the [[Talmud]] was declared unlawful, and the number of synagogues per aljama is limited to one. In addition, the mendicant orders, with the support of the monarchs, intensified their campaign of proselytism, in which Valencian [[Vincent Ferrer]] played a prominent part, to convert Jews to Christianity. It was also decreed that Jews were obliged to attend three sermons every year. As a result of the massacres of 1391 and the measures that followed, by 1415 more than half of the Jews of Castile and Aragon had renounced the Mosaic law and had been baptized, including many [[rabbi]]s and important members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in the fifteenth century ===
[[File:Spanishhaggadah.jpg|thumb|Miniature of a Spanish [[haggadah]] of the fourteenth century]]

After the massacres of 1391 and the preaching that followed them, by 1415 scarcely a hundred thousand Jews continued to practice their religion in the crowns of Castile and Aragon. Joseph Perez said, "Spanish Judaism will never recover from this catastrophe." The Jewish community "came out of the crisis not only physically diminished but morally and intellectually shattered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Crown of Aragon, Judaism in important places such as Barcelona, Valencia and Palma virtually disappeared—in 1424 the Barcelona Jewry was abolished because it was considered unnecessary—&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only the Zaragoza one remained. In Castile aljamas once flourishing such as those of Seville, Toledo or Burgos lost much of their members; in 1492, the year of the expulsion, in the Crown of Aragon only a quarter of the former number of Jews remained. The famous Jewish community of [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]], for example, was left with only 24 families. In the Crown of Castile not 80,000 were left. In Seville before the revolts of 1391 there were about 500 Jewish families. According to Joseph Perez, at the time of the expulsion there were fewer than 150,000 Jews, distributed in 35 aljamas of the Crown of Aragon and 216 in the Crown of Castile. In both Crowns it was observed that the Jews had left the great cities and lived in the small and the rural areas, less exposed "to the excesses of the Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp. 138; 164-165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish celebrating [[Havdalah|havdalá]], detail of miniature of the century XIV.]]

After the critical period of 1391-1415, the pressure on Jews recovering their synagogues and books confiscated decreased, and they became able to avoid certain obligations such as carrying the red ribbon or attending friars' sermons. They could also reconstruct the internal organization of the aljamas and their religious activities, thanks to the agreements reached by the procurators of the aljamas gathered in Valladolid in 1432 and sanctioned by the king, which means that "the Crown of Castile accepts again officially that a minority of its subjects has another religion than the Christian one and recognizes the right of this minority to exist legally, with a legal status." "In this way the Jewish community is rebuilt with the approval of the crown." Abraham Beneviste, who presided over the meeting of Valladolid, was appointed court rabbi with authority over all the Jews of the kingdom, and at the same time as delegate of the king over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=139-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, in the last quarter of the 15th century, many Jews lived in rural villages and engaged in agricultural activities. Crafts and trade were not monopolized—international trade had passed into the hands of converts. While Jews continued to trade as [[money-lender]]s, the number of Christian lenders had increased a lot. Jews also continued to collect royal, ecclesiastical and seigniorial rents, but their importance had also diminished—in Castile they were only in charge of a quarter of the revenues. However, in the court of Castile—but not Aragon—Jews held important administrative and financial positions. [[Abraham Senior]] was from 1488 treasurer-major of the Holy Brotherhood, a key organism in the financing of the [[Granada War|war of Grenada]], and also chief rabbi of Castile. Yucé Abravanel was "A greater collector of the service and mountaineering of the herds, one of the more healthy income and greater yield of the Crown of Castile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=165-167}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Joseph Perez, the role of the Jews in the court must not be exaggerated. "The truth was that the state could do without the Jews, both in the bureaucratic apparatus and in the management of the estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isabel la reina catolica.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]]]]

We must therefore reject the claim that the Hebrew community at the end of the fifteenth century was immensely rich and influential. "In fact, the Spanish Jews at the time of their expulsion did not form a homogeneous social group. There were among them classes as in Christian society, a small minority of very rich and well-placed men, together with a mass of small people: Farmers, artisans, shopkeepers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; What united them was that they practiced the same faith, different from the one recognized, which made them a separate community within the monarchy and which was "property" of the crown which thereby protected them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=168-169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 7 July, 1477, addressed to the authorities of [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], where incidents had occurred against the Jews, Queen Isabella I of Castile, after putting the aljama under her protection and prohibiting all type of oppression or humiliation against its members, states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All the Jews of my kingdoms are mine and are under my protection, and it is for me to defend and protect them and to keep them in justice.}}

Thus, the Jews "formed not a State in the State, but rather a micro-society next to the majority Christian society, with an authority [the rabbi greater] that the crown delegated to him over its members." The aljamas were organized internally with a wide margin of autonomy. They designated by lottery the council of elders that governed the life of the community; collecting their own taxes for the maintenance of worship, synagogues, and rabbinical teaching; lived under the norms of Jewish law, and had their own courts that understood all cases in civil matters - from the Cortes de Madrigal of 1476 criminal cases had passed to the royal courts. But Jews did not enjoy the fullness of civil rights: they had a specific tax system far more burdensome than that of Christians and were excluded from positions that could confer authority on Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=169-170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in which the Jews lived, according to Joseph Perez, posed two problems: "as subjects and vassals of the king, the Jews had no guarantee for the future - the monarch could at any time close the autonomy of the aljamas or require new Most important taxes-"; and, above all, "in these late years of the Middle Ages, when a state of modern character is being developed, there could be no question of a problem of immense importance: was the existence of separate and autonomous communities compatible with the demands of A modern state? This was the real question."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp=170-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "converso problem" and the creation of the Inquisition ===
{{main|Origins of the Spanish Inquisition}}
[[File:Tajador judeo-español s.XIV.jpg|thumb|Judeo-Spanish dish of century XIV]]

In the fifteenth century, the main problem stopped being the Jews to become the conversos, whose number according to Joseph Perez would probably be close to two hundred thousand people. Christian convert was applied to the Jews who had been [[Baptism|baptized]] and their descendants. As many of them had done it by force they were always looked upon with distrust by those who will call themselves [[Old Christian|Old Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the fifteenth century the positions abandoned by the Jews were mostly occupied by the converts, who concentrated there where the Jewish communities had flourished before 1391. They dealt with the activities formerly performed by the Jews - trade, the handicraft - and now with the added advantage that as Christians they can access trades and professions that were previously forbidden to the Jews. Some even enter the clergy becoming [[Biblical canon|canon]] so [[prior]] is&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social rise of the converts was viewed with suspicion by the "old" Christians, a resentment that was accentuated by the conscience on the part of those who had a differentiated identity, proud of being Christians and having Jewish ancestry, which was the lineage of Christ. Thus popular revolts broke out against the converts between 1449 and 1474, when in Castile lived a period of economic difficulties and political crisis (especially during the civil war of the reign of Henry IV). The first and most important of these revolts was the one that took place in 1449 in Toledo, during which a "Judgment-Statute" was approved that prohibited the access to the municipal positions of "no confesso of the lineage of the Jews" - an antecedent of the following blood-cleaning statutes of the following century. The origin of the revolts was economic in Andalusia especially there was a situation of hunger, aggravated by an epidemic of plague - and in principle "not directed especially against the converts." It is the parties and the demagogues that take advantage of the exasperation of the people and direct it against the converts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 20-21| ps = "The rich are hated because they are safe from hunger and disease; traders are accused of storing wheat to cause prices to rise; the houses of one and the other are looted."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Católicos.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Cuadro ''[[La Virgen de los Reyes Católicos|Virgen de los Reyes Católicos]]'' in which appears kneeling behind the king Ferdinand the Catholic, the inquisitor general [[Tomás de Torquemada]] and kneeling behind the queen the inquisitor of Aragon [[Pedro de Arbués|Pedro of Arbués]]]]

In order to justify the attacks on the converts, it is affirmed that they are false Christians and that they are still practicing the Jewish religion in secret. According to Joseph Perez, it is a proven fact that, among those who converted to escape the blind furor of the masses in 1391, or by the pressure of the proselytizing campaigns of the early fifteenth century, some clandestinely returned to their old faith when It seemed that the danger had passed, of which it is said that ''Judaízan.'' The accusation of [[Crypto-Judaism]] becomes more plausible when some cases of prominent converts who continued to observe the Jewish rites after their conversion. But Joseph Judaizers, according to Joseph Perez, were a minority, although relatively important. The same affirms [[Henry Kamen]] when he says that "it can be affirmed that in the end of the 1470’s there was no Judaizing movement highlighted or proven among the converts." He also points out that when a convert was accused of judaizing, in many cases the "proofs" that were brought were in fact cultural elements of his Jewish ancestry - such as the Sabbath, not Sunday, as the day of rest - or the lack of knowledge of the new faith - such as not knowing the creed or eating meat in Lent - &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 44-46|ps = "Anyone who does not adapt to the rest of the community will be I saw as "Jew." Manuel Rodríguez, alchemist of Soria in the 1470’s, disdained the official religion, but the parish priest described him as "the wisest men in the world in all things." Precisely for this reason he was reputed, according to the testimony of an official, to be "Jewish"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is how the "convergent problem" is born. The baptized can not renounce their faith according to the canonical doctrine of the Church by which [[Crypto-Judaism]] is assimilated to [[heresy]], and as such must be punished. This is how they begin to claim various voices including those of some converts who do not want to question the sincerity of their baptism because of those "false" Christians who are beginning to be called [[Marrano]]. And it also extends the idea that the presence of the Jews among the Christians is what invites the converts to continue practicing the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1474 she acceded to the throne, married to the heir of the Crown of Aragon, the future [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], crypto-Judaism was not punished, "not, of course, by tolerance Or indifference, but because they lacked appropriate legal instruments to characterize this type of crime. "Thus, when they decide to confront the "converso problem", especially after the prior of the Dominicans of Seville, Fray [[Alonso de Ojeda]], in 1475 sent them an alarming report on the number of converts who in that city judaízan, even in an open way,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are addressed to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] to authorize them to appoint inquisitors in their kingdoms, which the pontiff grants them by the Bull "Exigit sincerae devotionis" of November 1, 1478. "With the creation of the tribunal of the Inquisition, the authorities will have the instrument and the means of in "According to Joseph Perez, Ferdinand and Isabella" were convinced that the Inquisition would compel the converts to integrate definitively: the day when all new Christians renounced Judaism nothing would distinguish them from the other members of the social body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The expulsion ==

=== The segregation of the Jews (1480) ===
[[File:IsabellaofCastile05.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando II of Aragon]].]]

From the beginning of his reign, Isabel and Ferdinand were concerned to protect the Jews - since they were "property" of the crown. For example, on September 6, 1477, in a letter addressed to the Jewish community of Seville, Queen Elizabeth I gave assurances about her safety:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| I take under my protection the Jews of the aljamas in general and to each one in particular, as well as to his people and their goods; I protect them against any attack, be it of the nature that is ...; I forbid that they attack, mate or hiera; I also prohibit a passive attitude if attacked, killed or injured.
Hence even the Catholic Kings until 1492 were reputed to be favorable to the Jews. This is what the German traveler, Nicolas de Popielovo says, for example, after his visit in 1484-1485:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 175}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His subjects of Catalonia and Aragon speak publicly and the same things I have heard say to many in Spain that the Queen is protector of the Jews and daughter of a Jewish woman}}
But the Catholic Monarchs could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested by the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; Obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at usurious interest, etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live In separate quarters, from where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith. A process for which a term of two years was established, but which lasted for more than ten years, and which was not exempt from problems and abuses by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp = 176-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text approved by the Cortes, which also included the [[Mudéjar|Mudejar]], read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We send to the aljamas of the said Jews and Moors that each of them who put in said apartment such diligence and give such order as within the said term of the said two years have said houses of their apart, and live and die in them, and henceforth do not have their dwellings among the Christians or elsewhere outside the circuits and places that would be deputies to the said Jewry and die.}}
The decision of the kings approved by the Courts of Toledo, had antecedents since the Jews already had been confined in some Castilian localities like Cáceres or Soria. In this last locality had been realized with the approval of the kings "to avoid dapnos [sic] that because of bevir and to dwell and to be the Jews among the christianos they followed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fray Hernando de Talavera, confessor of the queen and who had opposed the use of force to solve the "convergent problem", also justified the segregation "by avoiding many sins, which are followed of the mixture and a great deal of familiarity [between Christians and Jews] and of not keeping everything close to their conversation with Christians by [[Canon law|holy canons]] and civil laws is ordered and commanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Perez, with the decision to detain Jews in ghettos, it was not only a question of separating them from Christians and of protecting them, but also of imposing a series of obstacles on them in the development of their activities, so that they would not have more remedy "than to give up their status as Jews if they want to lead a normal existence. Their conversion is not demanded - not yet - nor is their autonomous statute touched, but they proceed with them in such a way that they end up convincing themselves that the only solution is conversion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The expulsion of the Jews from Andalusia (1483) ===
[[File:Cordoba sinagoga de cordoba.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of the [[Córdoba Synagogue]].]]

The first inquisitors appointed by the kings arrived in Seville in November 1480, "immediately sowing terror". In the first years and only for this city they dictate 700 death sentences and more than five thousand "reconciliations" - that is, prison sentences, exile or simple penances - that are accompanied by the confiscation of their property and the disqualification For public office and ecclesiastical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their inquiries the inquisitors discovered that for a long time many converts had met with their Jewish relatives to celebrate Jewish holidays and even attend synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=171-172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convinces them that they will not be able to put an end to crypto-Judaism if converts continue to maintain contact with the Jews, for example: what they ask the kings to be expelled from Andalusia. These approve and in 1483 give a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the ports of the Crown of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Julio Valdeón, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia also obeyed "the desire to move them away from the border between the crown of Castile and the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], scenario, during the eighties of the fifteenth century And the first years of the 1990s, of the war that ended with the disappearance of the last stronghold of peninsular Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p = 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The genesis of the expulsion decree ===
{{main|Alhambra Decree}}
[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|thumb|200px|Sealed copy of the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]].]]

On March 31, 1492, shortly after the end of the Granada war, the Catholic Kings signed the decree of expulsion of the Jews in Granada, which was sent to all the cities, towns and lordships of their kingdoms with orders strict to not read it or make it public until May 1.&lt;ref name = "Rumeu"&gt;{{cite book| last= Rumeu de Armas | first = Antonio | title = New light on the Santa Fe capitulations of 1492 between the Catholic Monarchs and Christopher Columbus: institutional and diplomatic study | page = 138-141 | editor = Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas | isbn = 9788400059613}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that some prominent Jews tried to nullify or soften it but did not have any success. Among these Jews stands out [[Isaac Abarbanel|Isaac Abravanel]] who offered King Ferdinand a considerable sum of money. According to a well-known legend when the Inquisitor General [[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]] found out, he presented himself before the king and threw a crucifix at his feet, saying: "Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver; His Majesty is about to sell it again for thirty thousand." According to the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu, quoted by Julio Valdeón, when Abravanel met with the Queen Isabella, she said to him: "'Do you think this comes from me? The Lord has put that thought into the heart of the King?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before a car of faith held in Avila in which three converts and two Jews condemned by the Inquisition were burnt alive for an alleged crime of ritual crime against a Christian child (who will be known as the [Child of the Guard] contributed to create the propitious environment for the expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009| pp = 185-186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Torquemada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]], first [[Grand Inquisitor|inquisitor general]].]]
The [[Catholic Monarchs|Catholic Kings]] had precisely entrusted to the [inquisitor general] [[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomás de Torquemada]] and its collaborators the writing of the decree fixing to them, according to the historian [[Luis Suárez Fernández|Luis Suarez]], three previous conditions Which would be reflected in the document: to justify the expulsion by charging Jews with two sufficiently serious offenses - usury and "heretical practice"; That there should be sufficient time for Jews to choose between baptism or exile; And that those who remained faithful to the Mosaic law could dispose of their movable and immovable property, although with the provisos established by the laws-they could not draw either gold, silver, or horses. Torquemada presented the draft decree to the kings on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada "demonstrates the leading role of [the Inquisition] in that matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez | 2009 | p = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the decree promulgated in Granada on March 31, which was based on the draft decree of Torquemada - drawn up "with the will and consent of their altezas" and which is dated in Santa Fe On March 20 - there are two versions. One signed by the two kings and valid for the Crown of Castile and another signed only by King Ferdinand and valid for the Crown of Aragon. Between the draft decree of Torquemada and the two final versions and between these, they exist, according to Joseph Perez, "significant variants." In contrast to the Torquemada project and the Castilian decree, in the version addressed to the Crown of Aragon the protagonism of the Inquisition is recognized - " Persuading us the venerable father prior of Santa Cruz [Torquemada], inquisitor general of the heretical staidness usury is mentioned as one of the two crimes of which the Jews are accused: "We find the Jewish sayings, by means of great and unbearable usages, to devour and absorb the properties and substances of Christians"; We reaffirm the official position that only the Crown can decide the fate of the Jews since they are the possession of the kings - "they are ours," it is said; And contains more insulting expressions against the Jews: they are accused of making fun of the laws of Christians and of considering them [[idolatry|idolaters]]; Mention is made of the abominable circumstances and of Jewish perfidy. The Judaism of "leprosy" is qualified; It is recalled that the Jews "by their own fault are subject to perpetual servitude, to be slaves and captives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez | 2009 | pp. 187-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the essentials the two versions have the same structure and expose the same ideas. The first part describes the reasons why the kings - or the king in the case of the "Aragonese" version - decide to expel the Jews and in the second part it is detailed how the expulsion is going to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The conditions of expulsion ===
The second part of the decree detailed the conditions for expulsion:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The expulsion of the Jews was final: "we agreed to send all Jews and Jews out of our kingdoms and never return or return to them or any of them."
# There was no exception, neither by reason of age, residence or place of birth - include both those born in Castile and Aragon and those from outside.
# There was a period of four months, which would be extended ten more days, until August 10, so that they would leave the kings' domains. Those who did not do so within that period or who returned later would be punished with the death penalty and the confiscation of their property. Likewise, those who aided or concealed the Jews were liable to lose "all their goods, vassals, and fortresses, and other inheritances."
# Within the set period of four months the Jews could sell their real estate and take the proceeds of the sale in the form of bills of exchange, not in coinage or gold and silver because their exit was prohibited by law - or merchandise - as long as they were not arms or horses, whose export was also prohibited.

Although the edict did not refer to a possible conversion, this alternative was implicit. As the historian [[Luis Suárez Fernández|Luis Suárez]] pointed out, the Jews had "four months to take the most terrible decision of their lives: to abandon their faith to be integrated in it [in the kingdom, in the political and civil community], or leave the territory in order to preserve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drama that lived the Jews is collected by a contemporary source:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Some Jews, when the term ended, went by night and day as in despair. Many turned from the road ... and received the faith of Christ. Many others, not depriving themselves of the country where they were born and for not selling their goods at that time at fewer prices, were baptized.}}
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e1 134-0.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Abravanel]].]]

The most outstanding Jews, with few exceptions among which the one of Isaac Abravanel stands out, decided to convert to the Christianity. The most relevant case was that of [[Abraham Senior]], the chief rabbi of Castile and one of the closest collaborators of the kings. He and all his relatives were baptized on June 15, 1492 in the Guadalupe monastery, being his godfathers the kings Isabel and Fernando. It took the name of Fernán Núñez Coronel and its son-in-law Mayr Melamed of Fernán Pérez Coronel - the same name of pile that the one of the king. In this case, like that of Abraham de Córdoba, he was given much publicity to serve as an example for the rest of his community. In fact during the four-month tacit term that was given for the conversion many Jews were baptized, especially the rich and the most educated, and among them the vast majority of the [[rabino|rabbis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chronicler of the time relates the intense propaganda campaign that unfolded:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In all the synagogues and in the squares and in the churches and in the fields, by the wise men of Spain, and was preached to them by the holy gospel and the doctrine of the holy Mother Church, and was preached and tested by their own Scriptures, how the Messiah who waited were Our Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ, who came in the time to be agreed, which his ancestors with malice they ignored, and all the others who came after them never wanted to give ear to the truth; before being deceived by the false book of the [[Talmud]], having the truth before their eyes and reading it in their law every day, they ignored it and ignored it.}}

The Jews who decided not to become "had to prepare themselves for the march in tremendous conditions". They had to sell their goods because they had very little time and had to accept the sometimes ridiculous amounts they offered them in the form of goods that could be carried away because the gold and silver output of the kingdom was prohibited - the possibility of taking [[Bills of exchange|bills of exchange]] were not much help because the bankers, Italians for the most part, demanded them enormous interests. A chronicler of the time attests this:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=112-113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They sold and squandered everything they could of their estates ... and in everything there were sinister ventures, and the Christians had their estates, very many and very rich houses and inheritances for few monies; and they prayed with them, and found not one to buy them, and gave a house for an ass and a vine for a little cloth or a linen cloth, because they could not bring forth gold or silver.}}
They also had serious difficulties in recovering the money lent to Christians because either the repayment term was after August 10, deadline for their departure, or many of the debtors denounced "usury fraud", knowing that the Jews, they would not have time for the courts to prove them right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=113-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the kings, the [[Ampudia]] Jews complained that "The mayors of the said village made them and have closed many unreason and grievances says that they do not consent to them, nor do they want them to pay and pay their personal property and that they have no less, but they want to make and pay the debts owed to them and that which they deem urge them to do and then pay them even if the deadlines are not reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File: Luis de Santangel.jpg |thumb|[[Luis de Santángel]], a Valencian convert who collaborated with [[Isaac Abarbanel]] in the organization of the journey of the expelled Jews.]]
In addition they had to take care of all the expenses of the trip - transport, maintenance, freight of the ships, tolls, etc. -. This was organized by Isaac Abravanel, who contracted the ships, having to pay very high prices and whose owners in some cases did not fulfill the contract or killed the travelers to steal what little they had. Avranel counted on the collaboration of the real official convert [[Luis de Santángel]] and of the banker genovés, [[Francisco Pinelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings had to give orders to be protected during the trip, because during the same suffered vexations and abuse. This is how [[Andrés Bernaldez]], pastor of [[Los Palacios]], the time when the Jews had to "abandon their land of their births":&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|All the young men and daughters who were twelve years old were married to each other, for all the females of this age above were in the shadow and company of husbands... They came out of the lands of their births, children, and children, old and young, on foot and knights on asses and other beasts, and on wagons, and continued their journeys each to the ports that were to go; and went by the roads and fields where they went with many works and fortunes; some falling, others rising, others dying, others being born, others becoming sick, that there was no Christian that there was no pain of them and always because they were invited to baptism and some, with their care, they became and remained but very few, and the rabbis worked them up and made the women and young men sing and play tambourines.}}

=== The reasons for the expulsion ===
[[File:Ferdinand of Aragon.jpg|thumb|left| [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].]]

{{quote|In the Castilian version reference is made exclusively to religious motives - in the Aragonese version it is also alluded to usury - because the Jews are accused of "heretical", i.e.: serve as an example and incite the [[Judeoconverse|convert]] to return to the practices of his ancient religion.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the beginning of the decree It is said that:
It is well known that in our domains there are some bad Christians who have Judaized and have committed apostasy against the holy Catholic faith, being the cause most by the relations between Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are the measures taken hitherto by kings to end the communication between the Jewish community and the converts, a fundamental cause according to the kings and the Inquisition, that the new Christians, first of all the agreement of the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 by which the Jews were forced to live in neighborhoods separated from the Christians, in order to prevent the Jews from "subverting and subtracting the Christian faithful from our holy Catholic faith." Secondly, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia, "believing that this would suffice for those of the other cities and towns and places of our kingdoms and lordships to cease to do and commit the aforesaid." But this measure failed" "because every day it is found and it seems that the said Jews grow in continuing their bad and damaged purpose where they live and talk.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the reason for deciding to expel the entire Jewish community, and not just those of its members who allegedly wanted to "pervert" the Christians, is explained:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because when a serious and detestable crime is committed by a college or university [i.e.: a corporation and a community], it is a reason for such a college or university to be dissolved, and annihilated, and the minors for the elders and the ones for the others punished and that those who pervert the good and honest living of cities and towns and by contagion can harm others to be expelled.}}

As highlighted [[Julio Valdeón]], "undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the [[history of Spain]]." It is not surprising, therefore, that historians have debated whether, in addition to the motives laid out by the Catholic Monarchs in the decree, there were others. Nowadays, some of those who argued at the time, such as the expulsion of the Jews to stay with their wealth, seem to have been discarded, since the majority of the Jews who left were the most modest, while the richest converted and they stayed, and on the other hand, the crown did not benefit at all from the operation - rather it was damaged because it stopped receiving the taxes paid by the Jews. Nor does the argument seem to hold that the expulsion was an episode of classes - the nobility wanted to get rid of an incipient bourgeoisie that represented the Jews and that supposedly threatened their interests - because many Jews were defended by some of the most important nobiliary families of Castile, and because he was also among the ranks of the "bourgeoisie" of "old Christians" where anti-Judaism grew the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|pp=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=117-118; 120-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal motives of the kings also seem to be ruled out, because everything indicates that they did not feel any repugnance towards Jews and converts. Among the trusted men of the kings were several who belonged to this group, such as the confessor of the queen [[Hernando de Talavera|fray Hernando de Talavera]], the steward [[Andrés Cabrera]], the treasurer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] [[Abraham Senior]], or as Mayr Melamed or [[Isaac Abarbanel]], without counting the Jewish doctors that attended them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Expulsión judíos.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsion of European Jewish communities between 1100 and 1600. The main routes that followed the Spanish Jews are marked in light brown.]]
Current historians prefer to place expulsion in the European context and stand out, such as [[Luis Suárez Fernández]] or Julio Valdeón, that the Catholic Kings were in fact the last of the sovereigns of the great western European states to decree The expulsion-the Kingdom of England did it in 1290, the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] in 1394; in 1421 the Jews are expelled from [[Vienna]]; in 1424 of [[Linz]] and of [[Cologne|Colonia]]; in 1439 of [[Augsburg]]; in 1442 of [[Bavaria]]; in 1485 of [[Perugia]]; in 1486 of [[Vicenza]]; in 1488 of [[Parma]]; in 1489 of [[Milan]] and [[San Luca|Luca]]; in 1493 of [[Sicily]]; in 1494 of [[Florence]]; in 1498 of Provenza...-.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of all of them was to achieve unity of faith in their states, a principle that will be defined in the sixteenth century with the formula "[[cuius regio, eius religio]]", that the subjects should profess the same religion as their prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|pp=89; 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joseph Perez pointed out, the expulsion "puts an end to an original situation in Christian Europe: that of a nation that consents to the presence of different religious communities" with which it "becomes a nation like the rest in Christendom European". "The [[University of Paris]] congratulated Spain for having carried out an act of good government, an opinion shared by the best spirits of the time ([[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Guicciardini]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]])... [...] it was the so-called medieval coexistence that missed Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julio Valdeón affirms that the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, who "showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews," was due to "pressure from the rest of Christianity" and to "the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called "deicides", as well as the "tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community." In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian [[Benzion Netanyahu]] that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. "Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?" Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term "usury", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, ritual crimes ... do not appear in any of the three versions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=125-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Joseph Perez, the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, as evidenced by the content of the [[Alhambra Decree|Granada Edict]], is directly related to the "converso problem". The first step was the creation of the Inquisition, the second the expulsion of the Jews to eliminate those who allegedly incited the converts to Judaize. "What concerned them [the kings] was the total and definitive assimilation of the converts, for which the previous measures failed; they resort to a drastic solution: the expulsion of the Jews to start evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea of expelling the Jews is part of the Inquisition, of which there is no doubt ... The Inquisition found the expulsion of the Jews the best way to put an end to the Judaizing converts: removed the Catholic Monarchs take the idea to their own account, but this does not mean that the pressure of the inquisitors is low. Heresy is not to their liking, they want to "clean" their kingdom, as the queen wrote, but these concerns are also political: they hope that the elimination of Judaism will facilitate the definitive assimilation and integration of converts into Spanish society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=128-129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Joseph Perez, following Luis Suárez, places the expulsion within the context of the construction of the "modern state," which requires greater social cohesion based on unity of faith to impose its authority on all groups and individuals of the kingdom. Unlike the medieval period in this type of state, it does not fit the groups that are governed by particular norms, as was the case of the Jewish community. It is therefore not a coincidence, Pérez warns, that only three months after having eliminated the last Muslim stronghold of the peninsula with the conquest of the Nazari kingdom of Granada, they decree the expulsion of the Jews. "What was intended then was to completely assimilate Judaizers and Jews so that there would be no more than Christians. Kings must have thought that the prospect of expulsion would encourage Jews to become massively and that a gradual assimilation would do away with the remnants of Judaism". The vast majority chose to leave, with all that entailed of tears, sacrifices and vexations, and to remain faithful to their faith. "They totally refused to assimilate as an alternative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=129-132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "assimilation" is in this quotation a euphemism: what was offered to the Sephardic was in fact the conversion to a faith that was not his own, hence his Emigration in mass (towards the different directions indicated in the attached map).

== Consequences ==

=== The end of religious diversity in Spain ===
[[File:Monumentoalatolerancia.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to Tolerance]] in [[Seville]], located in the place where five Jews were burned alive.]]
[[File:Sephardic family in Bosnia, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Sephardic family of Bosnia [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|ottoman Bosnia]] (19th century).]]

As Joseph Perez pointed out, "In 1492 the story of Spanish Judaism ends, which will only lead to an underground existence, always threatened by the Spanish Inquisition and the suspicion of a public opinion that saw In Jews, Judaizers and even sincere converts to natural enemies of Catholicism and Spanish idiosyncrasy, as understood and imposed by some ecclesiastical and intellectual leaders, in an attitude that bordered on racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of expelled Jews remains controversial. The figures ranged from 45,000 to 350,000, although the most recent investigations, according to Joseph Perez, place it at around 50,000, taking into account the thousands of Jews who left after returning because of the mistreatment they suffered in some places in Fez, Marruecos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julio Valdeón, citing also the latest investigations, places the figure between 70,000 and 100,000, of which between 50,000 and 80,000 would come from the [[Crown of Castile]], although in these numbers the returnees are not counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of those who returned was regularized with an order of November 10, 1492, in which it was established that civil and ecclesiastical authorities had to be witnesses to baptism, and in the event that they had been baptized before returning, evidence and testimonials that confirm it. They were also able to recover all their goods for the same price at which they had sold them. Returns are documented at least until 1499. On the other hand, a provision of the Royal Council of October 24, 1493, determined harsh sanctions for those who reviled these new Christians - calling them "transgressors," for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the economic impact of the expulsion, it seems to be ruled out that it was a hard setback and stopped the birth of capitalism, which would be one of the causes of the decline of Spain. As Joseph Perez has pointed out, "in view of the published literature on taxation and economic activities, there is no doubt that the Jews were no longer a source of relevant wealth, neither as bankers nor as renters nor as merchants who developed the expulsion of the Jews produced problems at the local level but not a national catastrophe. It is clearly unreasonable to attribute to that event the decadence of Spain and its supposed inability to adapt to the transformations of the modern world. What we now know shows that sixteenth-century Spain was not precisely an economically backward nation. [....] In strictly demographic and economic terms, and apart from human aspects, the expulsion did not imply for Spain any substantial deterioration, but only a temporary crisis Quickly overtaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=118-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of the Amsterdam Gazette published in the Netherlands on September 12, 1672. The Hebrews of Amsterdam printed a newspaper showing the interest of the Jewish community in what was happening at that time in Madrid and , It also read the news in Spanish - after 180 years of being expelled from its ancestral soil (1492).&lt;ref&gt;La historia de los judíos en ''Sefarad'' (hebreo: España) se remonta a los tiempos de la [[Edad Antigua|Antigüedad]] e involucra a los súbditos del rey [[Salomón]] y a otros tantos exiliados del [[Reino de Judá]] (Toledo, Sinagoga del Tránsito, ''La vida judía en Sefarad'', noviembre 1991—enero 1992; publicación del Ministerio de Cultura de España, pp. 19-20).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Sephardic diaspora and the Jewish identity continuity ===
Most of the expelled Jews settled in [[North Africa]], sometimes via [[Portugal]], or in nearby states, such as the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], or in the Italian states. As of the first two kingdoms also they were expelled to them in 1497 and in 1498 respectively, they had to emigrate again. Those of Navarre settled in [[Baiona, Pontevedra|Bayona]] for the most part. And those of Portugal ended up in northern Europe (England or Flanders).

In North Africa, those who went to the [[Wattasid dynasty|Fez kingdom]] suffered all kinds of ill-treatment and were plundered, even by the Jews who had lived there for a long time. Those who fought the best were those who settled in the territories of the Ottoman Empire, both in North Africa and in the [[Middle East]], as in the [[Balkans]] and the [[Republic of Ragusa]], after having passed by [[Italy]]. The sultan gave orders to be welcomed and his successor [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Soliman the Magnificent]] exclaimed on one occasion referring to King Ferdinand: "You call him king who impoverishes his states to enrich the mine?" This same sultan commented to the ambassador sent by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] who marveled that "they had cast the Jews of Castile, because it was to throw the wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2013|P=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As some Jews identified Spain and the Iberian Peninsula with Biblical [[Sepharad]], the Jews expelled by the Catholic Monarchs took or received the name of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]]. These, in addition to their religion, They also kept many of their ancestral customs, and in particular they have preserved the use of the Spanish language, a language which, of course, is not exactly what was spoken in fifteenth-century Spain: like any living language, it evolved and suffered the passage of time, notable alterations, although the structures and essential characteristics remained those of the Castilian late medieval. [...] The Sephardi never forgot the land of their parents, sheltering for her mixed feelings: on the one hand, the resentment for the tragic ones events of 1492, on the other hand, walking the time, the nostalgia of the lost homeland ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About judeoespañol as a socio-cultural and identity phenomenon, Garcia-Pelayo and Gross wrote in the twentieth century:

{{quote|It is said of the Jews expelled from Spain in the s. XV and that preserve in the East the language and the Spanish traditions. The expulsion of the Jews [...] sent a large number of families out of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly from Andalusia and Castile, to settle in the eastern Mediterranean countries dominated by the Turks, where they formed colonies which have survived to this day, especially in [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] [...]. These families, generally composed of Sephardic elements of good social standing, have maintained their religion, traditions, language and even their own literature for four and a half centuries. The Spanish that they transported, the one of Castile and Andalusia of ends of century XV, removed from all contact with the one of the Peninsula, has not participated of the evolution undergone by the one of Spain and Spanish colonial America. His phonetics presents some archaic but not degenerate forms; Its vocabulary offers countless Hebrew, Greek, Italian, Arabic, Turkish, according to the countries of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón García-Pelayo y Gross, ''Pequeño Larousse Ilustrado'', Buenos Aires y México: Larousse, 1977, pp. 603-604.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">A '''Faith-based organization''' is an organization whose values are based on faith and/or beliefs, which has a mission based on social values of the particular faith, and which most often draws its activists (leaders, staff, volunteers) from a particular faith group. The faith to which the organization is relating to does not have to be academically classified as [[religion]]. The term "faith-based organization" is more inclusive than the term "[[religious organization]]" as it refers also to the non-congregation faith beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bielefeld|first=Wolfgang|last2=Cleveland|first2=William Suhs|date=2013-06-01|title=Defining Faith-Based Organizations and Understanding Them Through Research|url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/42/3/442|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=442–467|doi=10.1177/0899764013484090|issn=0899-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the ''Handbook of Religion and Health'' (published in 2001) is divided into 8 major parts that contain a total of 34 chapters. The book also contains an 11-page introduction, a 2-page conclusion, 95 pages of references, and a 24-page index. One reviewer described the book as "surprisingly readable" (p.&amp;nbsp;791&lt;ref name=plante01/&gt;).

The parts and chapters are shown in the adjacent table. Most chapters focus on reviewing and discussing the relation between religion and particular health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or depression. In two chapters, the authors present more encompassing theoretical models that they suggest may explain the generally favorable associations observed between religion and health:

*In chapter 15, on mental health, the authors theorize that the relation between religion and mental health outcomes may be mediated (causally explained) by stressful life experiences, as well as various other psychological factors that include coping resources and future goals.&lt;ref&gt;The authors state "The model in Figure 15.1 illustrates hypothesized pathways by which religion can influence mental health" (p. 222). Figure 15.1 (p. 223) shows interrelations between religion and 5 clusters of mental health outcomes as mediated by 1) stressful life experiences; 2) future goals, prior experiences, and world view; 3) coping resources; 4) cognitive appraisals; and 5) coping behaviors. The figure also shows a role for 6) genetics/biological factors; and 7) developmental factors.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In chapter 25, on physical health, the authors theorize that the religion / physical health relation may be mediated (causally explained) by mental health, social support, and health behaviors, which in turn may affect various physiological processes as well as disease detection and treatment compliance, which affect physical health.&lt;ref&gt;The authors state "On the basis of the research we have reviewed, we now develop a theoretical model to illustrate how religious beliefs and practices might impact physical health (see Figure 25.1)" (p. 389).&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors note that their model for effects on physical health 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
does not consider 'supernatural'... explanations... since such mechanisms (if they exist at all) act outside the laws of science as we know them today. We focus here on known psychological, social, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms by which religion may exert effects on physical health. (p. 389)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book's 34th and final chapter contains a 77-page table with systematic information about all 20th-century studies of religion and health. Topics are arranged in the order of the other chapters, and provide technical information such as the type of population, the number of subjects, the existence of a control or a comparison group, and a 1-to-10 rating or "grade" of the study's quality and rigor. The "reader thus gains a snapshot view of each study, can easily identify those with a variable of interest, and can reference back to the text to see what the authors have to say about it" (p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;ref name=cronin02/&gt;).

The ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' wrote that the authors of the ''Handbook of Religion and Health'' are
&lt;blockquote&gt;
well-regarded researchers in this maturing field... Their analysis of more than 1200
studies and 400 reviews is meticulous and balanced.... This is an unparalleled resource not only for physicians with an interest in the relationship between religion and health but perhaps even more for those who doubt its significance. All physicians should consider the possibility that something so meaningful to a large number of patients might also be good for their health. (pp.&amp;nbsp;465-6&lt;ref name=charles01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' also stated that "Studies are cited to illustrate the complexity and limitations of available knowledge," that "The authors offer theoretical models for how religion might directly or indirectly influence both mental and physical health," and that "The authors provide an outline for a religious history that can serve as part of a clinical assessment. Ways to aid patients to use their religious beliefs within the health care system are suggested" (all p.&amp;nbsp;465&lt;ref name=charles01/&gt;).

In the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]]'', [[Leonard Duhl]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the authors have done a very thorough overview of all we know at this time. Clearly spirituality and religion affect growth and development, the creation of pathology and the treatment of disease. They have not got the total answer. However, they have laid a ground work for understanding a complex set of issues. They review those studies that exist, critically interpret their findings, and offer new ways of "asking the question." They hypothesise the possible mechanisms, and suggest new directions.
(p.&amp;nbsp;688&lt;ref name=duhl01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Gerontologist]]'', [[David O. Moberg]] described the book as "mind-boggling, comprehensive, and evenhanded...This comprehensive reference work deserves an honored place in every medical, religious, gerontological, professional, and scientific research library, even though it has one major weakness, the lack of an index of names." (pp.&amp;nbsp;699–700;&lt;ref name=moberg01/&gt;)

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Jerome Groopman]] wrote that the ''Handbook'''s conclusions 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
are not entirely encouraging: they suggest that although the relationship between health and spirituality is clearly worthy of serious study, much of the research done in the field to date has been shoddy. Koenig and his collaborators also go to great lengths to educate the reader about negative effects of belief and orthodoxies... such as the fear that disease is punishment for sin, and that assistance is preferably derived through miracles rather than through medicine. (p.&amp;nbsp;166&lt;ref name=groopman01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Freethought Today]]'', a magazine published by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]], wrote that the ''Handbook'' "reports that there are at least 1200 studies on religion and health - with the vast majority showing positive associations" and asked
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Are there really this many studies? What are these studies like? Well, here's one of them that qualifies by [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig's]] standards.... The authors reported differences between Jewish and non-Jewish Cleveland attorneys in the incidence of some index of cardiovascular disease. That's it.... So that's how numbers like 1200 arise, because studies like this get included. (pp.&amp;nbsp;10-11&lt;ref name=sloan07/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', [[Thomas G. Plante]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A growing number of well-conceived and methodologically rigorous studies have been conducted to examine if religious beliefs and behaviors might be related to health benefits or health risks....  No book, however, has &lt;nowiki&gt;[until now]&lt;/nowiki&gt; thoroughly reviewed all the empirical studies and reviews in this area.... The authors maintain scholarly neutrality and let the research evidence speak for itself.... The book is surprisingly readable for a 700+ page scholarly review.... The authors should be commended on an extraordinary job on this soon to be classic text.(pp.&amp;nbsp;790-1&lt;ref name=plante01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', Paul Genova wrote that "This ''Handbook'' is really a reference volume.... Case presentations are rare. Occasional sensitive discussions on subjects such as the adjustment to terminal cancer... are embedded in exhaustive literature reviews." But
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the biggest problem, in my view, with the line of reasoning represented by this book &lt;nowiki&gt;[is that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Health" is the ego's agenda. It should not be conflated with concepts such as doing God's will or taking one's proper place in a divine pattern.... A cultural product of present-day American behavioral science, this book renders unto the Caesar of controlled studies.... it fits the current pattern of assimilation and loses the Spirit of the message. (pp.&amp;nbsp;1619-20&lt;ref name=genova02/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'', Daniel Grossoehme, "a priest serving as a pediatric chaplain" (p.&amp;nbsp;800&lt;ref name=grossoehme02/&gt;), wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
now more than ever there is a need for religion and science (and specifically health science) to be in conversation with one another.... This volume is a significant contribution to the conversation and one which can be of great value in a variety of church settings.... The information contained in this volume provides the background necessary to carry on an education program that is both theologically and intellectually (scientifically) sound.... Guidance for previously unthought-of pastoral issues comes out from the studies. (p.&amp;nbsp;798&lt;ref name=grossoehme02/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]'', James W. Jones noted that "Like most medical texts, it is organized by syndromes" (p.&amp;nbsp;95&lt;ref name=jones05/&gt;), and that "the book’s clear organization" makes "selectively &lt;nowiki&gt;[reading]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the chapters of interest... easy to do" p.&amp;nbsp;96). He also stated that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have used this book successfully as part of the assigned readings in undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate courses on religion and health.... [it] is accessible to educated nonprofessionals as well as professionals in religion and medicine.... It is not, however, an introduction to the controversy surrounding the field. The authors do not explicitly argue for the religion–health relation; they are content to let the weight of evidence as they present it speak for itself.... For a more critical discussion, the reader must look to other sources. But anyone planning a course or introducing a colleague to the general field of religion and health should make this book available. (pp.&amp;nbsp;95-6&lt;ref name=jones05/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[First Things]]'' wrote that "The authors write in the desiccated tone of the social scientist who divorces his thought from the human encounter with the transcendent.... Nowhere in this tome does one find a statement (let alone any enthusiastic support for) the authentic place of religion in our being" (p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;ref name=mchugh01/&gt;).

The ''Journal of Hospice &amp; Palliative Nursing'' wrote that the authors "take on a Herculean task," and "every time I randomly opened to a page, I found something unanticipated and intriguing" (pp.&amp;nbsp;138,&amp;nbsp;139&lt;ref name=cronin02/&gt;).

The ''Journal of Sex Education &amp; Therapy'' wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a dip-and-dig book.... I spent a week just leafing through to savor the gems.... One day I read about depression... another delinquency, then cardiovascular disease... I spent a weekend on research methods and measurement tools and another weekend on priorities for future research. Yum. If you are looking for a doctoral project or an advisor, here is the place for you to dip and-dig. (p.&amp;nbsp;365&lt;ref name=cesaretti01/&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21081">{{Taoism}}
The history of [[Taoism]] stretches throughout Chinese history. Originating in prehistoric China, it has exerted a powerful influence over Chinese culture throughout the ages. Taoism evolved in response to changing times, with its doctrine and associated practices being revised and refined. The acceptance of Taoism by the ruling class has waxed and waned, alternately enjoying periods of favor and rejection. Most recently, Taoism has emerged from a period of suppression and is undergoing a revival in China.

[[Laozi]] is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoist religion and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he actually existed is disputed,&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; however, the work attributed to him - the Daodejing - is dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; However, Taoism clearly predates Laozi (Lao Tzu) as he refers to "The Tao masters of antiquity" in Chapter 15 of the Daodejing ([[Tao Te Ching]]). Moreover, the '''[[Yellow Emperor]],''' Huangdi (2697–2597 BCE) Is often associated with origin of the Tao.

Sinologist Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:
#[[Taoism#Categorization|Philosophical Taoism]], i.e. the ''[[Daodejing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''
#Techniques for achieving ecstasy
#Practices for achieving longevity or immortality
#Exorcism&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 25"/&gt;

Some elements of Taoism may be traced to [[prehistoric]] folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Demerath (2003), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucker (1995), pp. 203–04.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the [[Wu (shaman)]] (connected to the "shamanism" of Southern China) and the [[Fangshi]] (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to "... magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings" as well as exorcism; in the case of the ''wu'', "shamans" or "sorcerers" is often used as a translation.&lt;ref name="Robinet 1997, p. 36"/&gt; The ''fangshi'' were philosophically close to the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin-Yang]], and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Han Dynasty (206 BCE&amp;ndash;220 CE)==
The term ''Daojia'' (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism") was coined during the [[Han Dynasty]]. In [[Sima Qian]]'s history (chapter 63) it refers to immortals; in Liu Xiang it refers to Laozi and Zhuangzi (''Daojiao'' came to be applied to the religious movements in later times). The earliest commentary on the ''Dao De Jing'' is that of [[Heshang Gong]] (the "Riverside Master"), a legendary figure depicted as a teacher to the Han emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Han Dynasty, the Tao came to be associated with or conflated with the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Xian Di Emperor]]. A major text from the [[Huang-Lao]] movement would be the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', which interprets earlier works of the Taoist canon in light of the quest for immortality.

The first organized form of Taoism, the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] (Celestial Masters') school (later known as [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] school), developed from the [[Five Pecks of Rice]] movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by [[Zhang Daoling]], who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler [[Cao Cao]] in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Masters' activities did hasten the downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now [[Sichuan]] province. The same could be said of their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning [[Yellow Turban]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Kingdoms Period (220&amp;ndash;265)==
During the [[Three Kingdoms Period]], the [[Xuanxue]] (Mysterious Wisdom) school, including [[Wang Bi]], focused on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought. Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to the present is the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching. In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain an important aspect of Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wangbi.htm Wang Bi [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six Dynasties (316&amp;ndash;589)==
Taoist alchemist [[Ge Hong]], also known as [[Baopuzi]] (抱扑子 The "Master Embracing Simplicity") was active in the third and fourth centuries and had great influence on later Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (上清 "Supreme Clarity") (365&amp;ndash;370) and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] (靈寶 "Sacred Treasure") scriptures (397&amp;ndash;402) received at Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong's; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (內觀 ''neiguan''). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the "[[Zhenren]]") many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, [[Tao Hongjing]] (456&amp;ndash;536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the [[Six Dynasties]] period, the Celestial Master movement re-emerged in two distinct forms. [[The Northern Celestial Masters]] were founded in 424 century by [[Kou Qianzhi]], and a Taoist theocracy was established that lasted until 450 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, the Northern Celestial Masters were expelled from the Wei court and re-established themselves at Louguan where they survived into the [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-289-290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Celestial Masters were centered at Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]], and were likely made of those adherents who fled Sichuan and others who fled from [[Luoyang]] after its fall in 311 CE. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Taoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters, who lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tang Dynasty (618&amp;ndash;907)==
Taoism gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was forced to compete with [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], its major rivals, for patronage and rank. Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] (685&amp;ndash;762), who ruled at the height of the Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people's lives they were not mutually exclusive. This marks the beginning of a long-lived tendency within imperial China, in which the government supported (and simultaneously regulated) all three movements.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]] added the ''Tao Te Ching'' to the list of classics (''jing,'' 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song Dynasty (960&amp;ndash;1279)==
Several Song emperors, most notably [[Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong]], were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the ''[[Daozang]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quanzhen]] school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the resurgent Celestial Masters called the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Song Dynasty]] saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (''daoshi'') and the local traditions of [[folk religion]] as practised by spirit mediums (''wu'') and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as ''fashi''.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the [[Celestial Heart Rites]] and the [[Thunder Rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 416-418, 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesised in the [[Neo-Confucian]] school, which eventually became Imperial [[orthodoxy]] for state bureaucratic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yuan Dynasty (1279&amp;ndash;1367)==
[[File:Baiyun.jpg|thumb|500px|White Cloud Monastery in Beijing]]
Taoism suffered a significant setback in 1281 when many copies of the ''Daozang'' were ordered burned. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Neidan]]'', a form of [[internal alchemy]], became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect, whose practitioners followed a monastic model inspired by Buddhism. One of its leaders, Qiu Chuji became a teacher of [[Genghis Khan]] before the establishment of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. (and used his influence to save millions of lives). Originally from [[Shanxi]] and [[Shandong]], the sect established its main center in [[Beijing]]'s [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] ("White Cloud Monastery").&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the dynasty, the Celestial Masters sect (and Buddhism) again gained preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ming Dynasty (1368&amp;ndash;1644)==
In 1406, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] emperor [[Zhu Di]] commanded that all Taoist texts be collected and combined into a new version of the ''Daozang.'' The text was finally finished in 1447, and took nearly forty years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing Dynasty (1644&amp;ndash;1912)==
The fall of the Ming Dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the [[Qing Dynasty]] by the Manchus was blamed by some literati on religion, specifically Taoism. They sought to regain power by advocating a return to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] orthodoxy in a movement called ''Hanxue'', or "[[Han Learning]]." This movement returned the Confucian classics to favor and nearly completely rejected Taoism. During the eighteenth century, the [[Siku Quanshu|imperial library]] was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (only one complete copy of the ''[[Daozang]]'' still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist Period (1912&amp;ndash;1949)==
[[Guomindang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) leaders embraced science, modernity, and Western culture, including (to some extent) Christianity. Viewing the popular religion as reactionary and parasitic, they confiscated some temples for public buildings, and otherwise attempted to control traditional religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China (1949&amp;ndash;present)==
The [[Communist Party of China]], officially atheistic, initially suppressed Taoism along with other religions. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and Monks and priests were sent to labor camps.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened.

Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |title= Human Rights Without Frontiers "Religious Freedom in China in 2006" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075017/http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |archivedate= 2009-03-27 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(30.6&amp;nbsp;KB)}} An address given to the Delegation EU-China of the European Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitive areas include the relationship of the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi]] Taoists with their sect's lineage-holder, who lives in Taiwan, and various traditional temple activities such as astrology and shamanism, which have been criticized as "superstitious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001211132/http://www.oslocoalition.org/html/project_china/report_china_visit_2000.html|archivedate=2007-10-01|title=Report from The Oslo Coalition "Visit to China"|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism in the West==
From 1927-1944, the chief proponent of Taoism in the West was Professor [[Henri Maspero]] in Paris. [[Michael Saso]] was the first westerner to be initiated as a Taoist priest; he subsequently served also as co-editor of ''Taoist Resources''. Today, many Taoist organizations have been established in the West.

"Popular Western Taoism" is a term coined by Jonathan R. Herman in his 1998 review of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Daodejing]]'' "rendition", referring to the
&lt;blockquote&gt;abundance of new literature on Taoism by nonspecialists, including "translations" of Taoist texts by authors who (sometimes boastfully) lack linguistic competence. Scholars have been quick to reject such documents as ahistorical and inauthentic, and many do indeed combine questionable scholarship with a promiscuous blend of western individualism and new-age universalism. However, this popular western Taoism is not exclusively or even primarily a scholarly phenomenon; rather, it is an ''aesthetic'', ''cultural'', and ''religious'' phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R.. 1998. "Review of Tao Te Ching: A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way". ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 66 (3). [Oxford University Press, American Academy of Religion]: 686–89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This review was largely positive with some criticisms and cautions. While Herman states that the book "is not a useful text for informing students" about philosophical thought during the Chinese [[Warring States period]],
Herman praised the book as a "surprisingly interesting and scholastically responsible" example of western Daoist thought and as "an intelligent example of the emerging western transformation of Taoism, an area too often overlooked by sinologists." On the other hand, he criticized that Le Guin "make[s] some claims—or rather, employs some language—that may carry misleading implications", such as identifying Laozi "as a mystic and his perceptions as mystical, without ever defining the terms or questioning what generalizations can be drawn."

Herman subsequently described popular Western Taoism as the modern proliferation of self-proclaimed Daoist journals, meditation centers, websites, and renderings of Daoist texts by nonspecialists; and said, "not surprisingly, the sinological community (myself included) has generally greeted this overall phenomenon – what I will from here on label "popular Western Daoism" – with varying degrees of indifferences, amusement, and derision."&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jonathan R. (2001), "Daoist Environmentalism in the West: Ursula K. Le Guin's Reception and Transmission of Daoism," in ''Daoism and Ecology'', ed. by N. J.

In a 1998 article about teaching Daoism, Russell Kirkland urged colleagues not to "Pooh-pooh Taoism" with "popular fluff" like Benjamin Hoff's coffee-table book ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]'', and characterized [[Stephen Mitchell (translator)|Stephen Mitchell]] and others as "self-indulgent dilettantes who deceive the public by publishing pseudo-translations of the ''Tao-te ching'', without having actually read the text in its original language".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirkland, "Teaching Taoism in the 1990s", ''Teaching Theology and Religion'', 1998, 1.2, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Komjathy described modern "Western Daoism" or "American Daoism" in [[religious studies]] terms, where "New Age discourse communities and advocates of Perennial Philosophy identify and interpret Daoist texts as part of a 'universal wisdom tradition'."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2004), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf Tracing the Contours of Daoism in North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226091433/http://www.daoistcenter.org/novareligio.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}, ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 8.2, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Komjathy later elaborated on these spiritual hybrids that "domesticate, sterilize and misrepresent Daoism", and may best be understood as part of a [[new religious movement]] labeled "Popular Western Taoism (PWT), with 'Taoism' pronounced with a hard 't' sound."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010), [http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html Popular Western Taoism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211110432/http://www.daoistcenter.org/pwt.html |date=2015-12-11 }}, Center for Daoist Studies. This refers to the common {{IPA|/ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/}} mispronunciation of English ''Taoism'' {{IPA|/ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/}} (see [[Daoism–Taoism romanization issue]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In this construct, "'Daoism' becomes anything for anyone", and Popular Western Taoism "has little to no connection with the Daoist religious tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, Louis (2010),  [http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html Popular Construction of Daoist Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125122245/http://www.daoistcenter.org/daoist3.html |date=2015-11-25 }} , Center for Daoist Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">'''Infallibilism''', in [[epistemology]], is the idea that propositional [[knowledge]] is incompatible with a chance of being wrong, where this is typically understood as one's evidence or justification providing one's [[belief]] with such strong grounds that it must be [[truth|true]] and perhaps cannot be rationally doubted. Other beliefs may be rationally [[Theory of justification|justified]], but they do not rise to the level of ''knowledge'' unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, [[fallibilism]], is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. 

Fallibilism is not to be confused with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. [[René Descartes]], an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meditations on First Philosophy|last = Descartes|first = Rene|publisher = |year = 1641|isbn = 978-0-415-07707-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as "if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Descartes/DescartesInfallibilismCartesiancircle.pdf|title = Infallibilism and the Cartesian circle|last = Lacewing|first = Michael|date = 2013|journal = A Level Philosophy|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/dbt560/Fallibilism.pdf|title = How to Think about Fallibilism|date = 7 June 2001|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = University of Washington Course Server|publisher = |last = Reed|first = Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Mark Kaplan, "If you know you can't be wrong," in {{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Stephen |title=Epistemology Futures |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=180-198 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KAPIYK}}; see also {{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-010-9815-2|title = Warrant does entail truth|last = Moon|first = Andrew|date = 2012|journal = Synthese|doi = 10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015|volume=184|pages=287–297}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to Be an Infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, Hope, and Fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], under which the [[Pope]] is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches "infallibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F96-1.html|title = The History and Future of Papal Infallibility|last = Burke|first = Ronald|date = Fall 1996|work = |access-date = Oct 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of [[bishop]]s as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.com/tracts/papal-infallibility|title = Papal Infallibility|date = August 10, 2004|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Catholic Answers|publisher = |last = Brom|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Innocent}}
[[Image:Bouguereau-Linnocence.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]'s ''L'Innocence'':  Women, young children and lambs are all symbols of innocence.]]
[[File:Prud'hon, Pierre Paul - Venus Bathing or Innocence - c. 1810.JPG|thumb|''Innocence'' by [[Pierre Paul Prud'hon]], circa 1810]]
'''Innocence''' is a lack of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], with respect to any kind of [[crime]], or wrongdoing. In a [[Criminal law|legal context]], innocence is to the lack of [[guilt (law)|legal guilt]] of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

==In relation to knowledge==
Innocence can imply lesser [[experience]] in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale.  In contrast to ''[[ignorance]]'', it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong.  This connotation may be connected with a popular [[false etymology]] explaining "innocent" as meaning "not knowing" (Latin ''noscere'' (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix ''in-'' and the Latin ''nocere'', "[[to harm]]".

People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior.  From this meaning comes the usage of ''innocent'' as a noun to refer to a child under the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]], or a person, of any age, who is severely [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]]. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults &lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah, 1977-.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.

==Pejorative meaning==
In some cases, the term "innocence" has a [[pejorative]] meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience.  Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.

==Symbolism==
The [[domestic sheep|lamb]] is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In [[Christianity]], for example, [[Jesus]] is referred to as the "Lamb of God", thus emphasizing his sinless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Freemasonry: Its Symbolism, Religious Nature, and Law of Perfection'' (March 10, 2003)|isbn=978-0766142015|publisher=By [[Chalmers I. Paton]] (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symbols of innocence include [[child]]ren, [[virginity|virgins]], [[acacia]] branches (especially in [[Freemasonry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Numismatist'' (1903)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Numismatist.html?id=WpEUAAAAYAAJ|publisher=By [[American Numismatic Association]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color [[white]] (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_Americana.html?id=r8BPAAAAMAAJ|publisher=By [[Encyclopedia Americana|Encyclopedia Americana Corporation]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of innocence==
A "loss of innocence" is a common theme in [[fiction]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[Literary realism|realism]]. It is often seen as an integral part of [[coming of age]]. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Levitt |url=http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html |title=Interpretation of American Pie - analysis, news, Don McLean, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=Missamericanpie.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetry like [[William Blake]]'s collection [[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]] and novels like ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

By contrast, the [[I ching|''I Ching'']] urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and "encourages you to ''actively practice innocence''".&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Walker trans, ''The I Ching or Book of Changes'' (1993) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the "loss" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with "innocence", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to "white childhood" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from "innocence" but from childhood as well.

==In psychoanalysis==
The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition is broadly divided between those (like [[W. R. D. Fairbairn|Fairbairn]] and [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or [[psychological trauma]]; and those (like [[Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]) who see the child as ''developing'' innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the [[Oedipus complex]] and/or the depressive position.&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt;

More eclectically, [[Eric Berne]] saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and "the sweet phrases of charming innocence".&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In a rather different formulation, [[Christopher Bollas]] used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;S. Cavanagh, ''Skin, Culture and Psychoanalysis'' (2013) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; - something akin to what he calls "the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sidelights==
*In ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'', a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the 'woman-in-love'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ivy Compton-Burnett]] had one character conclude dourly of another two that "you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives".&lt;ref&gt;I. Compton-Burnett, ''The Last and the First'' (1971) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Humanist and Ethical Union''' ('''IHEU''') is an umbrella organisation of [[Humanism|humanist]], [[atheist]], [[rationalist]], [[secular]], [[skeptic]], [[freethought]] and [[Ethical Culture]] organisations worldwide.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iheu.org/about |title= About IHEU|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher= IHEU }}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher and biologist [[Julian Huxley]] (also the first director of [[UNESCO]]) presided over the founding Congress of the IHEU in [[Amsterdam]], 1952; Dutch philosopher and politician [[Jaap van Praag]] became its first chairman until 1975.

The IHEU works "to build and represent the global Humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes Humanist values world-wide."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/about-iheu/|title=IHEU {{!}} About IHEU|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the [[Amsterdam Declaration 2002|Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002, which presents as the "official defining statement of World Humanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/content/amsterdam-declaration-2002|title=Amsterdam Declaration 2002|publisher=IHEU|accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Happy Human]] is the official symbol of the IHEU.

IHEU holds a [[World Humanist Congress]] usually every three years. The next is to be held in [[Miami]], [[United States]], in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/about/general-assembly/|title=General Assembly {{!}} IHEU|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanism as a life stance==
In 2002 at the IHEU's 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress, delegates unanimously passed a resolution known as the [[Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002, an update of the original Amsterdam Declaration (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freethought resource guide: a directory of information, literature, art, organizations, &amp; internet sites related to secular humanism, skepticism, atheism, &amp; agnosticism|last=Vandebrake|first=Mark|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781475020359|location=Austin, Texas|pages=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amsterdam Declaration defines Humanism as a "[[Life stance|lifestance]]" that is "ethical", "rational", supportive of "democracy and human rights", insisting "that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility"; it is "an alternative to dogmatic religion"; it values "artistic creativity and imagination" and is aimed at living lives of "fulfillment" through the powers of "free inquiry", "science" and "creative imagination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/|title=IHEU {{!}} The Amsterdam Declaration|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[Amsterdam Declaration]]'s "official statement of World Humanism", the IHEU provides a "Minimum Statement on Humanism":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanism/what-is-humanism/|title=IHEU {{!}} What is Humanism?|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and [[ethical]] life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Member Organisations of the IHEU are required according to IHEU's membership regulations to have objects that are "consistent" with this understanding of Humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Regulations-on-membership-categories-and-dues.docx|title=Regulations on membership categories and dues|last=|first=|date=|website=Iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Humanism}}

=== Other major resolutions ===
In 2010, in an "unprecedented alliance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/sakulare-werte-fur-europa-brusseler-erklarung-zu-wurde-gleichheit-und-freiheit-153481705.html|title=Säkuläre Werte für Europa: Brüsseler Erklärung zu Würde, Gleichheit und Freiheit /PR Newswire UK/|last=Choice|first=Catholics for a Free|website=www.prnewswire.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the IHEU, the [[European Humanist Federation]] and [[Catholics for Choice]], launched the [[European Humanist Federation#A Vision for Europe and the Brussels Declaration|Brussels Declaration]], a secular response to a proposed [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]], under which the [[Treaty of Lisbon|amended EU Constitution]] would have made references to "[[God]]" and the "[[Christianity|Christian]] roots of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://humanistfederation.eu/ckfinder/userfiles/files/position/Secular%20europe/The%20Brussels%20Declaration.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214104351/http://humanistfederation.eu/ckfinder/userfiles/files/position/Secular%20europe/The%20Brussels%20Declaration.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At World Humanist Congress 2011, in Norway, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oslo Declaration on Peace, which concludes: "We urge each of our member organizations and Humanists globally to work for a more peaceful culture in their own nations and urge all governments to prefer the peaceful settlement of conflicts over the alternative of violence and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/oslo-declaration-peace/|title=IHEU {{!}} The Oslo Declaration on Peace|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At World Humanist Congress 2014, in the United Kingdom, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression, which asserts: "Freedom of thought implies the right to develop, hold, examine and manifest our beliefs without coercion, and to express opinions and a worldview whether religious or non-religious, without fear of coercion. It includes the right to change our views or to reject beliefs previously held, or previously ascribed. Pressure to conform to ideologies of the state or to doctrines of religion is a tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;[http://iheu.org/oxford-declaration-on-freedom-of-thought-and-expression/ IHEU, ''Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression'', 12 August 2014]. Retrieved 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==

=== Founding in 1952 ===
Five Humanist organisations, the [[American Ethical Union]], [[American Humanist Association]], British Ethical Union (later the British Humanist Association and now [[Humanists UK]]), Vienna Ethical Society and the Dutch Humanist league hosted the founding congress of the IHEU in Amsterdam, 22–27 August 1952.&lt;ref name="IHEU1952"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/content/1850-1952-road-founding-congress|title=1850-1952: The road to the founding congress|publisher=IHEU|accessdate=2 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811030040/http://iheu.org/content/1850-1952-road-founding-congress|archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skepticism and humanism : the new paradigm|last=Kurtz|first=Paul|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2001|isbn=0765800519|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the congress five resolutions were passed, which included a statement of the fundamentals of "modern, ethical Humanism", a resolution which would come to be known as the [[Amsterdam Declaration]] (1952).&lt;ref name="IHEU1952" /&gt;

=== Current structure ===
[[File:IHEYO logo.png|thumb|left|150px|IHEYO logo.]]
The IHEU is a democratic organisation,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; the Board of which is elected by representatives of the Member Organisations at annual General Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/general-assembly/|title=IHEU {{!}} General Assembly|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President as of 2015 is [[Andrew Copson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2015/06/01/andrew-copson-elected-new-president-of-the-international-humanist-and-ethical-union/|title=Andrew Copson elected new President of the International Humanist and Ethical Union|date=2015-06-01|website=British Humanist Association|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is also the Chief Executive of [[Humanists UK]] as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/staff/|title=Senior Staff|date=2012-04-27|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHEU headquarters is in London, sharing an office with Humanists UK.

Representatives of IHEU Member Organisations ratify new memberships annually during a General Assembly. Following the 2017 General Assembly, the IHEU listed its membership as 139 Member Organisations from 53 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/membership/our-members/?page=CiviCRM&amp;q=civicrm/profile&amp;page=CiviCRM&amp;gid=4&amp;force=1&amp;crmSID=4_u&amp;crmRowCount=25&amp;crmPID=1|title=IHEU {{!}} Our members|last=|first=|date=|website=iheu.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a variety of non-religious traditions.

A staff of four is headed by the current Chief Executive, Gary McLelland, and the IHEU maintains delegations to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in Geneva, the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations in New York]], and the [[Council of Europe]] in Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/staff-and-representatives/|title=IHEU {{!}} Staff and Representatives|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU is an international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] with Special Consultative Status with the [[United Nations]], General Consultative Status at the [[Council of Europe]], Observer Status with the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]], and maintains operational relations with [[UNESCO]].

IHEU has a wing for people aged up to 35 called the [[International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation]] (IHEYO).

The name of the IHEU may soon change, as delegates at the organization's 2017 General Assembly passed a resolution "mandating the Board to oversee a transition to a revised identity for the organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/tears-joy-iheu-general-assembly-2017/|title=Tears and joy at IHEU General Assembly 2017|date=2017-08-10|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategy and activities ==
The aim of the IHEU is to "build, support and represent the global humanist movement, defending human rights, particularly those of non-religious people, and promoting humanist values world-wide".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/vision-and-mission/|title=IHEU {{!}} Vision and mission|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a campaigning NGO the IHEU aims "to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Freedom of Thought Report ===
[[File:Freedom of Thought Report 2016 cover image.png|thumb|Cover of the downloadable 2016 edition of the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report - Key Countries Edition]]
In 2012 the IHEU began publishing an annual report on "discrimination against humanists, atheists and the non-religious" called The Freedom of Thought Report.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/new-global-report-discrimination-against-non-religious/|title=IHEU {{!}} New global report on discrimination against the non-religious|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report centres around a "Country Index" with a textual entry for every [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/|title=Country Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country is measured against a list of 64 boundary conditions, which are categorised into four thematic categories ("Constitution and government", "Education and children's rights", "Family, community, society, religious courts and tribunals", and "Freedom of expression, advocacy of humanist values") at five levels of overall "severity" ("Free and equal", "Mostly satisfactory", "Systemic discrimination", "Severe discrimination" and "Grave violations").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/ratings-system/|title=The Ratings System|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 64 boundary conditions include for example: "‘Apostasy’ or conversion from a specific religion is outlawed and punishable by death", which is placed at the worst level of severity, and under the category "Freedom of expression", and: "There is state funding of at least some religious schools", which is a middle severity condition, under the category "Education and children's rights". The data from the report is freely available under a [[Creative Commons license]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/data/|title=Open Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Findings of the Freedom of Thought Report ====
In 2017, the report found that 30 countries meet at least one boundary condition at the most severe level ("Grave violations"), and a further 55 countries met at least one boundary condition in the next most severe level ("Severe discrimination").&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Map of discrimination against the non-religious in the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report.png|alt=Map of results from the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report|center|thumb|500x500px|This composite map overlays the results from four separate categories of assessment in the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report, as to how countries discriminate against non-religious people. Countries block-filled in darker, redder colors are rated more severely in the report, while lighter, greener shades are more "free and equal".]]

==== Responses to the Freedom of Thought Report ====
The various annual editions of the Freedom of Thought Report have been reported in the media under headlines such as: "How the right to deny the existence of God is under threat globally" (the [[The Independent|Independent]], UK);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/how-the-right-to-deny-the-existence-of-god-is-under-threat-globally-9913662.html|title=The right to deny the existence of God is under threat|date=2014-12-09|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Most countries fail to respect rights of atheists – report" ([[Christian Today]]); and "[[Stephen Fry]]'s mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries" (the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/05/stephen-frys-mockery-of-religion-could-land-him-the-death-penalty-in-these-countries/|title=Stephen Fry's mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report has received coverage in the national media of countries that are severely criticised, for example "Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under 'serious assault', study shows" (the [[Malay Mail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malaysias-free-thought-religious-expression-under-serious-assault-study-sho|title=Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under ‘serious assault’, study shows|date=2015-12-21|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forewords and prefaces to the various annual editions of report have been written by then-[[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief|United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief]], [[Heiner Bielefeldt]], in 2012; two victims of "blasphemy" accusations, [[Kacem El Ghazzali]] and [[Alber Saber]] in 2013; human rights defenders [[Gulalai Ismail]] and Agnes Ojera in 2014; humanist activist and survivor of an [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh#Attacks on secularists|anti-secularist machete attack in Bangladesh]], [[Rafida Ahmed Bonya]] (2015); and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief|United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief]], [[Ahmed Shaheed]], in 2016. In 2015 and 2016 the annual edition of the Freedom of Thought Report was launched at the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] hosted by the [[Intergroups in the European Parliament|European Parliamentary Intergroup]] on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance chaired by [[Dennis de Jong|Dennis de Jong MEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiousfreedom.eu/2015/12/10/forb-free-thought-report-intergroup-meeting/|title=FoRB Free Thought Report Intergroup meeting {{!}} Religious Freedom {{!}} European Parliament Intergroup|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiousfreedom.eu/2016/12/06/new-report-shows-persecution-of-adherents-of-non-theistic-and-atheist-beliefs-in-the-world-on-the-rise/|title=New report shows: Persecution of adherents of non-theistic and atheist beliefs in the world on the rise {{!}} Religious Freedom {{!}} European Parliament Intergroup|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to the first edition of the Freedom of Thought Report, [[Heiner Bielefeldt]] wrote: "As a universal human right, freedom of religion or belief has a broad application. However, there seems to be little awareness that this right also provides a normative frame of reference for atheists, humanists and freethinkers and their convictions, practices and organizations. I am therefore delighted that for the first time the Humanist community has produced a global report on discrimination against atheists. I hope it will be given careful consideration by everyone concerned with freedom of religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/|title=Freedom of Thought Report {{!}} Documenting discrimination against the non-religious around the world|website=freethoughtreport.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a panel event at the [[European Parliament]] for the launch of the 2015 edition, Bielefeldt said he "unambiguously welcomed" the report and reiterated with regard to "[[freedom of religion or belief]]" that it is "only a kind of short-hand", and "Formulations such as "religious freedom" obfuscate the scope of this human right which covers the identity-shaping, profound convictions and conviction-based practices of human beings broadly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheus-freedom-of-thought-report-2015-why-should-we-pamper-saudi-arabia-for-oil/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU's Freedom of Thought Report 2015… "Why should we pamper Saudi Arabia for oil?"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was the subject of a question in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] in 2013, to which [[David Lidington]] MP responded for the government asserting, "Our freedom of religion or belief policy is consistent with the key message of the International Humanist and Ethical Union's (IHEU) report: that international human rights law exists to protect the rights of individuals to manifest their beliefs, not to protect the beliefs themselves. The report records a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for alleged criticism of religion by atheists on social media. Protecting freedom of expression online is a priority for the British Government and we have consistently argued against attempts to create a new international standard in order to protect religions from criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0005.htm#13101522000057|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 14 Oct 2013  (pt 0005)|last=Westminster|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freedom of Thought Report and Islamophobia ====

The IHEU denies it is an Islamophobic organisation, and that its criticism of the tenets of Islam is an acceptable use of freedom of speech &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iheu.org/criticism-of-islamic-tenets-not-the-same-as-islamophobia-argues-iheu/ |title=Criticism of Islamic tenets not the same as Islamophobia, argues IHEU }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The 2018 Freedom of Thought report &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freethoughtreport.com/download-the-report/ |title=The Freedom of Thought Report 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which focuses mainly on the treatment of religious and non-religious minorities in Muslim countries, has, however, been condemned for being openly Islamophobic in its coverage of the application of ''[[Sharia]]''-based laws in the Islamic Republic of Iran &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiachat.com/forum/topic/235060135-humanist-organisation-iheu-publishes-islamophobic-report/ |title= Humanist organisation (IHEU) publishes Islamophobic report}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The report, which was largely unsourced, and whose research methodology is not given, cited the "testimony" of an atheist woman claiming that atheists in Iran were being sentenced to death for admitting their lack of belief: no cases involving the prosecution of persons in Iran simply for declaring their atheism have been reported by civil rights groups. The report also made a number of other spurious and dubious claims such as that members of the Baha'i sect, which is not recognised as a religion in Iran, could be killed with impunity under Islamic law and that atheists could be put to death for the crime of ''[[Moharebeh]]'' (waging war on God), even though this refers only to those who violently taken up arms against the authorities and not the non-religious or religious dissenters. Like many other human rights groups, the report confuses ''[[Sharia]]'' - the Muslim code of practice and way of life - with the implementation of corporal punishments (Hadd/Hudud) such as flogging and amputation. Muslims have repeatedly objected to the way in which the ''[[Sharia]]'' that they follow is caricatured in terms of certain physical penalties like these &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/sharia_1.shtml |title=BBC Sharia}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Focus of advocacy and campaigns ===
Recurring themes of the IHEU's advocacy and campaigns work include [[LGBTI rights]] and [[women's rights]], [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]], laws against [[blasphemy]] and [[apostasy]], [[caste]]-based discrimination, [[slavery]], and advocacy of [[secularism]].

==== Persecuted non-religious individuals ====

Individuals persecuted for expressing their non-religious views (actual or perceived) have frequently been the subject of IHEU campaigns. Some prominent cases include:
* In the 1990s IHEU was instrumental in highlighting the threats against [[Taslima Nasrin]] who lives in exile from [[Bangladesh]], and who also acted as a representative of the IHEU at [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/taslima-nasrins-visit-india/|title=IHEU {{!}} Taslima Nasrin's Visit to India|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The IHEU and [[Amnesty International]] led the campaign in 2004 to try to obtain the release of [[Younus Shaikh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/28/stories/2004012812620400.htm | title = Ethical approach to a humane cause | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = January 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was accused of "[[blasphemy]]" in [[Pakistan]].
* In 2013 the IHEU urged the authorities in [[Egypt]] to ensure the safety of [[Alber Saber]] after he was accused of "offending religion" for allegedly linking to the [[YouTube]] video "[[Innocence of Muslims]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-urges-calm-and-safeguarding-alber-saber-while-bail/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU urges calm and safeguarding of Alber Saber while on bail|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 the IHEU blew the whistle on the case of [[Irreligion in Nigeria|Mubarak Bala]] from [[Nigeria]], who was detained in a psychiatric hospital after he talked openly about being an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28010234|title=Nigeria atheist Bala 'deemed mentally ill' in Kano state|date=2014-06-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/nigerian-man-locked-up-atheist|title=Nigerian man is locked up after saying he is an atheist|last=Smith|first=David|date=2014-06-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-18|last2=correspondent|first2=Africa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was freed following international media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28158813|title=Nigeria atheist Bala freed from Kano psychiatric hospital|date=2014-07-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, after a government minister in [[Malaysia]] said members of an atheist meetup group would be "hunted down"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/malaysia-government-minister-atheists-hunted-down-reeducated-religious-freedom-shahidan-kassim-a7884766.html|title=Government minister wants to 'hunt down' atheists in Malaysia|date=2017-08-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the IHEU called for respect of the atheists' human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-deplores-backlash-hunt-atheists-malaysia/|title=IHEU deplores backlash and "hunt" against atheists in Malaysia|date=2017-08-08|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the organization's condemnation of the minister's remarks was reported in Malaysian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/minister-violating-human-rights-by-hunting-atheists-says-humanist-group|title=Minister violating human rights by ‘hunting’ atheists, says humanist group|date=2017-08-09|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IHEU delegation at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] has repeatedly raised the imprisonment and corporal punishment of [[Raif Badawi]] for "insulting religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=raif+badawi|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: raif badawi|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Waleed Abulkhair]] for "disrespecting the authorities",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=waleed|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: waleed|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[Saudi Arabia]].

The IHEU similarly highlights cases where individuals are accused of "[[apostasy]]", such as the blogger [[Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir]] currently on death row in [[Mauritania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-condemns-death-sentence-for-apostasy-handed-to-writer-in-mauritania/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU condemns death sentence for "apostasy", handed to writer in Mauritania|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the poet [[Ashraf Fayadh]] currently imprisoned in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/death-for-apostasy-must-not-stand-free-ashraf-fayadh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Death for "apostasy" must not stand! Free Ashraf Fayadh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 at the 32nd session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] the IHEU's delegate took the unusual step of reading one of Ashraf Fayadh's poems during General Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-reads-poem-banned-in-saudi-for-apostasy-to-delegates-at-un/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU reads poem banned in Saudi for ‘apostasy’ to delegates at UN|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bangladesh machete murders ====
{{See also|Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh}}
The IHEU complained that fundamentalists linked to the government were "terrorising" secular activists, including individuals in connection with IHEU Member Organisations, as far back as 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/bangladesh-secular-intellectuals-terrorised-islamic-fundamentalists/|title=IHEU {{!}} Bangladesh: secular intellectuals terrorised by Islamic fundamentalists|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|a series of machete attacks primarily targeting secular and atheist bloggers and freethinkers in Bangladesh]] has been especially severe since 2013, and the IHEU has campaigned persistently in response&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=bangladesh|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the murders at the UN Human Rights Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/at-human-rights-council-iheu-raises-plight-of-bangladeshi-atheist-bloggers/|title=IHEU {{!}} At Human Rights Council, IHEU raises plight of Bangladeshi Atheist bloggers|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU responded in 2013 to the murder of blogger and activist [[Ahmed Rajib Haider]] and the machete attack on his friend [[Asif Mohiuddin]], and highlighted the subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Mohiuddin and others for "hurting religious sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/arrests-atheist-bloggers-shows-bangladesh-authorities-are-walking-trap-set-fundamentalists/|title=IHEU {{!}} Arrests of "atheist bloggers" shows Bangladesh authorities are "walking into a trap set by fundamentalists"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/prominent-atheist-blogger-remains-danger-pending-blasphemy-trial-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Prominent atheist blogger remains in danger pending blasphemy trial in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/call-action-defend-bloggers-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Call to action: Defend the bloggers of Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When author and prominent leader of the Bengali freethought movement [[Avijit Roy]] was murdered, 26 February 2015, the IHEU revealed that he had been advising them on the situation in Bangladesh; the IHEU's Director of Communications commented, "This loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world. He was a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanists-appalled-at-the-murder-of-secular-activist-and-writer-avijit-roy/|title=IHEU {{!}} Humanists appalled at the murder of secular activist and writer Avijit Roy|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Washiqur Rahman Babu]] (or Oyasiqur Rhaman), 30 March 2015, the IHEU republished some of his final writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/no-i-will-not-write-about-war-crimes-islamic-extremism-the-country-or-politics-anymore/|title=IHEU {{!}} "No, I will not write about war crimes, Islamic extremism, the country or politics anymore"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Ananta Bijoy Das]], 12 May 2016, the IHEU leaked parts of the letter Bijoy Das had recently received from [[Sweden]] rejecting his visa application, despite his having being invited to the country by Swedish [[PEN International|PEN]]. The IHEU highlighted "the failures of the Bangladeshi authorities to bring to justice the individuals and to break the networks behind this string of targeted killings", and also criticised Sweden's rejection of his visa application, commenting, "We call on all countries to recognise the legitimacy and sometimes the urgency and moral necessity of asylum claims made by humanists, atheists and secularists who are being persecuted for daring to express those views."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/third-atheist-writer-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh-this-year/|title=IHEU {{!}} Third atheist writer hacked to death in Bangladesh this year|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Niladri Chattopadhyay Niloy]] (or Niloy Chatterjee, also known by his pen name Niloy Neel), 7 August 2015, the IHEU again attacked the government and authorities, saying, "Apparent failure to pursue the most obvious lines of inquiry even when initial arrests are made, and [[media manipulation]] resulting in conflicting stories, further makes reportage difficult and police operations opaque."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/niloy-neel-fourth-atheist-activist-murdered-in-a-year-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Niloy Neel – Fourth atheist activist murdered in a year in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coordinated attack against two separate publishing houses in [[Dhaka]], 31 October 2016, killed the publisher [[Faisal Arefin Dipon]] and seriously injured the publisher [[Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/coordinated-machete-attack-on-publishers-of-secular-authors-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Coordinated machete attack on publishers of secular authors in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHEU later published an interview with Chowdhury about the attack and his escape to [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/tutul-the-survivor-an-interview-with-the-target-of-a-bangladesh-machete-attack/|title=IHEU {{!}} Tutul: the Survivor – An interview with the target of a Bangladesh machete attack|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 the IHEU coordinated a joint open letter in English and Bangla by a coalition of "Bloggers, free speech campaigners, humanist associations, religious and ex-Muslim groups"&lt;ref name="iheu.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/huge-alliance-protests-government-response-to-bangladesh-blogger-murders/|title=IHEU {{!}} Huge alliance protests government response to Bangladesh blogger murders|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/08/19/global-free-speech-campaigners-protest-against-blogger-killings-in-bangladesh|title=Global free speech campaigners protest against blogger killings in Bangladesh|newspaper=bdnews24.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling on the president and prime minister of Bangladesh to "ensure the safety and security of those individuals whose lives are threatened by Islamist extremists... instruct the police to find the killers, not to harass or blame the victims... disassociate yourself publicly from those who call for death penalties against non-religious Bangladeshis..." and repeal the laws under which secular bloggers faced arrest and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="iheu.org"/&gt;

Following the murder of a student and secular activist [[Nazimuddin Samad]], 6 April 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/atheist-student-nazimuddin-samad-killed-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Atheist student Nazimuddin Samad killed in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the murder of university lecturer Professor [[Murder of A. F. M. Rezaul Karim Siddique|Rezaul Karim Siddique]], 23 April 2016, the IHEU's president Andrew Copson said "Unless the government [of Bangladesh] immediately begins to defend the right to speak and write freely, without adding the unprincipled and anti-secular qualifications that it keeps applying to freedom of expression, then very soon the only voices that will be heard will be those of murderous extremists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/academic-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Academic hacked to death in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU, along with the IHEU Member Organisation the [[Humanistisch Verbond|Dutch Humanist Association]], and [[Hague Peace Projects]], organised a "solidarity book fair" in The Hague, 26 February 2016, to coincide with the annual [[Ekushey Book Fair]] in Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/europe-stands-with-bangladeshi-atheists-at-solidarity-book-fair-in-the-hague/|title=IHEU {{!}} Europe stands with Bangladeshi atheists at Solidarity Book Fair in The Hague|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of targets for these attacks began to broaden in the later part of 2015 and throughout 2016 to more often include minority religious individuals and foreigners, culminating in the [[July 2016 Dhaka attack]] in [[Gulshan Thana]].

==== End Blasphemy Laws campaign ====
In January 2015, in part as a response to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], the IHEU alongside other transnational secular groups the [[European Humanist Federation]] and [[Atheist Alliance International]] and a two-hundred strong organisational coalition, founded the End Blasphemy Laws Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/end-blasphemy-laws-campaign-launched-by-international-coalition-1.2085483|title=End Blasphemy Laws campaign launched by international coalition|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/end-blasphemy-laws-a-new-campaign/|title=IHEU {{!}} End Blasphemy Laws – a new campaign|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; End Blasphemy Laws is "campaigning to repeal "blasphemy" and related laws worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://end-blasphemy-laws.org/about/|title=About {{!}} End Blasphemy Laws|website=end-blasphemy-laws.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other campaigns ====
The "First World Conference on Untouchability" was organised by the IHEU in [[London]], June 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/global-initiative-against-untouchability-launched-london/|title=IHEU {{!}} Global initiative against untouchability launched in London|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the event, the [[BBC News]] quoted then-Executive Director of the IHEU [[Babu Gogineni]] as saying that legal reforms alone would not end caste discrimination: "There are Dalit politicians in India, but nothing has changed. The answer is to educate Dalits and empower them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8089287.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Is caste prejudice still an issue?|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was preceded by questions in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/parliamentary-questions-precede-first-world-conference-untouchability-london-june-9-10/|title=IHEU {{!}} Parliamentary questions precede first World Conference on Untouchability in London, June 9 &amp; 10|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guests included [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Lord Desai]] and [[Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] from the UK [[House of Lords]]; [[Binod Pahadi]], Member of the [[Legislature Parliament of Nepal|Constituent Assembly, Nepal]]; and Tina Ramirez, US Congressional Fellow on International Religious Freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Second World Conference on Untouchability was held in [[Kathmandu]], in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-supports-second-world-conference-on-untouchability/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU supports Second World Conference on Untouchability|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the IHEU criticised the US-based [[Appeal of Conscience Foundation]] for awarding their "World Statesman Award" to then-president of [[Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]; IHEU argued that the award "is a slap in the face to prisoners of conscience across the world. While [[Alexander Aan]] suffers in an Indonesian jail for posting his beliefs to Facebook, his jailer will be honored in New York as a champion of freedom of belief."

In 2014 the IHEU as part of a "coalition of secular groups" led a campaign around the hashtag "#TwitterTheocracy" to protest the social media website [[Twitter]]'s implementation of tools blocking "blasphemous" tweets in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/twittertheocracy-campaign-after-social-network-blocks-blasphemy-in-pakistan/|title=IHEU {{!}} #TwitterTheocracy campaign after social network blocks "blasphemy" in Pakistan|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2014/06/twitter_censors_1.html|title=Twitter censorship targeted with hashtag activism - Tech Digest|date=2014-06-10|newspaper=Tech Digest|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enochian angels''' are entities described in the [[Enochian magic]] system, introduced in the sixteenth century by [[John Dee]] (1527–1608) and [[Edward Kelley]] (1555–1597).

==History==
John Dee was born a Christian, and this can be seen throughout his journals and his "Enochian" system of Angel Magic.  Therein, we find an obvious belief in the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son and Holy Spirit).  We also find a fourth Supreme Being in the figure of "Galvah" (Omega) &amp;mdash; who is also called the Mother, Wisdom and "I AM" in Dee's journals.  This figure is known in Judaism as the [[Shekhinah]] &amp;mdash; Divine Presence; to the Gnostics as [[Sophia (name)|Sophia]] &amp;mdash; Wisdom; and to the Hermetic Qabalah as Aima Elohim &amp;mdash; Mother of the gods. Compare [[Theotokos]], Mother of God, in Catholic beliefs.

Beneath these four Divinities are several hierarchies of [[angel]]s, or intelligent rulers, set over such things as the Planets, the Stars and the four Quarters of the Earth.

The angels of the four quarters are symbolized by the "Watchtowers" &amp;mdash; four large magical word-square Tables (collectively called the [[Great Table of the Earth]]).  Most of the well-known Enochian Angels are drawn from the Watchtowers of the Great Table.

Each of the four Watchtowers is collectively governed by six Seniors (aka Elders) &amp;mdash; making a total of 24 Elders as seen in the [[Revelation of St. John]].  Each Watchtower is further divided into four sub-quadrants, where we find the names of various Archangels and Angels who govern the quarters of the world.  In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with living intelligences.

==The angelic names contained in the Watchtowers==
The names of the Enochian angels are drawn from a number of enciphered tables, received through the "spirit actions" of John Dee, Edward Kelly, and occasionally another scryer.  The Watchtower set of angels is one of the larger and better developed sets.  A problem arises in that there are several variations on the Watchtowers themselves and several ways of drawing the names therefrom.  The four Watchtowers were first received on 25 June 1584.  This arrangement and order is reflected in Dee's prayer - The Fundamental Obeisance.  They were then rearranged slightly and corrected in the days following: 26 June through 2 July 1584; this arrangement corresponds to the majority of prayers in Sloane MS. 3191 (The Book of Earthly Victory and Science) and is what is given in the published versions of that text, notably Geoffrey James' ''Enochian Evocation'' / ''Magick'' and Robert Turner's ''Elizabethan Magic''. Late in the course of Dee and Kelly's work together, on 19 April 1587, the [[Archangel Raphael]], was said to have appeared, and reformed the Watchtowers, rearranging their order and directions and making some minor corrections.  It is this arrangement that is used in the Golden Dawn and subsequent derivatives such as [[Thelema]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Church of Satan]]. The Golden Dawn also follows a slightly different method of drawing forth some of the names from the Tables. The Golden Dawn method of extracting the names, is heavily influenced by the post Dee text contained in Sloane MS. 307 and published by Stephen Skinner and David Rankine as ''Practical Angel Magic of Dr John Dee's Enochian Tables''.  For convenience sake, in identifying these variations when they differ, the received set is labelled Received, the set reflected in Sloane MS. 3191 is labelled Orthodox, the set reformed by Raphael as Reformed and the variations used by the Golden Dawn as GD. The Angelic Hierarchies of the Watchtowers are also set out in several visions of Edward Kelly's and enshrined in a Talisman constructed by John Dee, published in ''A True &amp; Faithful Relation'' and on display in the [[British Museum]] collection.

His lawyer claimed 13 Satanic [[coven]]s existed in the area, holding bizarre orgies involving children, and that Gozenton had been followed and threatened by "coven" members throughout the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Humphries | title = Child Sex Abuse Linked With Satanism: Police | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 1991-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Melbourne diocese of the [[Catholic Church]] acknowledged as "substantially true" allegations that a Melbourne priest took part in Satanic ritual abuse in which a number of deaths occurred in the 1960s, and paid compensation to a surviving victim.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hughes, Church pays victim of sex and death rituals: Priest's satanic life, Herald Sun, 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Coast, New South Wales===
In 1999, two journalists from the Sun-Herald claimed to have seen evidence of the ritual abuse of children. They interviewed six mothers whose children had disclosed experiences of SRA and organised abuse in New South Wales. The children's disclosures were corroborating, although they had never met one another, and they had been able to draw representations of "Satanic" ritual sites which were similar to ritual sites uncovered by police on the central coast of New South Wales. One mother stated that her sons remembered being drugged and hypnotised. "He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out," she said. "I know they're  dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight."&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Wood and martin Chulov, Evil In The Woods, The Sun Herald, 8 August 1999, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Superior Universal Alignment, an Argentinian-based international cult, was implicated in the ritualistic murders of several children. One of the leaders of the group, Osvaldo Marcineiro, confessed to murdering a number of young children in Satanic rituals in which the children were tortured and their body parts cannibalised. A number of prominent citizens were arrested in relation to the murders, and it later emerged that they had paid the cult to conduct the murderous ceremonies. A search of cult member's houses turned up cult registers, guns, hooded cloaks, 100 videotapes of cult ceremonies and satanist publications, including a 200-page book by cult leader Valentina de Andrade called ''God, the Great Farce''. Brazilian authorities suggested that the cult was connected to Satanic groups internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, ''The [[Associated Press]]'', 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, five members of the Superior Universal Alignment cult in the Amazonian town of Altamira were convicted for the ritualistic murders of three children and the castration of two others. The victims were aged between eight and thirteen years, and they were kidnapped, tortured or killed between 1989 and 1993. Their genitals were removed and used in Satanic rituals by 75-year old village clairvoyant, Valentina de Andrade, the leader of the Superior Universal Alignment cult.&lt;ref&gt;Gamini, Gabriella, "Seer for trial in voodoo murders", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; De Andrade had previously been sought by police in Argentina and Uruguay prior to her arrest in Brazil on suspicion of involvement in other satanic ritual killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Cultic Studies Association|The Cult Observer]] (American Family Foundation), Vol. 10 No. 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the castration of victims, two doctors involved in the sect removed the victim's other organs for sale on the international black market. Other people sentenced in relation to the murders included a former police officer, a businessman and the son of an influential landowner. The charges related to the murders of three young children and the attempted murder of another, however, victim's families say that there were at least nineteen other murdered children. The cult is based in Argentina and has branches in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor gets 56 years for Brazil sect killings, 11 September 2003, [[Reuters]] News and Five&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 a group of parents published allegations in a conservative magazine that their children had witnessed SRA and had been ritually abused from May, 1987 until October 1988 in [[Oude Pekela]], a city in the north-eastern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[the Netherlands]].  During the initial investigation, only the non-ritual aspects were reported in the press and investigated by the authorities and the allegations were unconfirmed.  In 1989 the [[Conservatism|conservative]] Christian news program ''Tijdsein'' reported allegations that included Satanic ritual abuse, to which there was no official response.  After attending a conference in which the concept of satanic ritual abuse was discussed, Oude Pekela [[general practitioner]]s Fred Jonker and Ietje Jonker-Bakker alleged that several children had been abused by unknown men in the context of Satanic rituals.

No evidence was found of Satanic apparatus, and charges were dismissed when a court ruled the allegations were untrue. The children who were removed from their homes sued the city council in 2006 for compensation and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last=Lewis |authorlink= |title= 'Satanic abuse' case families sue council for negligence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1684205,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-01-12 |accessdate = 2007-10-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orkney===
{{Main|South Ronaldsay child abuse scandal}}
In 1990-1991 nine children suspected of being sexually abused by their families and an alleged child abuse ring were removed by social services in [[Orkney]]. The abuse was also alleged to involve "ritualistic elements".&lt;ref name = Orkney&gt;{{cite news | title = Orkney abuse scandal victim to sue for lost youth | last = Thompson | first = Tanya | publisher = [[The Scotsman]] | date=  2006-09-11 | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=860&amp;id=1338842006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parents approached the media and made the case national and international news. In April 1991, a [[Sheriff Principal|sheriff]] ruled that the evidence was seriously flawed and the children were returned home.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

In June, social services appealed the sheriff's ruling&lt;ref name="BBC April 4"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = 1991: Orkney 'abuse' children go home | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = BBC News "On This Day" | date = 1991-04-04| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/4/newsid_2521000/2521067.stm | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the appeal was overturned and an official inquiry was established in August 1991, which after 9 months' investigation at a cost of £6 million, published its report in October 1992. It described the dismissal of the first judgment as "most unfortunate" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgment were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of "ritual abuse" was "not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Gillian | authorlink = | title = Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 2005 | location = | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp91ArpXcH0C&amp;pg=PA287 287] | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-57806-789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lord Clyde | year = 1992 | title = The Report of the Inquiry into the Removal of Children from Orkney in February 1991 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 government report based on three years of research found that there was no foundation to any of the Satanic abuse claims.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

===Broxtowe===
In October 1987 children were removed from their families in Nottingham, and in February 1989 a [[Broxtowe, Nottingham|Broxtowe]] family was charged with multigenerational child sexual abuse and neglect. A 600-page report on the incident concluded that there was no evidence of the SRA claims made by children or corroborating adults. Though the children may have been 'sadistically terrorized', allegations of organized Satanic abuse were found to be baseless and the indicators used by the Social Services department were without validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Thorpe | first = W. |author2=Gwatkin, J.B. |author3=Glenn, W.P. |author4=Gregory, M.F. | date=  1990-06-07 | title = Revised Joint Enquiry Report | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~dlheb/jetrepor.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | publisher = Nottinghamshire Social Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewis===
In 2003 allegations by three children in [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Scotland]] resulted in the arrest of eight people for sexual abuse occurring between 1990 and 2000.

===Kidwelly===
In March 2011, four adults who lived in a cul-de-sac in the Welsh town of [[Kidwelly]] were convicted of multiple sex offences against children and young adults. The group led by Colin Batley was described by the media as a "Satanic sex cult", a "quasi-religious sex cult" and a "paedophile cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-12677043|title=Kidwelly sex cult: Town unaware of 'evil paedophile'|date=9 March 2011|work=BBC News South West Wales|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Colin Batley, leader of sex cult preying on children, could spend life in jail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/sex-cult-leader-colin-batley-sentenced|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the group members were not followers of [[Satanism]].   The prosecution said they practised "[[promiscuity|free sex]]" and were influenced by [[Aleister Crowley]], a practitioner of [[ceremonial magic]] who founded the belief system of [[Thelema]]. They dressed in hoods and read from Crowley's ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central text of [[Thelema]] and some victims were made to wear [[inverted cross]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |title=Five found guilty in sex cult trial |last=Turner |first=Robin |date=9 March 2011 |work=WalesOnline |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707070344/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the cult were initiated in a ceremony involving sex with an adult, and they were threatened with being killed if they did not take part in the ceremony.

==United States==
{{Main|Kern County child abuse cases|McMartin preschool trial|Ricky Kasso|West Memphis 3|Little Rascals Day Care Center|Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial|Pace memorandum}}
In the [[United States]], major allegations of Satanic ritual abuse occurred in the [[Kern County child abuse cases]], [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the [[West Memphis 3]], which garnered world-wide media coverage. It was eventually determined that no satanic abuse ever took place in these cases due to false testimony and police misconduct. There have been countless, debunked allegations of SRA in the United States; of which the most recent allegation was [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|Pizzagate]]; a speculated pedophile ring in the Washington D.C area at supposed ping pong themed restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. In the allegations, [[Hillary Clinton]] was an avid supporter and member in the pedophilia ring, with various sources of selected evidence pointing to her possible involvement and the possible involvement of Clinton's associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/pizzagate-a-deep-dish-slice-of-fake-news-delusion/article33282231/|title=Pizzagate: A deep-dish slice of fake news delusion|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minnesota===
The first such case occurred in [[Jordan, Minnesota]], in 1983, where several children made allegations against an unrelated man and their parents. The man confessed and then identified a number of the children’s parents as perpetrators. Ultimately twenty-four adults were charged with child abuse though only three went to trial with two [[acquittal]]s and one [[conviction]].&lt;ref name = Scalia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-478.ZD.html | title = Supreme Court Collection at Cornell University Law School | last = Scalia | first = Antonin | authorlink = Antonin Scalia |author-link2=William J.

Albuguergue, NM  | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, the children made [[allegation]]s regarding the manufacturing of [[child pornography]], ritualistic animal sacrifice, [[Coprophagia#Humans|coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hechler, David |title=The battle and the backlash: the child sexual abuse war |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-669-14097-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No criminal charges resulted from the FBI investigation, and in his review of the case, the [[Attorney General]] noted that the initial investigation by the local police and county attorney was so poor that it had destroyed the opportunity to fully investigate the children’s allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Humphrey | first = Herbert | year = 1985 | title = Report on Scott County investigations | location = Minneapolis, MN | publisher = Minnesota Attorney General's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the Minnesota case in his summation on a later case, and stated, "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged," and cited the repeated, well-intentioned but coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.&lt;ref name = Scalia/&gt;  The bizarre allegations of the children, the ambiguities of the investigation and the unsuccessful prosecutions were widely covered by the media. A number of accused parents confessed to sexually abusing their children, received immunity, and underwent treatment for sexual abuse, while parental rights for six other children in the case were terminated.&lt;ref name=Faller2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Faller, K.C. | year = 2004 | title = Sexual Abuse of Children: Contested Issues and Competing Interests | journal = Criminal Justice Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 358 | url = http://cjr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/29/2/358  | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | doi = 10.1177/073401680402900206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[world]]'s principal [[religion]]s and spiritual traditions may be classified into a small number of major groups, although this is by no means a uniform practice. This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative levels of civility in societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tomoko |last=Masuzawa |title=The Invention of World Religions |location=Chicago [[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-50989-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of religious categories==
[[File:Civilization and religion map 1821.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1821 map of the world, where "Christians, Mahometans, and Pagans" correspond to levels of civilization (the map makes no distinction between Buddhism and Hinduism).]]

In world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] mentions three different categories: Muslims, the [[People of the Book]], and [[Idolatry|idol worship]]ers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, "[[heresy]]" was clarified to mean [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]];{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwuUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|title=Twentieth-Century Marxism: A Global Introduction|last=Glaser|first=Daryl|last2=Walker|first2=David M.|date=2007-09-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135979744|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[paganism]], this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as [[John Toland]]'s ''Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nazarenusorjewis00tola|title=Nazarenus, or, Jewish, gentile, and Mahometan Christianity : containing the history of the antient Gospel of Barnabas, and the modern Gospel of the Mahometans ... also the original plan of Christianity explain'd in the history of the Nazarens ... with the relation of an Irish manuscript of the four Gospels, as likewise a summary of the antient Irish Christianity|last=Toland|first=John|last2=La Monnoye|first2=Bernard de|date=1718-01-01|publisher=London : J. Brotherton, J. Roberts and A. Dodd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represented the three [[Abrahamic religions]] as different "nations" or sects within ''religion'' itself, the "true [[monotheism]]."

[[Daniel Defoe]] described the original definition as follows: "Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=Religion%20is%20properly%20the%20Worship%20given%20to%20God,%20but%20'tis%20also%20applied%20to%20the%20Worship%20of%20Idols%20and%20false%20Deities&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of "religion" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, "religions," to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, [[Hannah Adams]]'s early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from ''An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...'' to ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations''.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005. pp. 49–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=hannah%20adams&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, [[Mohammedan|Mahommedan]]ism (archaic terminology for [[Islam]]) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by [[Josiah Conder (editor and author)|Josiah Conder]]'s ''Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind''. Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes [[Druze]], [[Yazidi|Yezidi]]s, [[Mandaeism|Mandeans]], and [[Elam]]ites{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=What does he mean by that? In modern usage, the Elamites are an ancient people.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Josiah%20Conder's%20Analytical%20and%20Comparative%20View%20of%20All%20Religions%20Now%20Extant%20among%20Mankind&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a list of possibly monotheistic groups, and under the final category, of "polytheism and pantheism," he listed [[Zoroastrianism]], "Vedas, Puranas, Tantras, Reformed sects" of India as well as "Brahminical idolatry," [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|Lamaism]], "religion of China and Japan," and "illiterate superstitions" as others.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005, pp. 65–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Josiah%20Conder%20illiterate%20superstitions&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern meaning of the phrase "world religion," putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]]. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as [[William James]], [[D. T. Suzuki]], and [[Alan Watts]], who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005, 270–281&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, the category of "world religion" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. L. Clark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20019386 "World Religions and World Orders"]. ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious studies]]'' 26.1 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching "world religions" in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Joel E. Tishken. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/495028 "Ethnic vs. Evangelical Religions: Beyond Teaching the World Religion Approach"]. ''The History Teacher'' 33.3 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the "[[invented traditions|invention of traditions]]."

** [[Abrahamic religions]] are the largest group, and these consist mainly of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. They are named for the patriarch [[Abraham]], and are unified by the practice of monotheism.

* [[Indian religions]], originated in [[Greater India]] and partly of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] origins, they tend to share a number of key concepts, such as [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[reincarnation]] among others. They are of the most influence across the [[Indian subcontinent]], East Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as isolated parts of Russia. The main Indian religions are [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. 
* [[East Asian religions]] consist of several East Asian religions which make use of the concept of ''[[Tao]]'' (in Chinese) or ''[[Dō (philosophy)|Dō]]'' (in Japanese or Korean). They include many [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as [[Religion in Korea|Korean]] and [[Shinto|Japanese religion]] influenced by Chinese thought.

* Indigenous [[ethnic religion]]s, found on every continent, now marginalized by the major organized faiths in many parts of the world or persisting as undercurrents ([[folk religion]]s) of major religions. Includes [[traditional African religion]]s, Asian [[shamanism]], [[Native American religion]]s, [[Austronesian peoples#Religion|Austronesian]] and [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian Aboriginal]] traditions, [[Chinese folk religion]]s, and postwar [[Shinto]]. Under more traditional listings, this has been referred to as "[[paganism]]" along with [[Polytheism#Historical polytheism|historical polytheism]].
* [[New religious movement]] is the term applied to any religious faith which has emerged since the 19th century, often [[syncretism|syncretizing]], re-interpreting or reviving aspects of older traditions such as [[Ayyavazhi]], [[Mormonism]], [[Ahmadiyya]], [[Pentecostalism]], [[polytheistic reconstructionism]], and so forth.

==Religious demographics==
{{Further information|List of religious populations}}
{{Main category|Religious demographics}}

One way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.

There is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:

* Whether to count "historically predominant religious culture[s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| accessdate = 2006-10-12

| author = worldvaluessurvey.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether to count only adults, or to include children as well.
* Whether to rely only on official government-provided statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = United Nations Statistics Division - Demographic and Social Statistics
| url =http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/popchar/popcharMeta.aspx

A '''meditation''' (derived from the  [[Latin languages|Latin]]  ''[[:wikt:meditatio|meditatio]]'', from a verb ''[[:wikt:meditor|meditari]]'', meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder") is a written work or a discourse intended to express its author's reflections, or to guide others in contemplation.  Often they are an author's musings or extended thoughts on deeper philosophical or religious questions.

Examples of meditations are:
* [[Thomas Traherne]]'s ''Centuries of Meditations''
* [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]''
* ''[[Meditations]]'' a series of personal writings by [[Marcus Aurelius]], Roman Emperor 161–180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy
* ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' by [[René Descartes]]

[[File:Kamogawa_ceremony_02.jpg|thumb|Miko perform Shinto ceremony near the [[Kamo River]]]]

In [[Shinto]], a '''''miko''''' ([[wiktionary:巫女|巫女]]) is a shrine ([[Shinto shrine|jinja]]) maiden&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"&gt;Groemer, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston, 101&lt;/ref&gt; or a supplementary [[priest]]ess.&lt;ref&gt;North-China herald, 571&lt;/ref&gt; Miko were once likely seen as a [[Shamanism|shaman]]&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"&gt;Picken, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; role in daily shrine life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from [[sacred]] cleansing&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"/&gt; to performing the sacred [[Kagura]] dance.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
[[File:JP-tokio-meiji-mikos.jpg|thumb|The miko's attire consists of a white haori and a red hakama. The hair is tied in a ponytail with a white and red hair ribbon.]]

The traditional attire of a ''miko'' would be a pair of red [[hakama]] (long, divided trousers) or a long, red, slightly pleated skirt tied with a bow, a white [[haori]] ([[kimono]] jacket), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shintoism, the color white symbolizes purity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Traditional Miko tools include [[azusayumi]] (梓弓 or “catalpa bow”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 76&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tamagushi]] (玉串 or “offertory sakaki-tree branches”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gehōbako]] (外法箱 or the “supernatural box that contains dolls, animal and human skulls ... [and] Shinto prayer beads”).&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The miko also use bells, drums, candles, and bowls of rice in ceremonies.

==Definition==
The Japanese words ''miko'' and ''[[fujo]]'' ("female shaman" and "shrine maiden" respectively&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"&gt;Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary, Revised edition, Shogakukan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;) are usually written 巫女&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; as a compound of the kanji [[wikt:巫#Japanese|巫]] ("shaman"), and [[wikt:女#Japanese|女]] ("woman").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt; ''Miko'' was archaically written [[wikt:神子|神子]] (literally "kami" or "god" + "child")&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and [[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]] ("shaman child").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt;

''Miko'' once performed spirit possession and ''takusen'' as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform [[kagura]] dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a [[Shaman|Geki]], which is a male shaman), the site of a ''takusen'' may occasionally also be attended by a [[sayaniwa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061632/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. [[Kamigakari]] and [[takusen]]&lt;ref name="eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1308 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030134405/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1308 |archivedate=2011-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.&lt;ref name="eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp"/&gt;

Miko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for "shrine-attached Miko"&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and 43 for "non-shrine-attached Miko".&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names are ''[[ichiko]]'' ([[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]], "shaman child", or [[wikt:市子#Japanese|市子]], "market/town child", both likely instances of [[ateji]]) meaning "female medium; fortuneteller",&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and ''[[reibai]]'' ([[wikt:霊媒#Japanese|霊媒]]) meaning "spirit go-between, medium").&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt;

In English, the word is often translated as "[[shrine]] [[maiden]]", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase "[[female]] [[shaman]]" ([[shamanka]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}) or, as [[Lafcadio Hearn]] translated it, "Divineress".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese [[Mikoism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with other Asian terms for female shamans.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women played an important role in a region stretching from Manchuria, China, Korea and Japan to the Ryukyu Islands. In Japan these women were priests, soothsayers, magicians, prophets and shamans in the folk religion, and they were the chief performers in organized Shintoism. These women were called Miko, and the author calls the complex "Mikoism" for lack of a suitable English word.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mikoism==
===History===
Miko traditions date back to the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]]&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"/&gt; of Japan, when female shamans{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who would go into “trances and convey the words of the gods”{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} (the [[kami]]), an act comparable with "the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece."&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest record of anything resembling the term "miko", is of the Chinese reference to [[Himiko]], Japan's earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary), however it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a miko, or even if miko existed in those days.

The early Miko was an important social figure{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who was "associated with the ruling class".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} "In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance", writes Kuly, "[the Miko] performed a variety of religious and political functions".&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"&gt;Kuly, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; One traditional school of Miko, Kuly adds, "claimed to descend from the [[ Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto |Goddess Uzume]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nara period]] (710–794) and [[Heian period]] (794–1185), government officials tried to control Miko practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the feudal [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring ''[[shōgun]]'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling Miko, known as the aruki Miko, became associated with prostitution.&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During in the [[Edo]] period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, "the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations".&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After 1867 the Meiji government's desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor&amp;mdash;the shaman-in-chief of the nation&amp;mdash;meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was an edict called ''Miko Kindanrei'' (巫女禁断令) enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by miko, issued in 1873, by the Religious Affairs Department (教部).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|title=『*%5B%BF%C0%C6%BB %D6%E0%BD%F7%5D』の検索結果 - 耀姫の日記|author=|date=|website=d.hatena.ne.jp|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424204924/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinto [[kagura]] dance ceremony, which originated with "ritual dancing to convey divine oracles",{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called [[Miko-mai]] (巫女舞){{citation needed|date=December 2011}} or [[Miko-kagura]] (巫女神楽).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Traditional training===
[[File:Tokyo, Meiji-jingu (6215281946).jpg|thumb|Miko in [[Meiji Shrine]], Tokyo]]

The position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntary into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential. Several characteristics could be seen as a sign a person was called towards shamanism: neurosis, hallucinations, unusual behavior and hysteria. These conditions are still referred to as ''‘shamanistic sicknesses’''.

To become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the ''kuchiyose miko''.&lt;ref&gt;Ichirō Hōri: ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies''{{issue needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) of a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with ''kami'' and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers. 

Other attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the kami) and swords ([[katana]]). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the kami that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.
After the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which ''kami'' had possessed her and therefore she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hori|first1=Ichiro|title=Folk religion in Japan : continuity and change|date=1968|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226353346|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a beautifully coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.

The resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the kami she served (this is called a ''Tamayori Hime'' 玉依姫). During her trance, said kami had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice (''meshibitsu'') and a pan. An old, since long forsaken, practice was the sexual intercourse with a shintô priest who would represent the kami. As a result of this intercourse, the shaman would have the ''kami’s'' baby (''mikogami'' 御子神 ). 

In some cases the girls or women were visited at night by a travelling spirit (''marebito'' 稀人). After this visit the woman made her new position of being possessed by a ''kami'' known to the rest of her village by placing a white, feathered arrow on the roof of her house.

==Contemporary miko==
[[File:Miko at the Ikuta Shrine.jpg|thumb|Miko at the [[Ikuta Shrine]]]]

Modern miko are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer ''[[omikuji]]'' fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a [[Kannushi]] in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary miko: "A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position."&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnologist [[Kunio Yanagita]] (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into ''jinja miko'' (神社巫女 or "shrine shamans") who dance with bells and participate in ''yudate'' (湯立て or "boiling water") rituals, ''kuchiyose miko'' (口寄せ巫女 or "spirit medium shamans") who speak on behalf of the deceased, and ''kami uba'' (神姥 or "god women") who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the [[Tenrikyo]] founder [[Nakayama Miki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have further categorized contemporary miko in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind ''itako'' (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly blind ''okamin'' (north and east Japan), blind ''waka'' or ''owaka'' (northeastern Japan), ''moriko'' (north and east of Tokyo), ''nono'' (central Japan), blind ''zatokaka'' (northwest Japan), ''sasa hataki'' who tap ''[[Sasa (plant)|sasa]]'' ("bamboo grass") on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 62–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have divided miko or fujo by [[blindness]] between blind ''ogamiya'' (尾上屋 or "invocation specialist") or ''ogamisama'' who perform ''kuchiyose'' and spirit mediumship and sighted miko' or ''kamisama'' who perform divination and invocations.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eclectic [[Shugendō]] religion, male priests who practiced ecstasy often married miko.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild 1962:55.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars identify shamanic miko characteristics in [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] ("New Religions") such as [[Sukyo Mahikari]], [[Ōmoto]], and [[Shinmeiaishinkai]].&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardacre.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''minority religion''' is a [[religion]] held by a [[Minority group|minority]] of the population of a country, state, or region. Minority religions may be subject to [[Social stigma|stigma]] or [[discrimination]]. An example of a stigma is using the term [[cult]] with its extremely negative connotations for certain [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult - by Bryan Wilson {{!}} Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with [[ethnic]] differences.

Laws are made in some countries to protect the rights of religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities' culture and to promote harmony with the majority.

'''''Mirari vos''''' - Latin: I was surprised - (On Liberalism and Religious Indifferentism), sometimes referred to as '''''Mirari vos arbitramur''''', is the first [[Papal Encyclical|encyclical]] of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and was issued in August 1832.  Addressed "To All Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World", it is general in scope.

==Background==
[[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Felicité Robert de Lamennais]], [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]] started a newspaper, ''L'Avenir'' ("The Future"). While the paper was a strong proponent of [[Ultramontanism]], supporting the authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas, it also advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, and universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. They saw no conflict between Catholicism and liberal reform. The conservative French hierarchy regarded such views as dangerous nonsense. In November 1831, Lammennais and Montalembert traveled to [[Rome]], seeking confirmation from Pope Gregory that views expressed in their newspaper were orthodox.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;[https://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/lamann.htm Bernard, Cook. "Lamennais, Hugues-Felicité Robert de (1782-1854)", ''Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions'', (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. [[Klemens von Metternich]], whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-NiMTwLNwx&amp;sig=LFTMJ0M5z-1cTIdbK7NME2T7whg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihvtST-aHJAhXL1B4KHe4BBxQ4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Chadwick, Owen. "Gregory XVI", ''A History of the Popes, 1830-1914'', Oxford University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|9780199262861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope's advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais's opinions. ''Mirari vos'' was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais's views without mentioning him by name.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

==Content== 
He voiced support for Christian freedom, upheld the ecclesiastical supremacy of the papacy and raised concerns over alliances that were too close between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated a married clergy: "We ask that you strive with all your might to justify and to defend the law of clerical celibacy as prescribed by the sacred canons, against which the arrows of the lascivious are directed from every side."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/greg16/g16mirar.htm Pope Gregory XVI, ''Mirari vos'', §11, Rome, August 15, 1832]&lt;/ref&gt; He also denounced those who advocated divorce{{sfn|Mirari vos, §12}} and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

He attacked religious [[indifferentism]], which was defined as the opinion that one religion is as good as another, which he saw as the basis for the argument for liberty of conscience. He saw it as the state's duty to restrain the promotion of false truth, which leads to immorality and so denounced freedom to publish or distribute any writings indiscriminately. Owen Chadwick explains Gregory's perspective: "To provide legally that writers or speakers shall be free to promote what is not true or to utter words that declare that racial prejudice, or paederasty, or pornography, or adultery, or murder not to be sins, cannot be what God demands of any State.{{sfn|Chadwick, p. 25}}

He stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some are so carried away that they contentiously assert that the flock of errors arising from them is sufficiently compensated by the publication of some book which defends religion and truth. Every law condemns deliberately doing evil simply because there is some hope that good may result. Is there any sane man who would say poison ought to be distributed, sold publicly, stored, and even drunk because some antidote is available and those who use it may be snatched from death again and again?{{sfn|Morari vos, §15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor his detractors.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

{{Islam}}

A '''Muslim''' ({{lang-ar|مُسلِم}}) is someone who follows or practices [[Islam]], a [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]]. Muslims consider the [[Quran]], their [[holy book]], to be the verbatim word of [[God in Islam|God]] as revealed to the [[Muhammad in Islam|Islamic]] [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger]] [[Muhammad]]. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (''[[sunnah]]'') as recorded in traditional accounts (''[[hadith]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Qurʼan and Sayings of Prophet Muhammad: Selections Annotated &amp; Explained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzx8HlsGnTcC&amp;pg=PR21|accessdate=31 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing|isbn=978-1-59473-222-5|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Muslim" is an [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] meaning "submitter" (to God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|publisher=etymonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150907223337/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of Muslims include: that God ({{lang-ar|الله}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (''[[tawhid]]''); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]];&lt;ref name="People-of-the-Book"/&gt; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (''[[tahrif]]'')&lt;ref name="Distorted"/&gt; and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (Final Testament).&lt;ref&gt;Submission.org, Quran: The Final Testament, Authorized English Version with Arabic Text, Revised Edition IV,{{ISBN|0-9729209-2-7}}, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifier==
The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]: the declaration of faith (''[[shahadah]]''), daily prayers (''[[salat]]''), fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]] (''[[sawm]]''), almsgiving (''[[zakat]]''), and the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (''[[hajj]]'') at least once in a lifetime.&lt;ref name="WSU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the ''[[Shahada]]'', one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], a [[declaration of faith]] and trust that professes that there is [[tawhid|only one]] [[God in Islam|God]] ''([[Allah]])'' and that [[Muhammad]] is God's messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 From the article on the Pillars of Islam in Oxford Islamic Studies Online] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170426134526/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 |date=26 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh'' ({{lang|ar|لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله}})  "There is no god but Allah, (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vHG_VulBdd4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=convert+islam+shahada#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matthew S.

In [[Sunni Islam]], the shahada has two parts: ''la ilaha illa'llah'' (there is no god but [[Allah|God]]), and ''Muhammadun rasul Allah'' ([[Muhammad]] is the messenger of God),&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Lindsay, p.&amp;nbsp;140–141&lt;/ref&gt; which are sometimes referred to as the first ''shahada'' and the second ''shahada''.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; The first statement of the shahada is also known as the ''[[tahlil|tahlīl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Anthony Sells|title=Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYCFTVDDKmkC|year=1999|publisher=White Cloud Press|page=151|isbn=9781883991265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning [[Ali]], the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia Imam]] and the fourth [[Rashidun|Rashid caliph]] of [[Sunni Islam]]: {{lang|ar|وعليٌ وليُّ الله}} ({{transl|ar|DIN|wa ʿalīyyun walīyyu-llāh}}), which translates to "Ali is the ''[[wali]]'' of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Mughals'' by [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]] p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
{{see also|Islam#Etymology and meaning}}
The word ''muslim'' ({{lang-ar|مسلم}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈmʊslɪm|IPA}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|m|ʌ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|s|l|ᵻ|m}} or ''moslem'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|z|l|ə|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|s|l|ə|m}}&lt;ref name="muslim pron" /&gt;) is the [[active participle]] of the same verb of which ''islām'' is a [[verbal noun]], based on the [[triliteral]] ''[[S-L-M]]'' "to be whole, intact".&lt;ref&gt;Burns &amp; Ralph, ''World Civilizations'', 5th ed., p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''šlm'', p. 2067, Appendix B: Semitic Roots, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th ed., Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2000, {{ISBN|0-618-08230-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A female adherent is a ''muslima'' ({{lang-ar|مسلمة}}) (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Muslimah"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah Muslimah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817020605/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah |date=17 August 2016 }}. ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ). The plural form in Arabic is ''muslimūn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمون}}) or ''muslimīn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمين}}), and its feminine equivalent is ''muslimāt'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمات}}). The Arabic form ''muslimun'' is the stem IV [[Arabic grammar#Participle|participle]]{{refn|group=note|name=participle|also known as "infinitive"}} of the triliteral ''S-L-M''.

The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". It is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Moslem", which is an older spelling.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The word ''Mosalman'' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}, alternatively ''Mussalman'') is a common equivalent for ''Muslim'' used in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term ''[[Mohammedan]]s'' or ''Mahometans''.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the second edition of ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage|A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' by [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]], revised by [[Ernest Gowers]] (Oxford, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be [[pejorative]], Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Gibb| first = Sir Hamilton| title = Mohammedanism: an historical survey| year = 1969| page=1 | quote=Modern Muslims dislike the terms Mohammedan and Mohammedanism, which seem to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsolete terms include ''Muslimite''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Muslimite}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Muslimist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Tahir|title=Muslim Britain: Communities Under Pressure|date=2005|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musulmán'''/'''Mosalmán''' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}) is a synonym for ''Muslim'' and is modified from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It is the origin of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''{{lang|es|musulmán}}'', the (dated) [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Muselmann}}'', the French word ''musulman'', the [[Polish language|Polish]] words ''{{lang|pl|muzułmanin}}'' and ''{{lang|pl|muzułmański}}'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''{{lang|pt|muçulmano}}'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''{{lang|it|mussulmano}}'' or ''{{lang|it|musulmano}}'', the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''musulman'' and the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|μουσουλμάνος}} (all used for a Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm Musalman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104031529/http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm |date=4 January 2007 }} – Internet Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt; In English it was sometimes spelled '''Mussulman''' and has become [[Archaism|archaic]] in usage.

Apart from Persian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, and Greek, the term could be found, with obvious local differences, in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Panjabi language|Panjabi]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

==Meaning==
The Muslim philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] said:

{{Quote|A Muslim is a person who has dedicated his worship exclusively to God...''Islam'' means making one's religion and faith God's alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Qur'an'', Razi, I, p. 432, Cairo, 1318/1900&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other prophets===
The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Jacob]], [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], and [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] and his [[apostles]] are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (''wa-shahad be anna muslimūn'')." In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the [[Tawrat]] ([[Torah]]) to Moses, the [[Zabur]] ([[Psalms]]) to [[David]] and the [[Injil]] ([[Gospel]]) to Jesus, who are all considered important [[Prophets of Islam|Muslim prophets]].

{{God}}
'''National gods''' are a class of guardian divinities or [[deities]] whose special concern is the safety and well-being of an ethnic group (''[[nation]]''), and of that group's leaders. This is contrasted with other guardian figures such as family gods responsible for the well-being of individual clans or professions, or personal gods who are responsible for the well-being of individuals. These guardian roles augment the functions that a divinity might otherwise have (wisdom, health, war, and so on).

==National gods==
In antiquity (and to some extent continuing today), religion was a characteristic of regional culture, together with language, customs, traditions, etc. Many of these ethnic religions included national god(s) in their pantheons, such as &lt;!-- in alphabetical order --&gt;

==In antiquity==
In antiquity, each ethnic group (''[[nation]]'') had its own pantheon, which may or may not have [[Religious syncretism|overlapped]] with that of neighbouring groups. Many of these religions had guardian figures, which then sometimes included national gods, who were considered responsible for the safety and well-being of the nation and of its people, with a special concern for the nation's ruler and guardian. These national gods stood alongside the personal gods, that is, the patron gods who took a special interest in an individual's personal well-being. Additionally, there were the family gods associated with the care of a clan or profession, as well as gods associated with specific situations or the protection thereof (fertility, health, war, contracts and so on).

This perception of divinity was common in the ancient world. Deities were often geographically localized by association to their main cult centers, and in the Ancient Near East were often [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of their respective [[cities of the Ancient Near East|city-states]]. Many of the individual ethnic groups also considered itself the progeny of its national gods. For example, in the region that is now Yemen, the [[Sabaeans]], the [[Minaeans]] and the [[Himyar]] each perceived themselves to be the children of respectively [[Almaqah]], [[Wadd]] and [[Shamash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Doniger|editor-first=Wendy|chapter=Arabian religions|title=Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of World Religions|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]], [[Milcom]] held that role for the [[Ammon|Ammonites]], while [[Chemosh]] did so for the [[Moab]].

[[Yahweh]]'s role as the national god of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judaeans]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samarians]] is a key reason for that figure's adoption as the [[monism|monist]] figure by the [[Deuteronomic reform|Yahweh-only movement]] of the 7th-century BC. Yahweh's subsequent exaltation as a supreme figure occurred not because national gods were necessarily heads of their pantheons (this was certainly not the case for the national gods of the peoples surrounding Israel),&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt; but as a reaction to the changing political landscape, in which other national gods had previously become exalted in that fashion.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; Because peoples were perceived to effectively worship the same gods, merely by different names (Smith (2008)&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; terms this "translatability"), Yahweh's function as a national god had previously automatically equated him with other national gods. Thus, with the rise of the multi-cultural [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] in the 10th century BC, the concomitant rise of the Assyrian's nation god Assur to inter-cultural prominence influenced how national gods were generally perceived. Moreover, the political unification of the fractured nation-states under a single supreme head of state encouraged the idea of a multi-national "one-god" worldview as well.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008" /&gt; By the 7th-century BC however, Assyria was in decline and the smaller nation-states began to reassert their independence. In this context, the development of a "one-god" worldview in 7th century BC [[Kingdom of Judah]] can be perceived as a response to the diminishing claims to cultural hegemony of the Assyrian "one-god" ideology of the time.&lt;ref name="Smith_2008"&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=God in Translation: Deities in Cross-cultural Discourse in the Biblical World|series=Forschungen zum Alten Testament, vol. 57|location=Tübingen|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=978-3-16-149543-4|page=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process is evident in some parts of the [[Torah]] which predate the 6th century BC and thus preserve vestiges of the theology centered on a national god during the 10th-century BC [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchic period]].&lt;ref name="Smith_2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-516768-9|pages=155–163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The OT {{bracket|{{=}}[[Old Testament]]}} is still conscious of the fact that Yhwh, the national god of Israel, originally was one of the gods in the council of El." (''Deut'' 32:8-9*)&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;{{citation|editor-last=van der Toorn|editor-first=K.|editor2-last=Becking|editor2-first=Bob|editor3-last=van der Horst|editor3-first=Pieter Willem|chapter=King|title=Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible|year=1999|isbn=978-90-04-11119-6|page=485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern period==
[[Christian missionaries]] have repeatedly re-interpreted national gods in terms of the Christian God. This fact is reflected in the [[names of God]] in various languages of Christianized peoples, such as [[Shangdi]] or [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]] among Chinese Christians, [[Ngai]] among a number of tribes of [[Kenya]], [[Bathala|Bathalang Maykapal]] for the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] in the Philippines, etc.

In a modern context, the term of a "national god" addresses the emergence of [[national church]]es within Christianity. This tendency was of "nationalizing" the Christian God, especially in the context of national churches sanctioning warfare against other Christian nations during [[World War I]], was denounced as heretical by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Ethnics'', ed. Braun, transl. Bromiley, New York, 1981, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] in his essay ''Wotan'' (1936) identifies the Germanic god of the storm (leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]), [[Wōden|Wotan]], as the national god of the [[German people]], and warns of the rise of [[German nationalism]] and ultimately the then-impending catastrophe of [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]] in terms of the re-awakening of this god:
:"But what is more than curious &amp;mdash; indeed, piquant to a degree &amp;mdash; is that an ancient god of storm and frenzy, the long quiescent Wotan, should awake, like an extinct volcano, to new activity, in a civilized country that had long been supposed to have outgrown the Middle Ages. [...] I venture the heretical suggestion that the unfathomable depths of Wotan's character explain more of National Socialism than all three reasonable factors [viz. economic, political, and psychological] put together. [...] This is a tragic experience and no disgrace. It has always been terrible to fall into the hands of a living god. [[Yahweh]] was no exception to this rule, and the Philistines, Edomites, Amorites and the rest, who were outside the Yahweh experience, must certainly have found it [[Biblical Canaanites|exceedingly disagreeable]]. The [[Arabs|Semitic]] experience of [[God in Islam|Allah]] was for a long time an extremely [[Islamic conquests|painful affair]] for the whole of Christendom. We who stand outside judge the Germans far too much, as if they were responsible agents, but perhaps it would be nearer the truth to regard them, also, as victims."&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (Zurich)  (March, 1936), 657-69. Republished in ''Aufsätze zur Zeitgeschichte'' (Zurich, 1946), 1-23. English translation by Barbara Hannah, ''Essays on Contemporary Events'' (London, 1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; It is named after the idea that modern [[pizza]] toppings were developed among [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] [[History of immigration to the United States|in the United States]] (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [[Italian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dandavats"/&gt;

Related phrases include "hermeneutical feedback loop", "re-enculturation", and "self-orientalization". The term "pizza effect" was coined by the Austrian-born [[Hindu]] [[Dashanami Sampradaya|monk]] and professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]], [[Agehananda Bharati]]&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=knott/&gt;&lt;ref name="dandavats"&gt;[[Steven J.

== Examples ==
The original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:
*The [[Apu trilogy]] films of [[Satyajit Ray]], which were flops in India before they were given prizes in [[Western countries]] and re-evaluated as classics of the [[Indian cinema]]&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;

The [[Day of the Dead]] parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', which was fictional at the time of the film's production. &lt;ref&gt;David Agren, October 30, 2016, The Gaurdian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city Mexico City's James Bond-inspired Day of the Dead parade gets mixed reviews], retrieved October 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

[[Haoqiu zhuan]], a Chinese novel.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English "gave life and fame" to ''Haoqiu zhuan'' and therefore affected its standing in China.&lt;ref name="StAndrep39" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

{{Prayer}}
'''Prayer''' is an [[invocation]] or act that seeks to activate a [[rapport]] with an object of [[worship]], typically a [[deity]],  through deliberate [[communication]]. In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of [[supplication]] or [[intercession]] directed towards a [[deity]], or a deified [[ancestor worship|ancestor]]. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of [[thanksgiving]] or [[praise]], and in [[comparative religion]] is closely associated with more abstract forms of [[meditation]] and with [[Incantation|charms or spells]].&lt;ref&gt;F.B. Jevons, '''An Introduction to the Study of Comparative Religion'' (1908), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HgddDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73  p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set [[liturgy]] or [[ritual]], and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a [[hymn]], [[incantation]], formal [[creed]]al statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.

Today, most major [[religion]]s involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time.

==Etymology==
The English term ''prayer'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''precaria'' "petition, prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=pray (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pray|website=etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=30 December 2014}}
Via Old French ''prier'', nominalised use of the Latin adjective ''precaria'' "something obtained by entreating, something given as a favour", from ''precari'' "to ask for, entreat".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vulgate]] Latin is ''[[:wikt:oratio|oratio]]'', which translates Greek [[:wikt:προσευχή|προσευχή]]&lt;ref&gt;Biblical synonyms or alternatives for προσευχή: εὐχή, δέησις, ἔντευξις, εὐχαριστία, αἴτημα, ἱκετηρία. Richard C. Trench, Synonyms of the New Testament, s.v. [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/trench/section.cfm?sectionID=51 εὐχή].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn the  [[Septuagint]] translation  of [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|[[:wikt:תפילה|תְּפִלָּה]]}} ''tĕphillah''.&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8605&amp;t=KJV H8605].&lt;/ref&gt;

Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, [[Grace (prayer)|graces said over meals]], and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] regard dancing as a form of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Littlebird |first= Sarracina|title= Sacred Movement: Dance as Prayer in the Pueblo Cultures of the American Southwest |publisher= Barnard College Department of Dance |year= 2008 |url= http://dance.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/sarracina_littlebird.pdf |accessdate= 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Sufism|Sufis]] [[Sufi whirling|whirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi – Sufism and Dervishes |url= http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |work= WhirlingDervishes.org |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195830/http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm |archivedate= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindus chant mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Omkarananda |first= Swami |title= How to Pray |publisher= Omkarananda Ashram Himalayas |date= n.d.  |url= http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104195625/http://www.omkarananda-ashram.org/Publications/how_to_pray.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish prayer may involve [[Shuckling|swaying]] back and forth and bowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Judaism: Jewish Rituals and Practices – Jewish Worship and Prayer |work= ReligionFacts.com |publisher= ReligionFacts |author= Anonymous |date= 2013-07-03 |url= http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104200647/http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}.

Still others combine the two.

[[Friedrich Heiler]] is often cited in Christian circles for his systematic ''Typology of Prayer'' which lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erickson, Millard J.|title=Christian theology|publisher=Baker Book House|location=Grand Rapids|year=1998|isbn=0-8010-2182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification such as in [[ghusl]] and [[wudhu]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopedia of Islam - Page 20, Cyril Glassé - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily "thought life", in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations,&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{Catholic |last= Wynne |first= John |volume= 12 |title= Prayer |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.
Some outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||James|5:14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ringing a bell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheckel|first=Roger J.|title=The Angelus| publisher = The Marian Catechists|date=January 2004|url= http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623093915/http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; burning incense or paper;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Art|publisher=Pacific Asia Museum|year=2003|url=http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/buddhism/html/essay4.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704073342/http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/buddhism/html/essay4.htm|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting a candle or candles; See, for example, facing a specific direction (i.e. towards [[Mecca]]&lt;ref name=Emerick&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerick|first=Yahiya| authorlink=Yahiya Emerick|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam|publisher=Alpha Books|year=2002|location= Indianapolis IN|pages=127–28|url=http://www.idiotsguides.com|isbn=0-02-864233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the East); making the [[sign of the cross]]. One less noticeable act related to prayer is [[fasting]].

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Origins and early history==

[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|thumb|A kneeling position with raised hands expressed "supplication" in classical antiquity. The word for "prayer" and for "supplication" is identical in ancient languages (''oratio'', προσευχή,  תְּפִלָּה etc.), with no terminological distinction between supplications addressed to human as opposed to divine powers.
Statuette known as "Praying German" or "supplicating barbarian". It is not known if this figure was originally set in a context of religious prayer or of military surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Image from [https://archive.org/details/artscraftsofourt00brow "The arts and crafts of our Teutonic forefathers"] by G. B. Brown (1910), where it is glossed as "Bronze figure of a German, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris". "the existence of other bronze barbarians in similar attitudes of prayer and subjection suggests that the composition was a popular one" (Melissa Barden Dowling, Clemency and cruelty in the Roman world, 2006, p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Anthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of [[Submission|surrender]] and [[supplication]]. 
The traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in Corinthians 11:4, in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the "flight" posture, a crouching posture with raised hands, observed in schizophrenic patients and related to the universal [[list of gestures|"hands up" gesture]] of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Claire; Russell, W.M.S. (1989). "Cultural Evolution of Behaviour". Netherlands Journal of Zoology. 40 (4): 745–762 (756f.). doi:10.1163/156854290X00190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in [[animism]], communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a [[shaman]] who, through a [[trance]], gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using [[astrology]] or contemplating [[Fortune telling|fortune tellers]] and healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|publisher=OMF|title=Animism Profile in Cambodia|accessdate=2008-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124231/http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the oldest extant literature, such as the Sumerian temple hymns of [[Enheduanna]] (c. 23th century BC) are liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically "prayer". The Egyptian [[Pyramid Texts]] of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of [[magical thinking]] combined with [[animism]], prayer has been argued as representing a [[human cultural universal]], which would have been present since the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]], by [[anthropology|anthropologists]]  such as Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and Sir [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Zaleski, Carol |author2=Zaleski, Philip |title=Prayer: A History|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|year=2006|pages=24–25|isbn=0-618-77360-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliable records are available for the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions of the [[Iron Age]], most notably [[Ancient Greek religion]] (which strongly influenced [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]). These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier [[Prehistoric religion#Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age religions]].
Ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayor|first=Diane|title=The Homeric Hymns| publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9232/9232.intro.php| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religio Romana|publisher=Nova Roma|url=http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/posture.html|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient polytheism, [[ancestor worship]] is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also [[Euhemerism]]).
Vestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese [[Shinto]] and in [[Chinese ancestor worship|Chinese folk religion]]. The practices involved in [[Shinto]] prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; [[Japanese Buddhism]] has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn.  Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the ''[[kami]]'', rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of [[votive offering]] is also universal, and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an ''[[ema (Shintō)|ema]]''.

Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language. The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic de Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'': "I give, so that you may give." [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s Mars Prayer, found in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' (141), English translation at: {{citation |url= http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |contribution= Cato's Mars Prayer |title= Indo-European Texts: Old Latin |editor1= Jonathan Slocum |editor2= Carol Justus |date= 13 May 2014 |publisher= [[Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903231425/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html |archivedate= 3 September 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''; Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]
[[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] and [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]] religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. They nevertheless show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in [[skaldic poetry]]. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', compiled in the 13th century ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' from earlier traditional sources, where the [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] prays to the gods and the [[Jörð|earth]] after being woken by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe25.htm|title=The Poetic Edda: Sigrdrifumol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A prayer to [[Odin]] is mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' where King [[Rerir]] prays for a child.   In stanza 9 of the poem ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', a prayer is made to "kind [[Vættir|wights]], Frigg and [[Freyja]], and many gods&lt;ref&gt;"although since the poem is often considered one of the youngest poems in the Poetic Edda, the passage has been the matter of some debate." [[Stephan Grundy|Grundy, Stephan]] (1998). "Freyja and Frigg" as collected in Billington, Sandra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Concept of the Goddess]'', p. 60.

[[Folk religion]] in the medieval period produced [[syncretism]]s between pre-Christian and Christian traditions.

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], prayers to the "Great Wit" are performed by the "clever men" and "clever women", or ''kadji''. These [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] shamans use [[maban]] or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkin|first=Adolphus P.|title=Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition|publisher=Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company|year=1973|isbn=0-89281-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] Indians are known to have used [[prayer stick]]s, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The [[Hopi]] Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prayer stick|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to prayer==
{{bias|bias=Judeo-Christian views and religions|date=May 2018}}

===Direct petitions===
The most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one's requests.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheist]] arguments against prayer are mostly directed against [[Supplication|petitionary prayer]] in particular. [[Daniel Dennett]] argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.&lt;ref&gt;"Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm not at all sure about that. For one thing, if they ''really'' wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about" {{cite book |first= Daniel C. |last= Dennett |authorlink= Daniel Dennett |contribution= Thank Goodness |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever |editor-last= Hitchens |editor-first= Christopher |editor-link= Christopher Hitchens |year= 2007 |publisher= Da Capo Press |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9780306816086 |oclc= 156811900 |page= }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as [[Christian Scientists]] who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |title= In Child Deaths, a Test for Christian Science |first= David |last= Margolick |date= 6 August 1990 |newspaper= The New York Times |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104202219/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/us/in-child-deaths-a-test-for-christian-science.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s definition of prayer by stating that "the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right."&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2012 n.p"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Mortality (book)|Mortality]] |last= Hitchens |first= Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |year= 2012 |publisher= Twelve |place= New York |isbn= 9781455502752 |oclc= 776526158 |page= }}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] [[Siddur]] (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII).

Among Christian theologians, [[Edward McKendree Bounds|E.M. Bounds]] stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, ''The Necessity of Prayer''. Prayer books such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bounds|first=Edward McKendree|title=The Necessity of Prayer|publisher=AGES Software|year=1907|isbn=0-8010-0659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalist approach===
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation ([[meditation]]). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] &lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Perplexed 3:51&lt;/ref&gt; and the other medieval rationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Ha'Ikarim 4:18&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===Experiential approach===
[[File:Theophile Lybaert - Old Flanders.jpeg|thumb|''Old woman praying'' by [[Théophile Lybaert]]]]
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.  Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of [[Lectio Divina]], historically a [[Benedictine]] practice in which scripture is read aloud; actively meditated upon using the intellect (but not analysis) possibly using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text that was read; a prayer spoken; and finally concludes with [[Lectio Divina#Contemplatio: contemplate|contemplation]], a more passive experiential approach than the previous meditation, which is characterized by the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] as an experience of consciously being attentive, and having a silent love toward God, which the individual experiences without demanding to receive an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Expressions of prayer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of God within [[Apophatic theology|Christian mysticism]] has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or [[Religious experience|mystical experience]] because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as "experiential", as well as without the phenomena of experience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian Mysticism'' by Denys Turner 1998 Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521645611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used a term called "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{Citation not found}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Science and Religion, [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;— during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;— famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116-119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{Citation not found}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action.

===Hebrew Bible===
{{Main|Prayer in the Hebrew Bible}}
In the Hebrew Bible prayer is an evolving means of interacting with [[God]], most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in [[Deuteronomy]], the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the [[Tefillah|form practiced]] by modern [[Jews]].

Individual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with [[Isaac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2025:21&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 25: 21 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011:2&amp;version=NIV |title=Num. 11:2 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+8:6&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Samuel 8:6 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+42:10&amp;version=NIV |title=Job. 42:10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] to [[Hezekiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Prayer," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=496&amp;letter=P&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
{{Main|Prayer in the New Testament}}
In the New Testament prayer is presented as a positive command ({{bibleverse||Colossians|4:2}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17}}). The [[People of God]] are challenged to include [[Christian prayer]] in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5}}) as it brings people closer to [[God in Christianity|God]].

[[Jesus]] encouraged his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the [[Lord's Prayer]], as a humble response to the prayer of the [[Pharisees]], whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers ({{bibleverse||Matthew|6:6}}).

Throughout the [[New Testament]], prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow ({{bibleverse||Matthew|7:7-11}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:24-29}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|11:13}}. Further, the [[Book of James]] says that the lack of [[blessing]]s in life results from a failure to pray ({{bibleverse||James|4:2}}). Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:17-18}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish prayer}}
[[File:Jewish Canadian soldiers during WWII.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Captain Samuel Cass, a [[rabbi]], conducting the first prayer service celebrated on German territory by Jewish personnel of the [[First Canadian Army]] near [[Kleve|Cleve]], Germany, 18 March 1945]]
Observant Jews pray three times a day, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]] including [[Musaf]] and the reading of the [[Torah]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''[[kavanah]]'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] ("Hear O Israel") and the [[Amidah]] ("the standing prayer").

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a ''[[minyan]]'') is considered by [[Orthodox Judaism]] a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
[[File:Muro de las Lamentaciones, Jerusalén, Israel, 2017.gif|thumb|[[Orthodox Jewish]] men praying in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]]]]

There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach====
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word "prayer" is a derivative of the Latin "precari", which means "to beg". The Hebrew equivalent "tefilah", however, along with its root "pelel" or its reflexive "l’hitpallel", means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ou.org/torah/article/why_tefilah_doesn |title= Why Tefilah Doesn't Mean Prayer: Redefining our Relationship with G-d |first= Steven |last= Weil |authorlink= Steven Weil |date= September 14, 2010 |type= video presentation |work= ou.org |publisher= [[Orthodox Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/862508/jewish/Talking-With-Gd.htm |first= Naftali |last= Silberberg |date= n.d. |title= Jewish Practice " Mitzvahs &amp; Traditions " Prayer " Insights – Talking With G‑d |work= [[Chabad.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational approach====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach====
[[Kabbalah]] uses a series of ''[[Kavanah|kavanot]]'', directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114937/jewish/The-Kabbalah.htm The Kabbalah of Prayer] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]], and [[Jacob Emden]].

Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9–13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;''Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition'' by Anne Geldart 1999 {{ISBN|0-435-30324-4}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt; In medieval England, prayers (particularly the ''[[Lord's Prayer|paternoster]]'') were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.&lt;ref&gt;Irma Taavitsainen, 'Middle English Recipes: Genre Characteristics, Text Type Features and Underlying Traditions of Writing', ''Journal of Historical Pragmatics'', 2 (2001), 85–113 (p. 103), DOI: 10.1075/jhp.2.1.05taa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) will also ask the righteous in heaven and "in Christ," such as [[Virgin Mary]] or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf ([[intercession of saints]]). Formulaic closures include "through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages," and "in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

It is customary among Protestants to end prayers with "In [[Jesus]]' name, Amen" or "In the name of [[Christ]], Amen."&lt;ref&gt;See John 16:23, 26; John 14:13; John 15:16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply "[[Amen]]" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as ''so be it'').

In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]]; In the Eastern Church (the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the [[Christian meditation|meditative]] [[hesychasm]] practice in [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' {{ISBN|0-631-23203-6}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as [[acts of reparation]] which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]] performed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic |last= Slater |first= Thomas |volume= 12 |title= Reparation |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm |no-icon= 1 |prescript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of prayer among Catholics would be meditative prayer, contemplative prayer and infused prayer discussed at length by Catholic Saints St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Jesus.

====Pentecostalism====
In [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Library - Religion – Christianity - Pentecostalism |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Company |url= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104194445/http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:1-13|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|10:45-47|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. [[George Barton Cutten]] suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;George Barton Cutten, ''Speaking with Tongues Historically and Psychologically Considered'', Yale University Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicitas Goodman]] suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Felicitas D., ''Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia''. University of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.' ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 8, 2: (1969) 211–26: quote on p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samarin, William J., ''Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism''. Macmillan, New York, 1972, quote on p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.'

''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'': 1979 Aug Vol 88(4) 427–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy]], "Prayer," in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston, Trustees Under the Will of Mary Baker Eddy, 1934 [etc.]pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists do not practice [[intercessory prayer]] as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Christian Science Q&amp;A|title=Is there no intercessory prayer?|url=http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|accessdate=2007-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/19990830121655/http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|archivedate=1999-08-30|df=}}

===Islam===
{{Main|Salat|Dua}}
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Muslims in prostration in [[Syria]] (2003 photograph).]]
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for prayer is ''[[salah]]''. In Islam, there are five daily obligatory prayers that are considered as one of the pillars of the religion. The command to ritual prayer occurs repeatedly in the [[Quran]]. The prayer is performed by the person while they are facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. There is the "call for prayer" (''[[adhan]]''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning ‘Allāhu Akbar’ (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (''[[Al-Fatiha]]'')), [[Ruku|bowing down]] then praising God, [[prostration|prostrating]] (''[[sujud]]'') then again praising God and it ends with the words: "Peace be with you and God’s mercy". During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs that are known as ''[[dua]]''. There are many standard invocations in [[Arabic]] to be recited at various times (''e.g.'' after the prayer) and for various occasions (''e.g.'' for one's parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.&lt;ref name="Emerick" /&gt; Certain [[Shi'a]] sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UlaBw3MUGBEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=shia+pray+3+times&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urkrTeT9MM6IhQeAwrydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Muslim cultures today: a reference guide] By Kathryn M.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main|Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Báb]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayers]] composed by Bahá'u'lláh. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bahá'ís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=P.|year=1999|title =A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, UK|pages=274–75|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern religions==
{{see|Eastern religions|Meditation|Mantra}}
In both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the repetition of [[mantra]]s is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion ([[rosary]], [[Jesus prayer]]). Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. [[Gayatri Mantra]] dedicated to [[Savitr]], [[Pavamana Mantra]] to [[Soma (drink)|Soma Pavamana]], and many of the Buddhist [[Dhāraṇī]] originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or ''[[bodhisattva]]'', such as ''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' being in origin the invocation of a ''bodhisattva'' called ''Maṇipadma''. However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical [[sound symbolism]]. The most extreme example of this is the [[om]] syllable, which as early as in the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] was claimed as equivalent to the entire [[Vedas]] (collection of ritual hymns).&lt;ref&gt;Aitareya Brahmana 5.32, Arthur Berriedale Keith, ''The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda''. Harvard University Press, 1920, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|thumb|Buddhists praying with incense at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], Thailand]]
In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[Chán]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Selfless Persons|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1982|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=6|isbn=0-521-39726-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=June 2018}}

The [[Upāya|skillful means]] (Sanskrit: ''upāya'') of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: ''[[pariṇāmanā]]'') is an [[evocation]] and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: ''buddha-kshetra'').

The ''[[Trikaya|nirmānakāya]]'' of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a [[mandala]]. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: ''maṇḍala'') is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is not just cultivated but ''is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=Bhikshu|title=A Survey of Buddhism|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|location=Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom|pages=449–60|isbn=0-904766-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common prayer is "May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss." (願以此功德 莊嚴佛淨土 上報四重恩 下濟三途苦 普願諸眾生 冤親諸債主 悉發菩提心 同生極樂國)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sutrasmantras.info/prayers.html|title=Buddhist Prayers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Generation Stage]] (Sanskrit: ''utpatti-krama'') of [[Vajrayana]] involves prayer elements.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.100. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Buddhism]] tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as [[guru yoga]] which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or ''[[yidam]]'' are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: ''santana''; refer [[mindstream]]) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage ''yidam'' or [[tutelary deities]] will depend upon the level or more appropriately ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yana]]'' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is ''[[śūnyatā]]''. The views of the more esoteric ''yana'' are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like [[mantra]]s, a practice often called ''[[Nembutsu]]''.&lt;ref name=smithnovak03&gt;"The Flowering of Faith: Buddhism's Pure Land Tradition" (pp. 185–98) in {{cite book

According to [[Shinran]], the founder of the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] tradition that is most prevalent in the US,&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Novak (2003) state that "Pure Land Buddhism has entered America almost exclusively from Japan, and the church Shinran founded is the largest Pure Land presence on this continent" (p. 193).&lt;/ref&gt; "for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu."&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref&gt;This quotation is Smith and Novak's paraphrase of Shinran's teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Prayer in Hinduism}}
[[File:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|[[Shaktism|Shakta]] Hindus in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, pray to the goddess during ''[[Durga Puja]]'', October 2003]]
[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''prārthanā''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, ''dhyanam'' involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as ''devtas'', trinity or incarnation of either ''devtas'' or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]]{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}. Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], a preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in ''[[pranam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5732hIV03kC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Stephen Jacobs (2010), ''Hinduism Today : An Introduction'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Sikhism===
[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|A [[Sikh]] holy man, doing Sikh prayer ([[Ardās]])]]
The ''[[Ardās]]'' (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a [[Sikh]] prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily ''[[Banis]]'' (prayers); or completion of a service like the ''[[Paath]]'' (scripture reading/recitation), ''[[kirtan]]'' (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The ''Ardas'' is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the ''Ardas'' is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like "[[Waheguru]] please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake" when starting a new task or "[[Akal Purakh]], having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times", etc. The word "Ardās" is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

Ardās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |title= Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060806235347/http://www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp |archivedate= 2006-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://new.sgpc.net/ardas/# |title= Learn and recite the Holy Ardas |work= sgpc.net |publisher= [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New religious movements==
[[Wicca]]n prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Prayers are seen as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. This may include prayers for ''[[esbat]]'' and ''[[sabbat]]'' celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for your own or others safety, for healing or for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiccan Prayer Book: Daily, Mark Ventimiglia - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Raëlism]] rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies, to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies are performed on certain special days on the Raelian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan J., Aliens Adored. Rutgers University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Raël, Sensual Meditation. Tagman Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eckankar]], one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word "HU" which is pronounced as "hue", a holy name of God. This can be done with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Eckankar: Ancient Wisdom for Today - Page 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of [[Theurgy#Esoteric Christianity|Theurgy]] and [[Western esotericism]] may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers "from the heart" that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to [[Hermetic Qabalah]], and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the [[Inner God]], or another spiritual being, and the "prayer from the heart" to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.

[[Image:Stelae of Ankh-af-na-khonsu (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|Many Thelemites recite "Resh" (Liber Resh vel Helios, or "Liber CC") facing the direction of the ever-present sun as it rises in the East, triumphs in the South, sets in the West, and "hides" in the North. Photo shows a close-up of the [[Stele of Revealing]].]]
In [[Thelema]] (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]; rituals of one's own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of 4 hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different godforms identified with the sun).&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo. The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema, p. 12. Weiser, 2003. {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no dogma within Thelema that expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform "Resh", it may be noted that the practice of "Resh" is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of "worshiping" the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as uses mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so "that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to 'look at things from the point of view of the Sun'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erwinhessle.com/writings/pvsun.php|title=The Point of View of the Sun|first=Erwin|last=Hessle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prayer healing==
{{main|Faith healing}}
Prayer is often used as a means of [[faith healing]] in an attempt to use [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] means to prevent illness, cure [[disease]], or improve health. 

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernable effect" while a 2007 systemic review of [[studies on intercessory prayer]] reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pell-adamant-prayer-cures-cancer-20091221-l8fy.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Pell adamant prayer cures cancer|date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden "miracle cure", and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
{{main|Efficacy of prayer}}
[[File:Laying on of hands.jpg|thumb|To pray over an individual while [[laying on of hands|laying hands on them]] is a form of faith healing in Christianity.]]
In 1872, [[Francis Galton]] conducted a famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.&lt;ref name="Galton"/&gt; While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of [[Confounding variable|confounders]], it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |author= Anonymous |date= July 20, 2005 |title= Skeptico – Prayer still useless |work= skeptico.blogs.com |type= blog |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104203127/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html |archive-date= 2014-11-04 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.&lt;ref name="SouthMedJ"/&gt; Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study.&lt;ref name="Infidels"/&gt; Another such study was reported by Harris et al.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began,&lt;ref&gt;Tessman I and Tessman J "Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims," Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leibovici | first1 = L | year = 2001 | title = Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 323 | issue = 7327| pages = 1450–1 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1450 | pmid = 11751349 | pmc=61047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.&lt;ref name="O'Laoire"/&gt; A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aviles | first1 = JM | last2 = Whelan | first2 = SE | last3 = Hernke | first3 = DA | last4 = Williams | first4 = BA | last5 = Kenny | first5 = KE | last6 = O'Fallon | first6 = WM | last7 = Kopecky | first7 = SL | year = 2001 | title = Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 76 | issue = 12| pages = 1192–8 | doi = 10.4065/76.12.1192 | pmid = 11761499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krucoff | first1 = MW | last2 = Crater | first2 = SW | last3 = Gallup | first3 = D | last4 = Blankenship | first4 = JC | last5 = Cuffe | first5 = M | last6 = Guarneri | first6 = M | last7 = Krieger | first7 = RA | last8 = Kshettry | first8 = VR | last9 = Morris | first9 = K | last10 = Oz | first10 = M | last11 = Pichard | first11 = A | last12 = Sketch | first12 = MH Jr | last13 = Koenig | first13 = HG | last14 = Mark | first14 = D | last15 = Lee | first15 = KL | year = 2005 | title = Music, imagery, touch, and prayer as adjuncts to interventional cardiac care: the Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings (MANTRA) II randomised study | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9481| pages = 211–7 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66910-3 | pmid = 16023511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another similar study published in the ''[[American Heart Journal]]'' in 2006,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="Saletan 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STEP 2006" /&gt; Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of [[cardiac bypass]] patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt;

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201075605/http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=%2FAtoz%2Fdc%2Fcen%2Fcanc%2Fgen%2Fmindspirit.html |date=2009-02-01 }}. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref name="STEP 2006"/&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient’s age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through [[neuroscience]]. Leaders in this movement include [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]], an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  In Newberg's brain scans, monks,  priests, nuns, [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites.  This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain’s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume{{page needed|date=September 2010}} the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009).  For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg, Andrew.

===Prevalence of prayer for health===
Some modalities of [[alternative medicine]] employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018194658/http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm |archivedate=2004-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">'''Religion and geography''' is the study of the impact of [[geography]], i.e. place and space, on [[religious belief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Routledge Companion to the Study of  Religion|editor=Hinnells, J|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|chapter=Religion and geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the relationship between religion and geography is ''religious geography'', in which geographical ideas are influenced by religion, such as early map-making, and the ''biblical geography'' that developed in the 16th century to identify [[List of Biblical places|places from the Bible]].&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=1990|title=Geography and religion: trends and prospects|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=14|issue=3|pages=355–371|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/14/3/355|doi=10.1177/030913259001400302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research traditions==
Traditionally, the relationship between geography and religion can clearly be seen by the influences of religion in shaping cosmological understandings of the world. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the study of geography and religion mainly focused on mapping the spread of Christianity (termed ecclesiastical geography by Issac 1965), though in the later half of the seventeenth century, the influences and spread of other religions were also taken into account.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Other traditional approaches to the study of the relationship between geography and religion involved the theological explorations of the workings of Nature – a highly environmentally deterministic approach which identified the role of geographical environments in determining the nature and evolution of different religious traditions.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Thus, geographers are less concerned about religion per se, but are more sensitive to how religion as a cultural feature affects social, cultural, political and environmental systems. The point of focus is not the specifics of religious beliefs and practices, but how these religious beliefs and practices are internalised by adherents, and how these processes of internalization influence, and is influenced by, social systems.

==Sacred places==
Traditional cultural geographical approaches to the study of religion mainly seek to determine religion’s impact on the landscape. A more contemporary approach to the study of the intersections of geography and religion not only highlights the role of religion in affecting landscape changes and in assigning sacred meanings to specific places, but also acknowledges how in turn, religious ideology and practice at specific spaces are guided and transformed by their location.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Religious experiences and the belief in religious meanings transforms physical spaces into sacred spaces. These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such sacred spaces. These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies.&lt;ref name="Kong2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2005|title=Religious schools: for spirit, (f)or nation|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=23|pages=615–631|doi=10.1068/d394|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2002|title= In Search of Permanent Homes: Singapore's House Churches and the Politics of Space |journal=Urban Studies|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1573–1586|doi=10.1080/00420980220151664}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of sacred spaces) to present religious meaning and significance.

A key focus in the study of sacred places is the politics of identity, belonging and meaning that are ascribed to sacred sites, and the constant negotiations for power and legitimacy. Particularly in multicultural settings, the contestation for legitimacy, public approval, and negotiations for use of particular spaces are at the heart of determining how communities understand, internalise and struggle to compete for the right to practice their religious traditions in public spaces.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

==Community and identity==
Religion may be a starting point to examine issues of ethnic identity formation and the construction of ethnic identity&lt;ref name="Peach2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peach|first=Ceri|date=2002|title=Social Geography: New Religions and Ethnoburbs – Contrasts with Cultural Geography|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=26|issue=2|pages=252–260|doi=10.1191/0309132502ph368pr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers studying the negotiations of religious identity within various communities are often concerned with the overt articulation of religious identity, for example, how adherents in different locations establish their distinctive (religious and cultural) identities through their own understandings of the religion, and how they externally present their religious adherence (in terms of religious practice, ritual and behaviour). As an overarching theme, the articulation of religious identity is concerned with material aspects of symbolizing religious identity (such as architecture and the establishment of a physical presence), with negotiations and struggles in asserting religious identity in the face of persecution and exclusion and with personal practices of religious ritual and behaviour that re-establishes one’s religious identity&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chivallon|first=Christine|date=2001|title=Religion as Space for the Expression of Caribbean Identity in the United Kingdom |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=19| issue=4|pages=461–483|doi=10.1068/d2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gale|first=Richard|date=2007|title=The Place of Islam in the Geography of Religion: Trends and Intersections|journal=Geography Compass|volume=1| issue=5|pages=1015–1036|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New geographies of religion==
As research on geography and religion has grown, one of the new focuses of geographical research examines the rise of religious fundamentalism, and the resulting impact this has on the geographical contexts in which it develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stump|first=Roger|title=Boundaries of Faith: Geographical Perspectives on Religious Fundamentalism| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, migration processes have resulted in the development of religious pluralism in numerous countries, and the landscape changes that accompany the movement and settlement of communities defined by religion is a key focus in the study of geography and religion.&lt;ref name="Kong2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2010|title=Global shifts, theoretical shifts: Changing geographies of religion |journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=755–776|doi=10.1177/0309132510362602}}&lt;/ref&gt; More work needs to be done to examine the intersections and collisions that occur due to the movement of communities (for example, the migration of Muslim communities to western countries) and highlight how these communities negotiate their religious experiences in new spaces.&lt;ref name="Peach2002" /&gt; Recent research in this area has been published by [[Barry A. Vann]] who analyzes Muslim population shifts in the Western world and the theological factors that play into these demographic trends. &lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Vann (2011), ''Puritan Islam: The Geoexpansion of the Muslim World''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another new area of interest in the study of geography and religion explores different sites of religious practice beyond the ‘officially sacred’ – sites such as religious schools, media spaces, banking and financial practices (for example, [[Islamic banking]]) and home spaces are just some of the different avenues that take into account informal, everyday spaces that intersect with religious practice and meaning.&lt;ref name="Kong2010" /&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
The [[Sangam period]] in [[Tamilakam]] (c. 500 BCE to 300 CE) was characterized by the coexistence of many religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] alongside the [[ethnic religion]]s of the [[Tamil people]]. The monarchs of the time practiced religious tolerance and openly encouraged religious discussions and invited teachers of every sect to the public halls to preach their doctrines.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

==Tamil religions==
Tamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as [[Tamil Nadu]] and the northern and eastern part of [[Sri Lanka]]. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Réunion]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mauritius]] and in countries in [[Europe]]. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.

===Early Tamil religion===
A Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in [[South India]] several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the [[Tholkappiyam]] (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an "academy" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.

Ancient Tamil grammatical works [[Tholkappiyam]], the ten anthologies [[Pathuppāṭṭu]], the eight anthologies [[Eṭṭuttokai]] sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. [[Murugan]] was glorified as, ''the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,'' as ''the favored god of the Tamils.''&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"&gt;Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] was also seen as the supreme God.&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"/&gt; Early iconography of [[Murugan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shiva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

Simoons| year = 1998| page = 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangam landscape]] was classified into five categories, ''thinais'', based on the mood, the season and the land. [[Tolkappiyam]], mentions that each of these ''thinai'' had an associated deity such [[Murugan]] in ''Kurinji''-the hills, [[Thirumal]] in ''Mullai''-the forests, [[Kotravai|Kaali]] in ''Pālai''-the deserts, [[Indra]] in ''Marutham''-the plains and [[Varuna]] in ''Neithal''-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to [[Dravidian languages]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}} This represents an early religious and cultural fusion{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}}{{refn|name=Lockard|Lockard: "The encounters that resulted from Aryan migration brought together several very different peoples and cultures, reconfiguring Indian society. Over many centuries a fusion of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryan]] and [[Tamil people]] occurred, a complex process that historians have labeled the Indo-Aryan synthesis."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}} Lockard: "Hinduism can be seen historically as a synthesis of Aryan beliefs with Harappan and other Tamil traditions that developed over many centuries."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}}} or synthesis{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} between ancient Tamils and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.{{sfn|Tiwari|2002|p=v}}{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=218-219}}{{sfn|Larson|1995|p=81}}

The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiruchandran|first=Selvy|title=Ideology, caste, class, and gender|year=1997|publisher=Vikas Pub. House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manickam|first=Valliappa Subramaniam|title=A glimpse of Tamilology|year=1968|publisher=Academy of Tamil Scholars of Tamil Nadu|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIQOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=sangam+priestess&amp;dq=sangam+priestess}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lal|first=Mohan|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot), Volume 5|year=2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=8126012218|pages=4396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veriyattam===
"Veriyattam" refers to [[spirit possession]] of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Srinivasa|title=History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D.|year=1929|publisher=Asian Educational Services|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.K. |last=Venkatasubramanian|title=Music as History in TamilNadu|year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=9380607067|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzurjfF3AE4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Twenty+two+poets+of+the+Sangam+age+in+as+many+as#v=onepage&amp;q=Twenty%20two%20poets%20of%20the%20Sangam%20age%20in%20as%20many%20as&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nadukkal===
Among the early Tamils the practice of erecting [[hero stone]]s (''nadukkal'') had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shashi|first=S. S.|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh: Volume 100|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramanium|first=N.|title=Śaṅgam polity: the administration and social life of the Śaṅgam Tamils|year=1980|publisher=Ennes Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theyyam===

[[Theyyam]] is a ritual shaman dance popular in [[Kerala]] and parts of Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]]. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors,  is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.

The early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.

The layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|guardian deity]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic= காவல் கடவுள்|trans=kāval kaṭavuḷ}}) has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 14|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinity of kings==

===Pre-Sangam and Sangam age===
Throughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=William P.|title=The sacred marriage of a Hindu goddess|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a ''koyil'', which means the "residence of God". The Modern Tamil word for temple is [[koil]] ({{lang-ta|கோயில்}}). Titular worship was also given to Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anand|first=Mulk Raj|title=Splendours of Tamil Nadu |year=1980|publisher=Marg Publications|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;noj=1&amp;prmdo=1&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=565&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Koyil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;oq=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Kovil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3...0.0.0.8227.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0.DdIt9d1ZNjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Pran Nath|title=History of South India|year=1979|publisher=S.

Words meaning 'King', like ''kō'' ({{lang-ta|கோ}} "King"), ''iṟai'' ({{lang|ta|இறை}} "Emperor") and ''āṇḍavan'' ({{lang|ta|ஆண்டவன்}} "Conqueror") now primarily refer to Gods. Mōcikīraṉār in the [[Purananuru]] says: {{Cquote|&lt;center&gt;Not rice, not water,&lt;br&gt; only the King is the life-breath&lt;br&gt; of a kingdom.&lt;center&gt;}}
The Kingdom suffered by famine or disorder when the King erred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A.K.|first=Ramanujan|title=Poems of Love and War: From the Eight Anthologies and the Ten Long Poems of Classical Tamil|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements were incorporated later into [[Hinduism]] like the legendary marriage of [[Shiva]] to Queen Meenatchi who ruled [[Madurai]] or [[Legendary early Chola kings#Cholas of the Sangam period|Wanji-ko]], a god who later merged into [[Indra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=Bernard|title=Tamil oratory and the Dravidian aesthetic: democratic practice in south India|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tolkappiyar]] refers to the [[Three Crowned Kings]] as the "Three Glorified by Heaven", ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=வான்புகழ் மூவர்|trans=Vāṉpukaḻ Mūvar}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A.

At the birth of [[Raja Raja Chola I]], the Thiruvalangadu inscription states, "Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very [[Thirumal]], the protector of the three worlds, descended on earth..."

[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Murugan]] temple at Salavanakuppam near [[Mahabalipuram]]]]

The brick temple excavated in 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/21/stories/2005092104692000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; dates to the [[Sangam period]] and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before ''shilpa shastras'' were written

[[File:Skanda, from Kannuaj.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|Sculpture of the god Murugan]]
During the Sangam period, [[Shiva]], [[Murugan]], [[Thirumal]] and Kotravai were some of the popular [[deity|deities]]. The poetic division of the landscape into [[Sangam landscape#Poetic Attributes of the Landscapes|five regions]] also associated each region with its own patron deity.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=381}}
The people of the pastoral lands or the [[Sangam landscape#Mullai .E2.80.93 Forests|Mullai]] regions worshipped [[Thirumal]]. The [[Sangam landscape#Marutham .E2.80.93 Cropland|Marutham]] people worshipped [[Indra]] or ''Ventan'', while the [[Sangam landscape#Neithal .E2.80.93 Seashore|Neithal]] people considered [[Varuna]]n or ''Katalon'' to be their patron deity and the [[Sangam landscape#Paalai .E2.80.93 Wastelands|Palai]] people worshipped [[Korravai]] or [[Kali]]. Other popular deities of this age were [[Kama]] the god of love, [[Surya]] the sun, [[Chandra]] the moon and [[Yama]] the god of death. The [[Brahmin]]s of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=231}}

The temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=382}} The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' and the Sangam poems such as ''[[Kaliththokai]]'', ''[[Mullaippāṭṭu]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' mention several kinds of temples such as the ''Puranilaikkottam'' or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the ''Netunilaikkottam'' or the tall temple, the ''Palkunrakkottam'' the temple on top of a hill, the ''Ilavantikaippalli'' or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the ''Elunilaimatam'' or a seven storeyed temple, the ''Katavutkatinakar'' or the temple city.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnan|2005|p=19}}

Some of the popular festivals of this age were [[Karthikai Deepam|Karthigaideepam]], Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.{{sfn|Balambal|1998|p=6}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Tamil Jain}}
The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the [[Sangam period]]. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), [[Tolkāppiyam]], was a Jain.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Narendra   | title = Encyclopaedia of Jainism  | publisher = Anmol Publications  | year = 2001  | pages = 3144  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pHZwgrLlOkUC&amp;dq  | isbn = 978-81-261-0691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Early Tamil epigraphy from the earliest times to the sixth century A.D.

Scholars consider the [[Tirukkural]] by [[Valluvar]] to be the work by a Jain.&lt;ref&gt;Tirukkural, Vol. 1,  S.M. Diaz, Ramanatha Adigalar Foundation, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiruvalluvar and his Tirukkural, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kural, P. S. Sundaram, Penguin Classics, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).

[[Silappatikaram]], a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, [[Ilango Adigal]]. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and [[Shaivism]]. The main characters of this work, [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.

According to [[George L. Hart]], the legend of the [[Tamil Sangams]] or "literary assemblies: was based on the Jain ''sangham'' at [[Madurai]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend."&lt;ref&gt;The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems, Prof. George Hart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially [[Shaivism]]. Still, the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties embraced Jainism.

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Tamil Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.6|Footprint of Buddha engraved on stone, c. 1st century CE]]

The [[Buddhist]]s worshiped the impressions of [[Buddha]]’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=232}} The [[Cilapatikaram|Silapatikaram]] mentions that the [[monk]]s worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. [[Manimekalai]] is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of [[Buddhism]] of the daughter of [[Kovalan]] and [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]].

In the Buddhist [[Viharas]] or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

==Judaism==

==Philosophies of religion==

===Secularism===
The secular identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Tamil Literature: Introductory articles|year=1990|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Sangam literature]] is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among [[Tamil people]].

The [[Tamil books of Law]], particularly the [[Tirukkural]], is considered as the [[Perennial philosophy]] of [[Tamil culture]] because of its universalisability.

===Ūzh and Vinai===
Ūzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny'  and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Tamil studies, Issues 31–32|year=1987|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Inca civilization}}
In the heterogeneous [[Inca Empire]], [[polytheistic]] religions were practiced. Some deities, such as [[Pachamama]] and [[Viracocha]], were known throughout the empire, while others were localised.

==Deities==
[[Image:Sol de Mayo-Bandera de Argentina.svg|'''Inti''' or [[Sun of May]] of the [[flag of Argentina]], 1818|right|thumb|x216px]]
Inca deities occupied the three realms:
*''[[Hanan Pacha|hanan pacha]]'', the celestial realm in the sky.
*''[[Ukhu Pacha|ukhu pacha]]'', the inner earth realm.
*''[[Kay Pacha|kay pacha]]'', the outer earth realm, where humans live.

=== Deities of the Official Pantheon ===
*[[File:Viracocha (porta do sol - detalhe).jpg|thumb|Viracocha depicted in the wall as a man]]'''[[Viracocha]]''':&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156911932|title=The history of the Incas|last=1532-1592.|first=Sarmiento de Gamboa, Pedro,|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Bauer, Brian S., Smith-Oka, Vania, 1975-|isbn=9780292714137|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=156911932}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was typically seen as a white male human and known as the creator of humanity and everything else in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708564500|title=Gods, goddesses, and mythology|date=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|others=Littleton, C.

When the Spaniards came to the Inca territory, the Inca thought they were god like because of their similarities in appearance with Viracocha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Inti]]:'''  Inti was one of the most important gods to the Inca people and known as the sun god. He is typically viewed as a boy from the Inca society and was also known as a golden disk with fire like rays coming and a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62805010|title=Incan mythology and other myths of the Andes|last=Greg.|first=Roza,|date=2008|publisher=Rosen Central|isbn=1404207392|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=62805010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca believed the sun was a key element for agriculture by protecting and helping with the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The temple dedicated to Inti was the [[Coricancha]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (a.k.a. The Golden Enclosure), which was one of the most important temples for the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Inside Coricancha was a miniature field of corn and the corn was made out of gold. Annually, the emperor would "farm" this as a tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Viracocha did not start out as the top deity in Inca religion, Inti was the first original and most powerful god. The transition from Inti to Virachocha has a couple of theories including: 1. The [[Inca society]] and people developed intellectually and started to question Inti's power. They questioned why an all powerful god did the same thing everyday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2. The society moved forward and they started going more towards monotheism (one god ruled over everything else, not that there was only one god). Since Viracocha was seen as a human, they saw this as being more powerful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Illapa (Inti-Illapa):''' The name of this god means thunder and controls things like weather, rain, and lightning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46449340|title=The Incas|last=N.,|first=D'Altroy, Terence|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405116765|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=46449340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca valued this god because Illapa was in control of the weather and the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the Inca society saw the image of this deity as a man wearing a sling.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Every time that Illapa would use the sling it would create the thunder heard by the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''[[Mama Killa|Mamaquilla]] (Kilyamama'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''):''' The name of this god in the Inca language can be translated into Mother Moon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of the Inca society recognized this deity as female and was also seen as a silver disk with a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was the wife of the deity Inti and was also in control of calendars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This god was in charge of calendars because of the moons cycle which the Inca could track.  All the temples that worshiped Mamaquilla were worked on by priestesses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''[[Pachamama]]:''' The name of this god translates to Earth Mother and is known as a female among the Inca society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Inca saw her as a protector of their crops/fields and a god of fertility to help their crops grow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Mamacocha:''' The meaning of this gods name from the Inca language is Mother of Lakes and is widely known as a female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The job of this deity is to keep the world strong and provide sources of water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Stella Deities:''' These are deities formed using constellations or other cosmology features and are mostly believed to be of animals or activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the book ''Inca Water Worship and Religion'', an example would be "Urcuchillay, which is known to western astronomers as Lira, [who] was thought to protect llamas and alpacas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Huacas'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;''':'''  Anything, including people, places, and objects, in the world that the Inca believed had a supernatural spirit, were called Huacas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The size of the Huaca determined how much power it had. For example, mountains were considered some of the more powerful Huacas. The Inca worshiped and cared for them similar to the other deities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Household gods=== 
[[File:Camelid Conopa, 1470-1532, 36.683.jpg|thumb|Caullama conopa, 1470-1532]]
In addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as ''chancas'' or ''conopas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth Mills |authorlink= |title=Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640-1750 |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |chapter=Chancas and Conopas |pages=75–100 |quote= | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOo9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |isbn=9780691155487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conopa were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as ''zarap conopa'' for [[maize]], ''papap conopa'' for potatoes and caullama for [[llamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew James Hamilton |authorlink= |title=Scale and the Incas |year=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |pages=60–63 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sC1KDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 |isbn=9781400890194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pablo Joseph de Arriaga |translator=L.

==Origin==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Many ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.

The earliest ancestors of the Inca were known as Ayar, the first of which was [[Manco Cápac|Manco Capac]] or Ayar Manco. Inca mythology tells of his travels, in which he and the Ayar shaped and marked the land and introduced the cultivation of [[maize]].

==Religious expansion==
Religious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.&lt;ref name=Steele2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Paul Richar d|title=Handbook of World Mythology |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576073544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duality==
A theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the ''hanan pacha'' and the ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha''. ''Hanan pacha'', the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha'' were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. ''Kay pacha'', the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between ''hanan pacha'' and ''ukhu pacha''. The realms were represented by the [[condor]] (upper world), [[Cougar|puma]] (outer earth) and [[snake]] (inner earth).

Sacred sites or things named ''[[Huaca|wak'a]]'' were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a ''wak'a'' was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A ''wak'a'' could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use [[prayer]] and offerings to communicate with a ''wak'a'' for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|sacrificed a child]] (''[[qhapaq hucha]]'') or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Archaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: "Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhard |first1=Johan |first2=Constanza |last2=Ceruti |title=Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice Among the Incas |journal=Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of Astronomy in Culture |year=2005 |volume=19 |pages=2 |issn=0190-9940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
The Incas also used [[divination]]. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.

Divination was essential before taking any action.  Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices.  These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children. &lt;ref&gt;Eerdman's Handbook to the World's Religions, 1982, Lion Publishing, Herts, England, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Divination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:
{{quote|The native elements are more obvious in the case of the sunrise divination. Apachetas, [[coca]] and the sun were major elements in pre-Conquest religion, and divination, the worship of sacred mountains and the bringing retribution against enemies were important ritual practices.&lt;ref name=Rowe1946&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of South American Indians Vol. 2 The Andean Civilizations |year=1946 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington |pages=183–330 |last=Rowe |first=John H. |editor=Julian H. Steward |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/emeritus/rowe/pub/rowe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|292–314}}}}

== Mummification ==
The rulers of the Inca empire, such as the last united Inca ruler [[Huayna Capac]], were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces.These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Juan Polo de Ondegardo y Zárate, who was newly appointed as the Chief Magistrate of [[Cuzco]] in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the [[Inca]] from committing their  “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in [[Lima]].&lt;ref name="Hospital"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Brian S.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Antonio C.|date=2007|title=The Hospital of San Andrés (Lima, Peru) and the Search for the Royal Mummies of the Incas|journal=Fieldiana Anthropology|volume=39|pages=1–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown.The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco’s plaza for the public to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peruvian Traditions|last1=Palma|first1=Ricardo|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. [[Francisco Pizarro]] stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt; The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui’s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with [[Huascar]] in the civil war.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, the [[Inca]] started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by [[Juan de Betanzos]]. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their huaques, or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around [[Cuzco]] in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo’s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads… their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried.The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andres in [[Lima]] because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]] awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates were Christians]], over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;Baruch A. Shalev, ''100 Years of Nobel Prizes'' (2003), Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors , p.57&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study that was done by [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in 1998, 60% of [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel prize laureates in physics]] from 1901 to 1990 had a [[Christian]] background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=physicsfuller Nobel prize winners in physics from 1901 to 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1901-2013, 22% of all Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Biographies: Nobel Prize Laureates|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nobels.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.&lt;ref name=Census.ie&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile 7 – Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile%207%20Education%20Ethnicity%20and%20Irish%20Traveller%20entire%20doc.pdf|publisher=Census Statistics Office|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education. [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and [[Muslims]] are at about the national average.. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradley R.E.|title=Christians are hate-filled hypocrites-- and other lies you've been told : a sociologist shatters myths from the secular and christian media|year=2010|publisher=Bethany House|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=9780764207464|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.&lt;ref name="Smith Souls"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Souls in Transition: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging adults|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195371796|pages=248–251|author2=Patricia Snell |quote=However, something very interesting emerged when scholars took a second look at the question more recently. They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

However, both groups were still a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=How Religious are America’s College and University Professors?|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf|publisher=SSRC|author2=Solon Simmons |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Phil | last1=Zuckerman | year=2009 | title=Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | journal=Sociology Compass | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=949–971 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228104545/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | archivedate=2014-12-28 | df= }}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=267–268|quote= The effects of income become insignificant, however, the impact of education actually reverses in the United States: ''it is the more educated who attend church most frequently.'' It therefore appears that the typical socioeconomic profile of churchgoing is indeed somewhat distinctive in the United States when compared with other wealthy countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University? Conversion Experience, Creativity and Intelligence|url=http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_6/3-jirrs6-dutton.pdf|publisher=Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

|[[Afghanistan]]
|Population 31,410,000, Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Sunni Muslim 80%, Shia Muslim 19%, other 1%
|Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Reliable data on religious demography is difficult to obtain because an official nationwide census has not been conducted in decades. U.S. government estimates indicate a population of approximately 30.4 million, with Sunni Muslims comprising 80 percent of the population, Shia Muslims making up about 19 percent, and other religious groups comprising less than 1 percent. The Ismailis, who self identify as a Shia denomination, comprise approximately 5 percent of the total population. Leaders of minority religious communities estimate there are 350 Sikh families and 30 Hindu families. Estimates of the Bahá'í and Christian communities are less clear because neither group practices openly for fear of persecution. Reportedly, the Christian community is between 500 and 8,000 persons and the Bahá'í community is approximately 2,000 persons. In addition, there are small numbers of practitioners of other religions. There is one known Jewish citizen.
There are three active gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) in Kabul and 10 in other parts of the country; there were 64 gurdwaras throughout the country before the mujahideen era, when many were seized. There are five remaining Hindu mandirs (temples) in three cities: two in Kabul, one of which shares a wall with a mosque, one in Jalalabad, one in Helmand, and one in Kandahar.
Afghanistan's last known Jew maintains Kabul's sole synagogue, and there are also three defunct synagogues in Herat, which are no longer in use for lack of a Jewish community. There are no public Christian churches. Afghan Christians worship alone or in small congregations in private homes. Many Afghan Christians converted while living as refugees in third countries. Chapels and churches for noncitizens of various faiths are located on several military bases, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and at the Italian embassy in Kabul. Buddhist foreigners are free to worship in Hindu temples.
Followers of the Bahá'í Faith have practiced in the country for approximately 150 years. The community is predominantly based in Kabul, although some Bahá'ís remain in Kandahar.

|[[Albania]]
|Population 3,200,000, Christian 18.0%, Muslim 80.3%, Unaffiliated 1.4%, Other Religion 0.2%
|Muslim 56.7%, Roman Catholic 10%, Orthodox 6.8%, atheist 2.5%, Bektashi (a Sufi order) 2.1%, other 5.7%, unspecified 16.2%
note: all mosques and churches were closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November 1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice (2011 est.) 
|Bahá'í 0.2%, Christian 31.6%, Muslim 62.7%, Atheist 0.5%, Agnostic 5.0% 
|According to the 2011 census, the population is 2.8 million. It is difficult to assess the size of religious groups because nearly 20 percent of respondents declined to answer the optional census question about religious affiliation. Several religious leaders challenge the census results. According to the census, Sunni Muslims constitute nearly 57 percent of the population, Roman Catholics 10 percent, Orthodox Christians (the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania) nearly 7 percent, and Bektashi (a form of Shia Sufism) 2 percent. Other groups present include Bahá'ís, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The State Committee on Cults reports more than 230 religious groups, organizations, foundations, and educational institutions operating in the country.

|[[Algeria]]
|Population 35,470,000, Christian 0.2%, Muslim 97.9%, Unaffiliated 1.8%
|Muslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian and Jewish) &lt;1% (2012 est.) 
|Christian 0.2%, Muslim 98.5%, Agnostic 1.2%
|The population is 37.1 million according to January estimates from the Office of National Statistics. Over 99 percent is Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, and a small community of [[Ibadi]] Muslims residing in the province of Ghardaia. Some religious leaders estimate there are only a few hundred Jews. Unofficial estimates of the number of Christians in Algeria vary between 30,000 and 70,000. For security reasons, due mainly to civil conflict, Christians concentrated in the cities of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran in the mid-1990s. According to Christian leaders, evangelical Christians, including Seventh-day Adventists, account for the largest number of Christians. Most evangelicals live in the Kabylie region. Next in size are the Methodists and members of other Protestant denominations, followed by Roman Catholics. A significant proportion of Christian foreign residents, whose numbers are difficult to estimate, are students and illegal immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe. One religious leader estimates there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Egyptian Coptic Christians living in the country. There are no statistics on the number of religious conversions; however, according to the Minister of Religious Affairs, 150 foreigners converted to Islam and 50 citizens converted to Christianity in 2011. Christian leaders estimate that dozens of Algerians have converted to Christianity in the past two years. Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments (MRA) report that there are approximately 16,000 mosques and 24,000 imams in Algeria.

|The government estimates the population to be 78,000. There are no official statistics on religious affiliation, but observers estimate that approximately 90 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. Smaller religious groups include Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Anglicans, Seventh-day Adventists, Bahá'ís, and members of the Unification Church. There are also small numbers of members of other Christian groups, including the New Apostolic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Jehovah's Witnesses.
The population consists largely of immigrants from Spain, Portugal, and France; citizens constitute 37 percent of inhabitants. Immigrants are generally also Catholic.

|Christian 93.3%, Ethnoreligionist 4.6%, Muslim 1.1%, Atheist 0.2%, Agnostic 0.8%
|The government estimates the population to be approximately 20 million. The last official census was in 1970. The majority of the population is Christian. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 55 percent of the population is Catholic, while the government estimates that 70 percent is. The National Institute for Religious Affairs estimates 25 percent of the population combines Christian and traditional beliefs; 10 percent is Protestant, including Methodists, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Congregationalists (United Church of Christ), and Assemblies of God; and 5 percent belongs to Brazilian evangelical churches. A small portion of the rural population practices animism or indigenous religious beliefs. There is a small Muslim community, unofficially estimated at 80,000 to 90,000, most of whom are migrants from West Africa or of Lebanese origin. Some Muslim sources put these figures closer to 500,000, but it is not possible to confirm the estimate.
There are approximately 450 to 500 Jews, primarily Israelis.

|According to a U.S. government estimate in July, the population of Antigua and Barbuda is 89,000. According to the 2001 census, 74 percent of the population is Christian. The Anglican Church is the largest religious group, accounting for 26 percent of the population. The Methodist, Moravian, and Roman Catholic churches account for less than 10 percent each. The United Evangelical Association, an organization that includes most independent evangelical churches, claims 25 percent of the population, and Jehovah's Witnesses number more than 1,000 members. Non-Christians include an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 Rastafarians, more than 200 Muslims, nearly 200 Hindus, and approximately 50 members of the Bahá'í Faith. There are also approximately 200 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Leaders of diverse religious groups note the recent growth of evangelical Protestant communities. While exact numbers are difficult to confirm (and national census data does not track religious affiliation), the Jewish population is approximately 250,000-300,000, generally considered the largest Jewish population in Latin America. Similarly, the Muslim population, an estimated 400,000 to 1 million, is also the largest in Latin America.

Most of the Nepali-speaking minority is Hindu, although there are small numbers of Christians and Buddhists. Hindus represent approximately 25 percent of the population. Hindu temples exist in southern areas. Christians are reportedly concentrated in towns and in the south.
According to unconfirmed estimates, there are between 3,000 and 15,000 Christians in the country. There are also reports of a few Muslims. Although priests of the animist Bon tradition often officiate at and include Bon rituals in Buddhist festivals, very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religion. The Sharchops ethnic group, which forms the majority of the population of eastern Bhutan, reportedly practices Tibetan Buddhism combined with elements of the Bon tradition and Hinduism.
According to an April estimate by the Ministry of Labor and Resources, just over 55,000 Indian laborers are present in the country, most of whom are Hindu or Muslim.

|The population is 3.8 million, according to a June 2011 government statistics agency estimate. The country's territory is divided into two entities, the Federation and the RS, with a separate administrative district for Brcko. According to unofficial estimates from the statistics agency, Muslims constitute 45 percent of the population, Serbian Orthodox Christians 36 percent, Roman Catholics 15 percent, Protestants 1 percent, and other communities, including Jews, 3 percent. There is a strong correlation between ethnicity and religion: Bosniaks are generally associated with Islam, Bosnian Serbs with the Serbian Orthodox Church, and Bosnian Croats with the Roman Catholic Church. The Jewish community has approximately 1,000 members and maintains an historic place in society by virtue of centuries of coexistence with other religious communities and its active role in the Inter-Religious Council, which mediates among the four religious communities regarded as "traditional" (Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish).
The majority of Serbian Orthodox adherents live in the RS, and the majority of Muslims and Catholics in the Federation. Within the Federation distinct, Muslim and Catholic majority areas remain, with most Catholics in Herzegovina and areas of central Bosnia and most Muslims elsewhere in central Bosnia and Sarajevo. The Jewish community, similar to Protestants and most other small religious communities, has its largest membership in Sarajevo.

Groups together constituting about 2 percent of the population include Catholics, Armenian Christians, Jews, evangelical Protestants, and others. There are 115 registered religious groups in addition to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (BOC).
Some religious minorities are concentrated geographically. Many Muslims, including ethnic Turks, Roma, and "Pomaks" (descendants of Slavic Bulgarians who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule) live in the Rhodope Mountains along the southern border with Greece. Ethnic Turkish and Roma Muslims also live in large numbers in the northeast and along the Black Sea coast. Nearly 40 percent of Catholics live in and around Plovdiv. The majority of the small Jewish community lives in Sofia and along the Black Sea coast. Protestants are widely dispersed, but are more numerous in areas with large Roma populations.

Approximately 19 percent is Roman Catholic, 4 percent belongs to various Protestant groups, and 15 percent maintain exclusively indigenous beliefs. Statistics on religious affiliation are approximate because Muslims and Christians often adhere simultaneously to some aspects of indigenous religious beliefs.
Muslims reside largely in the northern, eastern, and western border regions, and Christians live in the center of the country. Persons practice indigenous religious beliefs throughout the country, especially in rural communities. The capital has a mixed Muslim and Christian population.

|Although there has not been a census since 1983, a 2012 U.S. government source estimates the population to be 54,584,700. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion. The principal minority religious groups include Christians (primarily Baptists, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans, along with several other small Protestant denominations), Muslims (mostly Sunni), Hindus, and practitioners of traditional Chinese and indigenous religions. Some sources suggest that approximately 90 percent of the population practices Buddhism, 4 percent Christianity, and 4 percent Islam. These statistics likely underestimate the non-Buddhist proportion of the population. A very small Jewish community in Rangoon has a synagogue but no resident rabbi.
The country is ethnically diverse, with significant correlation between ethnicity and religion. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion among the majority Burman ethnic group and also among the Shan, Rakhine, and Mon ethnic minorities. Christianity is dominant among the Kachin, Chin, and Naga ethnic groups. Christianity also is practiced widely among the Karen and Karenni ethnic groups; although many Karen and Karenni are Buddhist and some Karen are Muslim. Citizens of South Asian origin, who are concentrated in major cities and in the south-central region, are predominantly Hindu or Muslim, although some are Christian. Islam is practiced widely in Rakhine State and in Rangoon, Irrawaddy, Magwe, and Mandalay Divisions, where some Burmese, ethnic Indians, ethnic Bengalis, ethnic Kaman, and Rohingya practice the religion. Chinese ethnic minorities generally practice traditional Chinese religions. Traditional indigenous beliefs are practiced widely among smaller ethnic groups in the highland regions.

|The population is over 14.9 million, according to a July 2012 U.S. government estimate. An estimated 96 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist. The vast majority of ethnic-Khmer Cambodians are Buddhist, and there is a close association between Buddhism, Khmer cultural traditions, and identity and daily life. According to the Ministry of Cults and Religion, the Mahayana school of Buddhism has approximately 19,550 followers and has 167 temples throughout the country.
Approximately 2.4 percent of the population, predominantly ethnic Chams, is Muslim, typically living in towns and rural fishing villages on the banks of the Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong River, as well as in Kampot Province. There are four branches of Islam represented in the country: the Malay-influenced Shafi branch, practiced by as much as 90 percent of Muslims; the Saudi-Kuwaiti-influenced Salafi (Wahhabi) branch; the indigenous Iman-San branch; and the Kadiani branch. The remaining 1.6 percent of the population is Bahá'í, Jewish, ethnic Vietnamese Cao Dai, or members of various Christian denominations.

|According to Bureau of Statistics information as of 1 November 2010, the population of mainland China is 1,339,725,000. In its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council during its Universal Periodic Review in February 2009, the government stated that there were "more than 100 million followers of different religious faiths and the religious population is steadily increasing." However, accurate estimates of the numbers of religious believers vary widely depending on the source. For example, a 2007 survey conducted by East China Normal University states that 31.4 percent of citizens aged 16 and over, or 300 million people, are religious believers. The same survey estimates that there are 200 million Buddhists, Taoists, or worshippers of folk gods, although accurate estimates are difficult to make because many adherents practice exclusively at home.
According to the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), there are more than 21 million Muslims in the country; unofficial estimates range as high as 50 million. Hui Muslims are concentrated primarily in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces. Uighur Muslims live primarily in Xinjiang. According to Xinjiang Statistics Bureau data from 2010, there are approximately 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang.
The 2011 Blue Book of Religions, produced by the Institute of World Religions at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a research institution directly under the State Council, reports the number of Protestant Christians to be between 23 and 40 million. A June 2010 SARA report estimates there are 16 million Protestants affiliated with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM). According to 2010 Pew Research Center estimates, there are 67 million Protestant Christians, of whom 23 million are affiliated with the TSPM.
According to SARA, more than six million Catholics worship in sites registered by the Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The Pew Center estimates that there are nine million Catholics on the mainland, 5.7 million of whom are affiliated with the CPA.
In addition to the five nationally recognized religions, local governments have legalized certain religious communities and practices, such as Orthodox Christianity in Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. Some ethnic minorities retain traditional religions, such as Dongba among the Naxi people in Yunnan and Buluotuo among the Zhuang in Guangxi. Worship of the folk deity Mazu reportedly has been reclassified as "cultural heritage" rather than religious practice.
Prior to the government's 1999 ban on Falun Gong, a self-described spiritual discipline, it was estimated that there were 70 million adherents.

||According to official data from China's sixth decennial national census, conducted in November 2010, the TAR's 2,716,400 ethnic Tibetans make up 91 percent of the TAR's total population. Official census data also show ethnic Tibetans constituting 1.8 percent of the total population of Gansu Province, 24.4 percent in Qinghai Province, 2.1 percent in Sichuan Province, and 0.3 percent in Yunnan Province.
Most ethnic Tibetans practice Tibetan Buddhism, although a sizeable minority practices Bon, an indigenous religion, and very small minorities practice Islam, Catholicism, or Protestantism. Some scholars estimate that there are as many as 400,000 Bon followers across the Tibetan Plateau. Scholars also estimate that there are up to 5,000 ethnic Tibetan Muslims and 700 ethnic Tibetan Catholics in the TAR.
Many Tibetan government officials and CCP members in Tibet are religious believers, despite government and CCP prohibitions against officials’ holding religious beliefs or participating in religious activities.
Other residents of traditionally Tibetan areas include ethnic Han Chinese, many of whom practice Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, or traditional folk religions; Hui Muslims; and non-ethnic Tibetan Catholics and Protestants. Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslims worship at mosques in the TAR. A Catholic church with 560 members is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the eastern TAR. Cizhong (Tsodruk), in Diqing (Dechen) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP), Yunnan Province, is also home to a large Tibetan Catholic congregation. The TAR is home to a small number of Falun Gong adherents, as well as unregistered Christian churches.
According to the State Council Information Office's 2011 White Paper "Sixty Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the TAR has over 1,700 "venues for religious activities and about 46,000 monks and nuns." While no recent data on the number of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in other Tibetan areas of China are available, according to a 2009 article in the People's Daily (the official newspaper of the CCP), altogether in the TAR and in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, there are 3,000 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries with 120,000 Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns.

|The population is 47 million, according to a 2011 World Bank estimate. The government does not keep statistics on religious affiliation, and estimates from religious leaders varied. The Roman Catholic Bishops’ Conference estimates that 90 percent of the population is Catholic, while the Colombian Evangelical Council (CEDECOL) states that approximately 15 percent of the population is Protestant. According to a 2007 press report, 80 percent of the population is Catholic, 14 percent is non-Catholic Christian, 2 percent is agnostic, and the remaining 4 percent belongs to other religious groups, including Islam and Judaism. Other observers estimate that the non-Catholic population consists of five million members of Protestant, including evangelical, groups; 261,000 Seventh-day Adventists; 150,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church); 10,000 Muslims, and 5,000 Jews. There is also a small population of adherents to animism and various syncretic beliefs.
Some religious groups are concentrated in certain geographical regions. Most of those who blend Catholicism with elements of African animism are Afro-Colombians and reside on the Pacific coast. Most Jews reside in major cities, most Muslims on the Caribbean coast, and most adherents of indigenous animistic religions in remote rural areas. A small Taoist commune is located in a mountainous region of Santander Department.

There is no independent authoritative source on the size or composition of religious groups. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 to 70 percent of the population is Catholic, but only 4 to 5 percent regularly attend mass. Membership in Protestant churches is estimated at 5 percent of the population. Baptists and Pentecostals are likely the largest Protestant denominations. Jehovah's Witnesses report approximately 95,400 members; Methodists estimate 35,000; Seventh-day Adventists 33,000; Anglicans, 22,000; Presbyterians, 15,000; Quakers, 300; and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), 50.

Muslims constitute 99 percent of the population; 90 percent are Shia and 9 percent are Sunni (mostly Turkmen, Arabs, Baluchs, and Kurds living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest, respectively). There are no official statistics available on the size of the Sufi Muslim population; however, some reports estimate between two and five million people practice Sufism.
Groups together constituting the remaining 1 percent of the population include Bahá'ís, Christians, Jews, Sabean-Mandaeans, and Zoroastrians. The two largest non-Muslim minorities are Bahá'ís and Christians. The Bahá'ís number approximately 300,000, and are heavily concentrated in Tehran and Semnan. According to UN figures, 300,000 Christians live in the country, though some NGOs estimate there may be as many as 370,000. The Statistical Center of Iran reports there are 117,700. The majority of Christians are ethnic Armenians concentrated in Tehran and Isfahan. Unofficial estimates of the Assyrian Christian population range between 10,000 and 20,000. There are also Protestant denominations, including evangelical groups. Christian groups outside the country estimate the size of the Protestant Christian community to be less than 10,000, although many Protestant Christians reportedly practice in secret. There are from 5,000 to 10,000 Sabean-Mandaeans. The Statistical Center of Iran estimates there are 25,271 Zoroastrians, who are primarily ethnic Persians; however, Zoroastrian groups report they have 60,000 members.

note: while there has been voluntary relocation of many Christian families to northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of the Saddam HUSSEIN regime in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 est.) 
|Christian 1.5%, Muslim 97.5%, Neoreligionists 0.2%, Atheist 0.2%, Agnostic 0.5%
|According to a July 2012 U.S. government estimate, the population is approximately 31.1 million. Religious demography statistics vary due to violence, internal migration, and governmental tracking capability. Numbers are often estimates from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community leaders, as the government has not yet taken a census.
According to 2010 government statistics, 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Shia Muslims, predominantly Arabs but including Turkmen, Faili (Shia) Kurds, and others, constitute 60 to 65 percent. Arab and Kurdish Sunni Muslims make up 32 to 37 percent of the population. From 18 to 20 percent are Sunni Kurds, 12 to 16 percent are Sunni Arabs, and the remaining 1 to 2 percent are Sunni Turkmen. Approximately 3 percent of the population is composed of Christians, Yezidis, Sabean-Mandaeans, Bahá'ís, Shabaks, Kakais (sometimes referred to as Ahl-e Haqq), and a very small number of Jews. Shia, although predominantly located in the south and east, are the majority in Baghdad and have communities in most parts of the country. Sunnis form the majority in the west, center, and the north of the country.
Christian leaders estimate there are between 400,000 and 850,000 Christians. Approximately two-thirds are Chaldeans (an eastern rite of the Catholic Church), nearly one-fifth are Assyrians (Church of the East), and the remainder are Syriacs (Eastern Orthodox), Armenians (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), Anglicans, and other Protestants. Evangelical Christians reportedly number approximately 5,000.
Yezidi leaders report that most of 500,000 to 700,000 Yezidis reside in the north, with 15 percent in Dahuk Province and the rest in Ninewa Province. Shabak leaders state there are 200,000 to 500,000 Shabaks, who reside mainly near Mosul in Ninewa Province. Estimates of the size of the Sabean-Mandaean community vary widely; according to Sabean-Mandaean leaders, about 4,000 remain in the country, generally along the Tigris and its tributaries. According to a leader in the Sabean-Mandaean community in Basrah, the Sabean-Mandaean population in Basrah has fallen dramatically over the last decade to an estimated 500-750 people. The Bahá'í leadership report fewer than 2,000 members, spread throughout the country in small groups. The Kakai community around Kirkuk is estimated at 24,500 people. Fewer than 10 Jews reportedly reside in Baghdad, and there are unconfirmed reports that very small Jewish communities exist in other parts of the country.
UNHCR reports that 82,260 Iraqi refugees and 218,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) registered returns in 2012. The Ministry of Migration and Displacement (MOMD) reports that 304 of those returns were minorities. A majority of these refugees originally fled Iraq and sought asylum in Syria and Jordan due to sectarian violence triggered by the 2006 bombing of the Samara shrine. According to UNHCR's 2012 monitoring report, the majority of the Iraqi refugees who sought asylum in Iran were Shia families who had fled Iraq before 2003; those who returned in 2012 mostly settled in Najaf and Karbala.
In addition to Iraqi refugees, an estimated 1.1 million people of diverse religious backgrounds remain internally displaced due to sectarian violence between 2006 and 2008. The number of religious minorities internally displaced by violence remains uncertain because many stay with relatives and friends. An international NGO reports that 6,156 Christian families remain internally displaced in the country's northern governorates. The NGO largely attributes the high number to Iraqi Christians fleeing Syria where they had previously found refuge. The NGO attributes the decision of families to resettle in northern Iraq due to the area's relative security compared with elsewhere in the country. Humanitarian organizations working with displaced Christian families note that this vulnerable population is often unable to sell their homes at a reasonable price if they choose to migrate. They also face increasing rental costs in their area of displacement.

|According to the 2011 report of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population is 7.9 million (including settlers living in the Occupied Territories), of which approximately 76 percent are Jews, 19 percent are Muslims, 2 percent are Christians, and 1.6 percent are Druze. The remaining 1.4 percent consists of relatively small communities of Bahá'ís, Samaritans, Karaites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and those classified as "other"—mostly persons who identify themselves as Jewish but do not satisfy the Orthodox Jewish definition of "Jewish" the government uses for civil procedures. The majority of non-Jewish citizens are of Arab origin.
According to the CBS report, 9 percent of the Jewish population identifies as Haredi (also known as "ultra-Orthodox"), 10 percent identifies as Orthodox, 15 percent describe themselves as "traditional, religious," 23 percent call themselves "traditional, not so religious," and 43 percent describe themselves as "nonreligious/secular" Jews, most of whom observe some Jewish traditions. Although not differentiated in official statistics, a 2012 Guttman Institute poll shows that approximately 500,000 traditional and secular Jews associate themselves with the beliefs of the Conservative or Reform streams of Judaism. There is also a community of approximately 20,000 Messianic Jews.
Religious communities often are concentrated in geographical areas according to religious beliefs. The country continues to undergo demographic changes due to the higher birth rate of the Haredi and Muslim communities.
There are approximately 95,000 foreigners permitted to work in the country and an additional 120,000 illegal foreign workers. Foreign workers were members of many different religious groups, including: Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.

|According to a 2011 national statistics institute estimate, the population is 60.63 million. A 2009 report estimates 87 percent of native-born citizens are Roman Catholic, but a 2010 report by the independent research institute Eurispes estimates that only 24 percent regularly participate in Catholic worship services. Religious groups accounting for less than 5 percent of the population include non-Catholic Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Bahá'ís, and Buddhists. Non-Catholic Christian groups include Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses, Assemblies of God, the Confederation of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a number of small Protestant groups.
The number of Muslims continues to grow with immigration from North Africa, South Asia, Albania, and the Middle East. Most Muslims live in the northern part of the country. According to the research branch of the Caritas nongovernmental organization (NGO), of an estimated five million resident foreigners, 1.6 million are Muslim, 1.5 million Orthodox, one million Catholic, and 0.2 million Protestant. The Jewish community is estimated to be 30,000.

Many Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of indigenous religious beliefs.
Traditionally, the north is associated with Islam and the south with Christianity, although practitioners of both religions live throughout the country. In general, political and religious affiliations tend to follow ethnic lines.
Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Harrists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Southern Baptists, Copts, and members of the Assemblies of God.
Other religious groups include Buddhists, Bahá'ís, adherents of the Celestial Church of Christ, followers of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and Bossonists, who follow traditions of the Akan ethnic group.

|Buddhist 56.4%, Chinese Universalist 0.2%, Christian 2.1%, Muslim 0.2%, Shintoist 2.1%, Neoreligionists 25.9%, Atheist 2.9%, Agnostic 10.2%
|The Statistics Bureau estimates the population to be 127.5 million as of October. Because the government does not require religious groups to report their membership, it is difficult to determine the number of members of different groups. A 2009 report by the Agency for Cultural Affairs (ACA) indicates that membership claims by religious groups totaled 207 million. This number, substantially more than the country's population, reflects many citizens’ affiliation with multiple religions. For example, it is common to practice both Buddhist and Shinto rites.
According to the ACA's 2009 statistics, 106 million persons identified themselves as Shinto, 90 million as Buddhist, and 2.1 million as Christian, while nine million followed "other" religions. The category of "other" includes Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Judaism, or no religion. The government does not compile statistics on the number of Muslims in the country specifically, but a 2005 report by academic sources estimates the Muslim population at 63,000.
There is no significant correlation between religious affiliation and ethnicity, politics, or socio-economic status; the society is relatively ethnically and religiously homogeneous. The indigenous Ainu people, who practice an animist faith, are concentrated mainly in Japan's northern island, Hokkaido. Some immigrants and foreign workers practice religions other than Shintoism, the indigenous religion, or Buddhism.

Officially recognized Christian denominations include the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic (Melkite), Armenian Orthodox, Maronite Catholic, Assyrian, Coptic, Anglican, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, and Presbyterian churches. Christian churches that are not officially recognized but registered as "societies" include the Free Evangelical Church, Nazarene Church, Assemblies of God, Christian and Missionary Alliance, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Unrecognized Christian denominations not registered as "societies" include the United Pentecostal Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. The government refers to Chaldean and Syriac Christians among the Iraqi refugee population as "guests." The Baptist Church is registered as a "denomination," but does not enjoy the full privileges of other registered religious groups in the country. The government does not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as a religion.

|According to U.S. government sources, the population is estimated at 24.6 million. In a 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Commission, the country's government reports there are 12,000 Protestants, 10,000 Buddhists, and 800 Roman Catholics. The report also notes that the Cheondogyo Young Friends Party, a government-approved group based on a traditional religious movement, has approximately 15,000 members. South Korean and other foreign religious groups estimate there is a considerably higher number of religious practitioners in the country.
In Pyongyang there are four state-controlled Christian churches: two Protestant churches (Bongsu and Chilgol Churches), the Changchun Roman Catholic Church, and the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church. The Chilgol Church is dedicated to the memory of former leader Kim Il-Sung's mother, Kang Pan-sok, who was a Presbyterian deaconess. The number of regular worshippers at these churches is unknown. Defectors from outside of Pyongyang have no knowledge of these churches.
As part of its 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the government reports the existence of religious organizations such as the Korea Christian Federation, Korea Buddhists’ Federation, Korea Roman Catholic Association, Korea Chondoist Society, and Korea Religionists’ Society.
The government-established Korean Catholic Association (KCA) provides for basic services at the Changchun Church, but has no ties with the Vatican. There are no Catholic priests residing in the country. Visiting priests occasionally provide Mass at the Changchun Church.
According to religious leaders who have traveled to the country, there are Protestant pastors at the Bongsu and Chilgol Churches, although it is not known whether they are resident or visiting pastors.
In its July 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Committee, the government reports the existence of 500 "family worship centers." However, according to the 2012 Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU) White Paper, defectors were unaware of any such centers. Observers stated that "family worship centers" may be part of the state-controlled Korean Christian Federation, while an unknown number of "underground churches" operate apart from the federation and are not recognized by the government. The 2012 KINU White Paper and the 2007 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report, "A Prison Without Bars," include defector testimonies referencing the existence of underground churches, but conclude that their existence was hard to verify.
In July 2009 the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported an estimated 30,000 Christians, while some NGOs and academics estimate there may be up to several hundred thousand "underground" Christians. Others question the existence of a large-scale underground church or conclude that it is impossible to estimate accurately the number of underground religious believers. Individual underground congregations are reportedly very small and typically confined to private homes.
According to the 2012 KINU White Paper, there are an estimated 60 Buddhist temples. Most are regarded as cultural relics, but religious activity is permitted in some. Monks serve as caretakers in many of these temples and foreign visitors find these monks to be knowledgeable about Buddhism. Based on defector testimony, the 2012 KINU White Paper reports that most residents of the country have not heard about Buddhist scriptures and have never seen a Buddhist monk. State-controlled press reported on several occasions that Buddhist ceremonies took place in various locations.
The Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church opened in Pyongyang in 2006.

|According to official government census data released in October, the population is 1.74 million. Census data shows 95.6 percent of the population identifies as Muslim, 2.2 percent as Roman Catholic, and 1.4 percent as Serbian Orthodox. Census categories for "Other," "None," or "No Response" each constitute less than 1 percent. The largest Catholic communities live in Gjakove/Djakovica, Kline/Klina, Prizren, Janjevo, and Pristina. Most members of the SOC reside in ethnically Serb towns and enclaves. Small populations of Protestants live in most cities, with the largest concentration located in Pristina. The largest Jewish community resides in Prizren. The Kosovo Islamic Community is the officially recognized Islamic umbrella group and is known by its Albanian-language acronym BIK; it is responsible for training Muslim clergy and appointing them to mosques throughout the country.
Religion and ethnicity are closely linked; Serbs generally belong to the SOC, while the majority of religiously active citizens of Albanian descent identify themselves as Muslim.
Critics of the census note it does not include residents in the northern region of Mitrovice/Mitrovica and thus significantly under-represents Serbs who belong to the SOC. Anecdotal information also suggests census takers at times automatically assigned Islam to persons without soliciting explicit answers or over their verbal objections.

Most of the remaining 30 percent of citizens are Shia Muslims. There are approximately 150-200 Christian citizens and a small number of Bahá'í citizens. An estimated 150,000 noncitizen residents are Shia. While some areas have relatively high concentrations of either Sunnis or Shia, most areas are religiously well integrated.
There are an estimated 600,000 non-citizen Hindus. The largely non-citizen Christian population is estimated to be more than 450,000. The government-recognized Christian churches include the Roman Catholic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the National Evangelical (Protestant) Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church (referred to in Arabic as the Roman Orthodox Church), the Greek Catholic (Melkite) Church, and the Anglican Church.

The remainder of the population belongs to at least 48 distinct ethnic minority groups, most of which practice animism and ancestor worship. Animism is predominant among Sino-Thai groups, such as the Thai Dam and Thai Daeng, as well as among Mon-Khmer and Burmo-Tibetan groups. Even among lowland Lao, many pre-Buddhist animist beliefs are incorporated into Theravada Buddhist practice, particularly in rural areas. Roman Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Bahá'ís, Mahayana Buddhists, and followers of Confucianism constitute less than 3 percent of the population.

|According to the Beirut-based research firm Statistics Lebanon, the population is approximately 4.3 million. An estimated 27 percent is Sunni Muslim, 27 percent Shia Muslim, 21 percent Maronite Christian, 8 percent Greek Orthodox, 5.6 percent Druze, and 5 percent Greek Catholic, with the remaining 6.5 percent belonging to smaller Christian groups. There are also very small numbers of Jews, Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
The 18 officially recognized religious groups include four Muslim groups, 12 Christian groups, the Druze, and Judaism. The main branches of Islam practiced are Shia and Sunni. The Alawites and the Ismaili ("Sevener") Shia order are the smallest Muslim communities. The Maronite community, the largest Christian group, maintains its centuries-long affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church but has its own patriarch, liturgy, and ecclesiastical customs. The second-largest Christian sect is Greek Orthodox. Other Christians are divided among Greek Catholics, Armenian Orthodox (Gregorians), Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), Syriac Catholics, Assyrians (Nestorians), Chaldeans, Copts, evangelicals (including Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists), and Latins (Roman Catholic). The Druze, who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or "believers in one God," are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Beirut.
Many persons fleeing religious mistreatment and discrimination in neighboring states are immigrants in the country, including Kurds, Shia, and Chaldeans from Iraq, as well as Coptic Christians from Egypt and Sudan. According to the secretary-general of the Syriac League, approximately 10,000 Iraqi Christians and 3,000 to 4,000 Coptic Christians reside in the country.

|A U.S. government source estimates the population is 3.9 million. According to the 2008 National Population and Housing Census, the population is 85.6 percent Christian, 12.2 percent Muslim, 0.6 percent adherents of indigenous religious beliefs, 1.5 percent persons who claim no religion, and less than 1 percent members of other religious groups, including Bahá'ís, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists. The estimated percentage of the Muslim population is a source of contention. Unofficial reports and surveys estimate Muslims constitute between 10 and 20 percent of the population. Many members of religious groups incorporate elements of indigenous beliefs into their religious practices. Christian groups include Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and members of the United Methodist, African Methodist Episcopal (AME), AME Zion, and a variety of Pentecostal churches.
Christians reside throughout the country. Muslims belong mainly to the Mandingo ethnic group, which resides throughout the country, and the Vai ethnic group, which lives predominantly in the west. There is also a predominantly Muslim Fula community throughout the country. The Fula people are referred to as a community not by location, but as a tribal segment of society. Ethnic groups in most regions participate in the indigenous religious practices of secret societies.

The Ukrainian embassy in Tripoli also maintains a small Orthodox church for Tripoli's Russian-speaking population. There are nondenominational, evangelical Unity churches in Tripoli and Benghazi, as well as small Unity congregations located throughout the country. Nondenominational churches in Tripoli serve primarily African and Filipino migrant workers. The overwhelming majority of Libya's Jewish population, estimated at 40,000, fled the country between 1948 and 1967. David Gerbi, a Libyan Jew active in the exiled Jewish community in Italy, estimates that there are around 200,000 Libyan Jews and their descendants living outside of the country. While there are reports of some Jews remaining, there are no known estimates of the current population. Representatives from the Jewish diaspora are unable to return to reopen the synagogue in Tripoli due to security concerns.
There are no known places of worship for members of other non-Muslim religious groups, although adherents are allowed to practice their religion in their homes.

|The country's population is 32.3 million, according to U.S. government estimates. More than 99 percent is Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, Shia Muslims, and Bahá'ís. According to Jewish community leaders, there are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Jews, approximately 2,500 of whom reside in Casablanca and are the remnants of a much larger community that has mostly emigrated. The Rabat and Marrakesh Jewish communities each have about 100 members. The remainder of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the country. That population is mostly elderly.
The predominantly Roman Catholic and Protestant foreign resident Christian community consists of approximately 5,000 practicing members, although some Protestant and Catholic clergy estimate the number to be as high as 25,000. Most foreign resident Christians live in the Casablanca, Tangier, and Rabat urban areas. Various local Christian leaders estimate that there are 4,000 citizen Christians (mostly ethnic Amazigh) who regularly attend "house" churches and live predominantly in the south. Some Christian leaders estimate that there may be as many as 8,000 Christian citizens throughout the country, but many reportedly do not meet regularly due to fear of government surveillance and social persecution.
The Catholic and French Protestant (referred to as l’Eglise evangelique du Maroc, or EEM) churches have buildings throughout many cities in the country. There are two Anglican churches located in Casablanca and Tangier. The Russian Orthodox Church holds services in a building in Rabat. The Greek Orthodox Church owns a building in Casablanca where it holds services. The Association Marocaine des Eglises Protestantes (AMEP) churches, a network of autonomous foreign resident Protestant church communities, generally rent or share buildings.
There are an estimated 3,000 to 8,000 Shia Muslims, most of them foreign residents from Lebanon or Iraq but including a few citizens. Followers of several Sufi Muslim orders across the Maghreb and West Africa undertake joint annual pilgrimages to the country. There are 350-400 Bahá'ís, located in urban areas.

The 2007 census estimates that 28 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, 27 percent is Protestant, 18 percent is Muslim, 9 percent is divided among many small groups, and approximately 18 percent does not profess a religion or belief. Religious leaders speculate that a significant portion of the population adheres to syncretic indigenous religious beliefs, a category not included in the 2007 census. Muslim leaders state that their community accounts for closer to 25-30 percent of the population, a statistic frequently reported in the press. There are small numbers of Jews, Hindus, and Bahá'ís.
The South Asian immigrant population is predominantly Muslim, and there are some differences between their practices and the traditional, Sufi-inspired Swahili Islam of Muslims of African origin. An increasing number of African Muslim clerics travel to Egypt, Kuwait, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia for training, and some return with a more conservative approach to Islam.

The National Churches Fellowship of Nepal reported that more than 1,000 Christian churches operate in the country. Christian groups state that the number of Christians increased significantly over the past several years, as borne out by the community's nearly three-fold increase over the past decade, from 0.5 to 1.4 percent of the total population. According to a Jamia Masjid (mosque) official, there are at least 3,600 madrassahs, most of which are associated with a mosque.

Evangelical leaders discount these figures, claiming larger percentages of the population.
The Assemblies of God, Nicaragua's largest evangelical Pentecostal church, estimates its membership at 640,000. Evangelical leaders estimate evangelicals currently represent 43-46 percent of the population; they include Moravian Lutherans, Baptists, and other Protestants in that number.

|The 2011 census estimates the population to be 51.8 million. The census did not include statistics on religious demography. According to 2001 census figures, 80 percent of the population is Christian. Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and adherents of traditional African beliefs together constitute slightly less than 5 percent of the population. Approximately 15 percent of the population adheres to no particular religion or declines to indicate an affiliation; some of these individuals probably adhere to unaffiliated indigenous religions. Many combine Christian and indigenous religious practices. The Church of Scientology has a small following.
The African Independent Churches constitute the largest group of Christian churches, including the Zion Christian Church (approximately 11 percent of the population), the Apostolic Church (approximately 10 percent), and a number of Pentecostal and charismatic groups. Other Christian groups include Methodists, Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, and members of the Greek Orthodox, Dutch Reformed, and Congregational churches.
Ethnic Indian/Asian South Africans account for 2.5 percent of the total population. Roughly half of the ethnic Indian population is Hindu, and the majority resides in KwaZulu-Natal. The small Muslim community includes Cape Malays of Malayan-Indonesian descent, individuals of Indian or Pakistani origin, and several thousand Somali and Ethiopian immigrants.
The small Jewish community is concentrated in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

|According to the 2008 census, the population is approximately 8 million. The majority is Christian. There are no reliable statistics on the Muslim or animist minorities. Studies from the 1980s and the early 2000s estimated that Muslims constituted between 18 and 35 percent of the population, but the number of Muslims has probably declined through migration to Sudan after South Sudanese independence in 2011. The acting general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches, which continues to include churches in both Sudan and South Sudan, notes that the seven principal Christian groups are Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Sudan Pentecostal, Sudan Interior, Presbyterian Evangelical, and the Inland African Church. A substantial part of the population in isolated parts of the country probably adheres to indigenous religious beliefs or combines Christian and indigenous practices.

|The population is approximately 26 million, according to the 2008 census. The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Almost all Muslims are Sunni, although there are significant distinctions between followers of different Sunni traditions, particularly among Sufi orders. In addition, there are small Muslim minorities, including Shia and the Republican Brothers, based predominantly in Khartoum, and a growing, yet still small, percentage of Salafists.
The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that Christians make up 3 percent of the population. Christians primarily reside in Khartoum, the north, and the Nuba Mountains. It is unclear whether these numbers include residents of Southern Sudanese origin whose citizenship status remains under review. Khartoum's significant Christian population decreased with the migration of many Christians of southern heritage to South Sudan.
There are very small but long-established groups of Orthodox Christians in Khartoum and other cities, including Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox. There are also Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox communities, largely made up of refugees and migrants, in Khartoum and the east. Other smaller Christian groups include the Africa Inland Church, Armenian (Apostolic) Church, Sudan Church of Christ, Sudan Interior Church, Sudan Pentecostal Church, Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Church of the Sudan, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Anglicans, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
The Culture and Information Ministry indicates that less than 1 percent of the population adheres to African traditional religious beliefs. Some Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of traditional beliefs.

|According to a 2011 World Bank estimate, the population is 530,000. Approximately 41 percent of the population is Christian, of which half are Roman Catholics, according to the 2004 census. A wide range of other groups, including Moravian, Lutheran, Dutch Reformed, evangelical Protestant, Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), make up the remaining Christian population. Twenty percent of the population is Hindu, including the Sanathan Dharma and the Arya Dewaker. Muslims, including Sunni, Ahmadiyya, and the World Islamic Call Society, make up 13.5 percent. Approximately 3 percent adhere to indigenous religions. Bahá'ís, Jews, Buddhists, Brahma Kumaris, and Hare Krishnas are also present in small numbers. There are three Rastafarian organizations: Aya Bingi Order, 12th Tribe, and Bobo Shanti.
Some Amerindian and Maroon populations adhere to indigenous religions. Some Amerindians, concentrated principally in the interior and to a lesser extent in coastal areas, practice shamanism through a medicine man (piaiman). Many Maroons, who inhabit the interior, worship nature through a practice that has no special name. Other Maroons, as well as some Creoles in urban areas, worship their ancestors through a rite called wintie. Citizens of Amerindian and Maroon origin who identify as Christian often combine Christian practices with indigenous religious customs with the tacit approval of Christian leaders.
There is a correlation between ethnicity and religion. Many political parties have strong ethnic ties, and members tend to belong to the same religious group. With the exception of those following indigenous practices, religious groups are not concentrated in any particular region.

Membership in the Church of Sweden has decreased steadily since it separated from the state in 2000. Researchers estimate that approximately 6 percent of the population is Muslim.
According to the Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities, the number of Jews is approximately 20,000. The Swedish Commission for Government Support to Faith Communities estimates there are 9,000 practicing Jews in the country. Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform synagogues are found mostly in large cities.

The June update of the 2010 census estimates religious group membership as 38.6 percent Roman Catholic, 28 percent Protestant, 4.5 percent Muslim, and 1.8 percent Christian Orthodox. Over 20 percent self-identifies as atheist. Religious groups constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Old Catholics, other Christian denominations, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jews. Although actual church attendance rates are much lower, 80 percent report being religious, including 22 percent being very religious, in a 2007 Religion Monitor survey sponsored by the Bertelsmann Foundation.
Most immigrants are members of religious groups different from native-born citizens. Over 90 percent of Muslims are of foreign origin, with nearly 100 nationalities represented. Most come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania, Turkey, and North Africa. The majority of the Muslim community is Sunni, interspersed with some Shia and Alawites. Most of the Muslim population lives in urban areas. Over 75 percent of Jewish households are located in Zurich, Geneva, Basel, and Bern.

|Christian 5.2%, Muslim 92.8%, Atheist 0.1%, Agnostic 1.9%
|According to a U.S. government source, the population is approximately 22.5 million, although emigration increased throughout the year due to ongoing violence, unrest, and economic hardship. Sunni Muslims constitute 74 percent of the population and are present throughout the country. The Sunni population includes Arabs, Kurds, Circassians, Chechens, and some Turkomans. Other Muslim groups, including Alawis, Ismailis, and Shia, together constitute 13 percent. Druze account for 3 percent of the population. Various Christian groups constitute the remaining 10 percent, although the Christian population may be closer to 8 percent due to emigration as Christians flee the country. There is also a small Jewish population in major urban areas.
Most Christians belong to the autonomous Orthodox churches, the Uniate churches (which recognize the Roman Catholic Pope), or the independent Nestorian Church. There is a Yezidi population of approximately 80,000, but the government does not recognize the Yezidi as belonging to a group distinct from Islam. Many of the approximately 100 Jews in the country at the beginning of the year have reportedly emigrated due to the ongoing conflict.
Most Christians live in and around Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Latakia, or in the Hasaka governorate in the northeast section of the country. Iraqi Christians frequently migrated to Syria in past years, but very few entered during the year due to ongoing unrest and violence. The majority of the Iraqi Christian population in the country either moved to neighboring states or returned to Iraq. The majority of Alawis live in the mountainous areas of the coastal Latakia governorate, but they also have significant presence in the cities of Latakia, Tartous, Homs, and Damascus. Many Druze live in the rugged Jabal al-Arab region in the southern governorate of Suweida, where they constitute the vast majority of the local population. The few remaining Jews are concentrated in Damascus and Aleppo. Yezidis are found primarily in the northeast and Aleppo. The Kurdish population is located in the northern and eastern border areas with Turkey and Iraq, largely in Hassakeh, Raqqah, and Halab.

|According to Ministry of Interior figures from October, the population is 23,293,600. Based on a comprehensive study conducted in 2005, the Religious Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) estimates that 35 percent of the population considers itself to be Buddhist and 33 percent Taoist. Although MOI has not tracked data on religious adherence since the 2005 study, it states this estimate might still reflect the situation. MOI does not include religious adherence as a census question, as doing so would constitute an invasion of privacy according to the Personal Data Protection Law. While the overwhelming majority of religious adherents categorize themselves as either Buddhist or Taoist, many adherents consider themselves to be both Buddhist and Taoist.
In addition to organized religious groups, many persons also practice traditional Chinese folk religions, which include some aspects of shamanism, ancestor worship, and animism. Researchers and academics estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population believes in some form of traditional folk religion. Such folk religions may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or other traditional Chinese religions. There also may be an overlap between practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions, and Falun Gong practitioners. Falun Gong is a self-described spiritual discipline that combines qigong (a traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi. Falun Gong is registered as a civic rather than a religious organization. According to an academic source, Falun Gong membership exceeds one million and continues to grow.
Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include I Kuan Tao, Tien Ti Chiao (Heaven Emperor Religion), Tien Te Chiao (Heaven Virtue Religion), Li-ism, Hsuan Yuan Chiao (Yellow Emperor Religion), Tian Li Chiao (Tenrikyo), Universe Maitreya Emperor Religion, Hai Tze Tao, Zhonghua Sheng Chiao (Chinese Holy Religion), Da Yi Chiao (Great Changes Religion), Pre-cosmic Salvationism, Huang Chung Chiao (Yellow Middle Religion), Roman Catholicism, Islam, the Church of Scientology, the Bahá'í Faith, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mahikari Religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and the Unification Church, all of which are registered. Unregistered denominations include the Presbyterian, True Jesus, Baptist, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, and Episcopal churches. The majority of the indigenous population of 507,000 aborigines is Protestant or Roman Catholic. Jews number approximately 130 persons, although they are predominantly foreign residents. Some 400,000 migrant workers, primarily from Southeast Asia, differ in religious adherence from the general population. The largest single group of migrant workers is from Indonesia, with a population of more than 200,000 persons who are largely Muslim. Migrant workers from the Philippines are predominantly Christian.

|The population is 7.7 million, according to a State Statistics Agency estimate from October 2011. According to local academics, the population is more than 90 percent Muslim. Active observance of Islam appears to be increasing steadily, especially among youth. The majority adhere to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam as traditionally practiced in Central Asia. Approximately 4 percent of Muslims are Ismaili Shia, the majority of whom reside in the remote eastern Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The country has approximately 3,452 "five-time" prayer mosques and 357 "Friday prayer" mosques (larger facilities built for weekly prayers).
There are 75 registered non-Muslim religious groups. There are approximately 150,000 Christians. The largest Christian group is Russian Orthodox; there are also Baptists, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans, and Korean Protestants. There are a small number of Bahá'ís, fewer than 300 Jews and approximately 700 Jehovah's Witnesses.

|The National Bureau of Statistics estimates the population is nearly 45 million. The government does not collect data on religious identification. The Interfaith Council (also known as the Inter-Religious Council for Peace Tanzania, a nongovernmental organization bringing together Christian, Muslim, Bahá'í, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders to foster peace and strengthen relationships) does not keep statistics on religious identity. Many religious groups are reluctant to estimate religious demographics, but most religious leaders estimate that the population is 50 percent Christian and 50 percent Muslim. A 2010 Pew Forum survey estimates that approximately 60 percent of the population is Christian, 36 percent Muslim, and 4 percent members of other religious groups.
On the mainland, large Muslim communities are concentrated in coastal areas, with some large Muslim minorities also located inland in urban areas. Zanzibar is approximately 98 percent Muslim. Between 80 and 90 percent of the Muslim population is Sunni. The remainder consists of several Shia subgroups, mostly of Asian descent. Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Protestants (including Pentecostals), Seventh-day Adventists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Jehovah's Witnesses. Other religious groups include Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, and Bahá'ís.
The country's three largest political parties are secular, but include the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) party, often associated with Zanzibar's Muslim community, and the opposition Chama cha Mapinduzi na Maendeleo (Chadema) party, often associated with the Christian majority on the mainland.

|According to the 2010 census, the population of 66 million is 93 percent Buddhist and 5 percent Muslim. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and religious groups claim that 85 to 95 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist and 5 to 10 percent is Muslim. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include animist, Christian, Confucian, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Taoist populations.
Theravada Buddhism, the dominant religion, is not an exclusive belief system and most Buddhists also incorporate Brahmin-Hindu and animist practices. The Buddhist clergy (Sangha) consists of two main schools: Mahanikaya and Dhammayuttika. The former is older and more prevalent within the monastic community than the latter. The same ecclesiastical hierarchy governs both groups.
Islam is the dominant religion in four of the five southernmost provinces. The majority of Muslims in those provinces are ethnic Malay, but the Muslim population nationally also includes descendants of immigrants from South Asia, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and those who consider themselves ethnic Thai. The Ministry of Interior's Islamic Affairs Section reported that, as of October, 3,744 mosques are registered in 68 of the country's 77 provinces, of which 3,179 are located in the 14 southern provinces. According to the Religious Affairs Department (RAD) of the Ministry of Culture, 99 percent of these mosques are associated with the Sunni branch of Islam. Shia mosques make up 1 percent and are in Bangkok and the provinces of Nakhon Sithammarat, Krabi, and Phatthalung. There are 39 Provincial Islamic Committees nationwide.
The majority of ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese practice Mahayana or Theravada Buddhism. Many ethnic Chinese, as well as members of the Mien hill tribe, practice forms of Taoism.

Reliable figures are difficult to obtain because of migration and because the government does not collect religious and ethnic data.
Most Muslims live in the central and northern regions. Christians live mainly in the southern part of the country. The Muslim Union of Togo reports a large surge in immigrants from Muslim countries, but the government does not collect the statistics needed to confirm or deny that claim.

Cao Dai, a religion combining elements of many religions, is practiced by 2.5 to 4 percent of the population. Hoa Hao followers constitute 1.5 to 3 percent of the population. Estimates of the number of Protestants range from 1 to 2 percent of the population. Some Protestant denominations are officially recognized at the national level; others are registered locally, but have not attained national recognition. Muslims number 70,000 to 80,000, or less than 0.1 percent of the population; approximately 40 percent of Muslims are Sunnis; the remaining 60 percent practice Bani Islam.
Smaller religious groups that together comprise less than 0.1 percent of the population include 50,000 ethnic Cham who mostly practice a devotional form of Hinduism in the south-central coastal area, an estimated 8,000 members of the Bahá'í Faith, and approximately 1,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) throughout the country. There is one Jewish synagogue in Ho Chi Minh City serving approximately 150 Jews, mainly foreign residents who live in the city.
Other citizens consider themselves nonreligious, or practice animism or the veneration of ancestors, tutelary and protective saints, national heroes and local, respected persons. Followers of these traditional forms of worship may or may not term themselves religious.
Ethnic minorities constitute approximately 14 percent of the population. Based on adherents’ estimates, two-thirds of Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, including minority groups in the Northwest Highlands (H’mong, Dzao, Thai, and others) and in the Central Highlands (Ede, Jarai, Sedang, and M’nong, among others). The Khmer Krom ethnic group overwhelmingly practices Theravada Buddhism.

There are reports of an increase in Muslims who adhere to Salafi-Sunni Islam, but statistics are unavailable to confirm these reports. There are a few thousand Ismaili Muslims concentrated in the Haraz district near Sanaa, an unknown number of Ithnasheria (Twelver) Shia who reside mainly in the north, and a significant but indeterminate number of Sufis. Groups comprising less than .05 percent of the population include Jews, Bahá'ís, Hindus, and Christians, many of whom are refugees or temporary foreign residents. Christian groups include Roman Catholics and Anglicans. The once-sizable Jewish community is the only indigenous non-Muslim minority religious group; the few Jews remaining after decades of emigration to Israel live mainly in Sanaa and the Rayda district in the Amran governorate.

|Preliminary findings from the 2012 national census estimate the population at 13 million, although it is likely lower because an estimated three to four million Zimbabweans currently live outside the country due to economic and political crises. According to the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), 84 percent of the population is Christian. The EFZ's 2004 census estimates the Christian population is 33 percent Catholic; 42 percent evangelical or Pentecostal; 17 percent Anglican, Methodist, or Presbyterian, and 8 percent apostolic. There are a significant number of independent Pentecostal and syncretic African churches.
The majority of the population also adheres to indigenous religions. Religious leaders reported a continued increase in observance of indigenous religious practices, often simultaneously with Christianity. Approximately 14 percent of the population adheres solely to indigenous religious beliefs.
Approximately 3 percent of the population is Muslim, primarily immigrants of Mozambican and Malawian descent. The Muslim population is concentrated in rural areas and in some high-density suburbs. Small numbers of Greek Orthodox, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Bahá'ís make up less than 1 percent of the population.
Political elites tend to be members of established Christian mainstream or Pentecostal churches. Some apostolic groups, along with the CPZ, support the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and are especially prevalent in ZANU-PF political strongholds.

{{Paranormal}}

A '''shadow person''' (also known as a '''shadow figure''', '''shadow being''' or '''black mass''') is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] as the presence of a spirit or other entity.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahlquist|first=Diane|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Life After Death|year=2007|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|location=USA|isbn=978-1-59257-651-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lkscwxGSoAC&amp;pg=PA122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and folklore==
A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or [[supernatural]] entities such as [[Shade (mythology)|shades]] of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.

The ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' late night radio talk show helped popularize modern beliefs in shadow people.&lt;ref name="Kinsella2011" /&gt; The first time the topic of shadow people was discussed at length on the show was April 12, 2001 when host Art Bell interviewed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] elder Thunder Strikes, who is also known as Harley "SwiftDeer" Reagan. During the show, listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people that they had seen and a large number of these drawings were immediately shared publicly on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|title=Art Bell - Shadow People|archivedate=September 25, 2001|url=http://artbell.com/shadows.html|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010925192530/http://www.artbell.com/shadows.html|accessdate=3 October 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, Heidi Hollis published her first book on the topic of shadow people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heidi Hollis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyAXPQAACAAJ |title=The Secret War: The Heavens Speak of the Battle |publisher=iUniverse |date=October 1, 2001 |isbn=9780595203314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became a regular guest on ''Coast to Coast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Heidi Hollis - Guests|url = http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/hollis-heidi/5884|website = Coast to Coast AM|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollis describes shadow people as dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision, and claims that people have reported the figures attempting to "jump on their chest and choke them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2008/07/23 | title=Shadow People &amp; the "Hat Man" | publisher=Coast to Coast AM | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the figures to be negative, alien beings that can be repelled by various means, including invoking "the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Name of Jesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2006/03/27 | title=Shadow Beings | publisher=Coast to Coast | date=2006-03-27 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to [[paranormal]] and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe.&lt;ref name="Kinsella2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kinsella|title=Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBK8Nr4edm4C&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=17 May 2011|publisher=Univ.

Shadow people feature in two episodes of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] paranormal documentary series ''[[Extreme Ghost Stories]]'', where the phenomenon is described as a "black mass".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Extreme Ghost Stories]]''. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 2006. Episodes 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanations==
Several [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A [[sleep paralysis]] sufferer may perceive a "shadowy or indistinct shape" approaching them when they lie awake paralyzed and become increasingly alarmed.&lt;ref name="Adler2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelley Adler|title=Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, and the Mind-Body Connection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t63WJiZb3cC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=15 January 2011|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-5237-8|pages=3–|quote=''In the field of sleep research, this experience is termed sleep paralysis: an individual, in the process of falling asleep or awakening, finds himself or herself completely awake, but unable to move or speak…Frequently, he or she sees a shadowy or indistinct shape approaching and becomes increasingly terrified.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroscientists Baland Jalal and [[Vilayanur S.

The concept of the '''supernatural''' proposes that something cannot be explained by scientific understanding or the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Examples often include characteristics of or relating to entities and concepts such as [[ghost]]s, [[angel]]s, [[gods]], [[souls]] and [[spirit]]s, [[non-physical entity|non-material being]]s, or anything else considered ''beyond'' nature like [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[miracle]]s.

Over time, things once thought to be supernatural such as [[lightning]], [[seasons]], and [[human senses]] have been shown to have entirely naturalistic explanations and origins. Some believe that which is considered supernatural will someday be discovered to be completely physical and natural. Those who believe only the physical world exists are called [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]]. Those who believe similarly often maintain skeptical attitudes and beliefs concerning supernatural concepts. Belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Halman 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.2: Gloabal Expressions|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313351839|editor=Phil Zuckerman|chapter=8. Atheism And Secularity In The Netherlands|quote="Thus, despite the fact that they claim to be convinced atheists and the majority deny the existence of a personal god, a rather large minority of the Dutch convinced atheists believe in a supernatural power!" (e.g. telepathy, reincarnation, life after death, and heaven)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supernatural is featured in [[paranormal]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[religion|religious]] contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pasulka |first1=Diana |last2=Kripal |first2=Jeffrey |title=Religion and the Paranormal |url=https://blog.oup.com/2014/11/religion-supernatural-paranormal/ |website=Oxford University Press blog |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts as well.&lt;ref name="Halman 2010"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Occurring as both an adjective and a noun, descendants of the modern English compound ''supernatural'' enters the language from two sources: By way of Middle French (''supernaturel'') and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (''supernaturalis''). Post-classical Latin ''supernaturalis'' first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix ''super-'' and ''nātūrālis'' (see [[nature]]). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of [[Catherine of Siena]]'s ''[[Dialogue]]'' (''orcherd of Syon'', around 1425; ''Þei haue not þanne þe supernaturel lyȝt ne þe liȝt of kunnynge, bycause þei vndirstoden it not'').&lt;ref name="OED-SUPERNATURAL"&gt;{{Cite OED |supernatural |id=194422 |access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean 'belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal' or 'more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary'. Obsolete uses include 'of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics'. As a noun, the term can mean 'a supernatural being', with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="OED-SUPERNATURAL"/&gt;

==Epistemology and metaphysics==
{{see also|Anthropology of religion}}
The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]], will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected.

One complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of "natural" and the limits of [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in [[religion|religious]] [[spirituality]] and [[occultism]] or [[spiritualism]].

{{quote|For sometimes we use the word ''[[nature]]'' for that ''Author of nature'' whom the [[scholasticism|schoolmen]], harshly enough, call ''[[natura naturans]]'', as when it is said that ''nature'' hath made man partly corporeal and [[Mind-body dualism|partly immaterial]]. Sometimes we mean by the ''nature'' of a thing the ''[[essence]]'', or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the ''[[quiddity]]'' of a thing, namely, the ''[[property (philosophy)|attribute]]'' or ''attributes'' on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be [[matter|corporeal]] or not, as when we attempt to define the ''nature'' of an ''[[angle]]'', or of a ''[[triangle]]'', or of a ''[[fluid]]'' body, as such. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an internal principle of [[motion (physics)|motion]], as when we say that a stone let fall in the [[air (classical element)|air]] is by ''nature'' carried towards the centre of the [[earth (classical element)|earth]], and, on the contrary, that [[fire (classical element)|fire]] or flame does ''naturally'' move upwards toward [[firmament|heaven]]. Sometimes we understand by ''nature'' the established course of things, as when we say that ''nature'' makes the [[night]] succeed the [[day]], ''nature'' hath made [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] necessary to the [[life]] of men. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an [[physiology|aggregate of powers]] belonging to a body, especially a living one, as when [[physician]]s say that ''nature'' is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such [[disease]]s ''nature'' left to herself [[immune system|will do the cure]]. Sometimes we take nature for the [[universe]], or system of the corporeal works of [[God]], as when it is said of a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], or a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], that there is no such thing in ''nature'', i.e. in the world. And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by ''nature'' a [[mother nature|semi-deity]] or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides these more absolute acceptions, if I may so call them, of the word ''nature'', it has divers others (more relative), as ''nature'' is wont to be set or in [[opposite (semantics)|opposition]] or contradistinction to other things, as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a ''[[classical elements|natural motion]]'', but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is ''violent''. So chemists distinguish [[vitriol]] into ''natural'' and ''fictitious'', or made by art, i.e. by the intervention of human power or skill; so it is said that [[water (classical element)|water]], kept suspended in a sucking pump, is not in its ''natural'' place, as that is which is stagnant in the well. We say also that wicked men are still in the state of ''nature'', but the regenerate in a state of ''[[divine grace|grace]]''; that cures wrought by [[medicine]]s are natural operations; but the [[miraculous]] ones wrought by [[Christ]] and his [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]]s were ''supernatural''.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "supernatural" is often used interchangeably with [[paranormal]] or [[preternatural]]&amp;nbsp;— the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=znMqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22&amp;dq=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22 |title=The paranormal |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=July 26, 2010|isbn=9780824210922 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, ''ex hypothesi,'' violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are [[Philosophical realism|realistically accountable]].

Many supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the [[universe]] cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained.

Views on the "supernatural" vary, for example it may be seen as:

* '''indistinct from nature'''. From this perspective, some events occur according to the [[Natural law|laws of nature]], and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature. For example, in Scholasticism, it was believed that God was capable of performing any miracle so long as it didn't lead to a logical [[contradiction]]. Some religions posit immanent deities, however, and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural; some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will ([[occasionalism]]), in the mind ([[neoplatonism]]), or as a part ([[nondualism]]) of a more fundamental divine reality ([[platonism]]).
* '''incorrect human attribution'''. In this view all events have natural and only natural causes. They believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events, such as [[lightning]], [[rainbow]]s, [[flood]]s, and the [[origin of life]].&lt;ref name="Zhong1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zhong Yang Yan Jiu Yuan |author2=Min Tsu Hsüeh Yen Chiu So |year=1976 |title=Bulletin of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Issues 42–44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyQZAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.J. |last=Ellis |first2=D.F. |last2=Bjorklund |year=2004 |title=Origins of the Social Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development |publisher=Guilford Publications |isbn=9781593851033 |lccn=2004022693 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UjiZwYGdFoC&amp;pg=PA413 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
Dialogues from [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic philosophy]] in the third century AD contributed the development of the concept the supernatural via [[Christian theology]] in later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"The eventual development of a clear concept of the supernatural in Christian theology was promoted both by dialogues with heretics and by the influence of Neoplatonic philosophy."

In the medieval period, "nature" had ten different meanings and "natural" had eleven different meanings.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartlett |first1=Robert |title=The Natural and the Supernatural in the Middle Ages |date=14 March 2008 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=d9O3PtKMPNsC&amp;pg=PA1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521702550 |chapter=1. The Boundaries of the Supernatural |pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Lombard]], a medieval scholastic in the 12th century, asked about causes that are beyond nature, in that how there could be causes that were God's alone. He used the term ''praeter naturam'' in his writings.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; In the scholastic period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] classified miracles into three categories: "above nature", "beyond nature", and "against nature". In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Thomas's important contribution to the emergence of a technical theology of the supernatural represents a special development of the concept of surpassing effects. Saint Thomas and others of the Scholastics have left us as one of their legacies a dichotomy between the natural and the supernatural that is theologically rooted in the distinction between the Order of Nature and the Order of Grace."

'''Tattvartha Sutra''' (also known as '''Tattvarth-adhigama-sutra''') is an ancient [[Jain text]] written by ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]]'' [[Umaswati]], sometime between the 2nd- and 5th-century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-TattvrthaStra.html|title=Tattvārtha Sūtra|work=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=86}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|editor=Patrick Olivelle|title=Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977507-1|pages=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the one of the Jain scripture written in the [[Sanskrit]] language.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=vi}} ''Tattvartha Sutra'' is also known in [[Jainism]] as the ''Moksha-shastra'' (Scripture describing the path of liberation).

The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative text in Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the ''[[Digambara]]'' and ''[[Śvētāmbara]]'' sects. Its importance in Jainism is comparable with that of the [[Brahma Sutras]] and [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] in [[Hinduism]]. It is a text in [[sutra]] or aphorisms, and presents the complete Jainism philosophy in 350 sutras over 10 chapters.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. V.

One of its sutras, ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam]]'' is the motto of Jainism. Its meaning is interpreted as "(The function) of souls is to help one another",{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=72}} or "Souls render service to one another".{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=131}}

The next three chapters deal with the ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and their manifestations and the influx, ''[[asrava]]'', good and bad ''karma'', ''shubha-ashubha karma'' and the [[Bandha (Jainism)|bondage of the karmas]]. The ninth chapter describes the blocking, ''[[samvara]]'' and shedding of the karmas, ''[[nirjara]]''. The final chapter discusses ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' or the liberation of the soul.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}

===Seven categories of truth===
The theology in ''Tattvartha Sutra'' presents seven categories of truth in sutra 1.4:{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xviii-xx, 2-3, 6}}
#Souls exist ([[Jīva (Jainism)|Jeeva]])
#Non-sentient matter exists ([[Ajiva|Ajeeva]])
#Karmic particles exist that inflow to each soul ([[Asrava|Aasrava]])
#Karmic particles bind to the soul {which transmigrate with rebirth} ([[Bandha (Jainism)|Band]]) 
#Karmic particles inflow can be stopped ([[Samvara|Samvar]])
#Karmic particles can fall away from soul ([[Nirjara]])
#Complete release of karmic particles leads to liberation from worldly bondage ([[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]])

Umaswami categorizes the types of knowledge to be empirical, attained through one's sense of perception. He adds that knowledge is also acquired through literature, clairvoyance, and omniscience.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=12-15}} In chapter 2, Umaswati presents sutras on soul. He asserts that soul is distinguished by suppression of deluding karma, or elimination of eight types of karmas, or partial presence of destructive karmas, or arising of eight types of new karmas, or those that are innate to the soul, or a combination of these.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=33-62}} In chapter 3 through 6, Umaswati presents sutras for his first three categories of truth.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=7-168}}

===Ethics===
{{Main|Ethics in Jainism}}
In chapter 7, Umaswati presents the Jaina vows and explains their value in stopping karmic particle inflow to the soul. The vows, with their respective translations by Nathmal Tatia, are 
:*''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (abstinence from violence)
:* ''[[Satya|anirta]]'' (abstinence from falsehood)
:* ''[[asteya]]'' (abstinence from stealing)
:* ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (abstinence from carnality), and
:* ''[[aparigraha]]'' (abstinence from possessiveness).{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=169-170}}

===Karma and rebirths===
{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}
Umaswati, in chapter 8 of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' presents his sutras on how [[karma]] affects rebirths. He asserts that accumulated karma in life determines the length of life and realm of rebirth for each soul in each of four states – infernal beings, plants and animals, human beings and as gods.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=195-199}}{{Sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=118-119}} Further, states Umaswati, karma also affects the body, the shape, the characteristics as well as the status of the soul within the same species, such as ''Ucchi'' (upper) or ''Nicchi'' (lower) status.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=195-199}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=118-119}} The accumulated and new karma are material particles, states Umaswati, which stick to the soul and these travel with the soul from one life to the next as bondage, where each ripens.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=200-203}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=121-124}} Once ripened, the karmic particles fall off, states Umaswati.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=200-203}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=121-124}}

===Shedding karma and liberation===
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)}}
The chapter 9 of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' states how karmic particles can be stopped from attaching to the soul and how these can be shed.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=213-248}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}} Umaswati asserts that ''gupti'' (curbing activity), ''[[dharma]]'' (virtues such as forbearance, modesty, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation), contemplation, endurance in hardship (he lists twenty two hardships including hunger, thirst, cold, heat, nakedness, injury, lack of gain, illness, praise, disrespect), and with good character towards others (he lists five – equanimity, reinitiation, non-injury ([[Ahimsa]]), slight passion and fair conduct), a soul stops karmic accumulations.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}} External austerities such as fasting, reduced diet and isolated habitation, along with internal austerities such as expiation, reverence, service, renunciation and meditation, according to Umaswati, along with respectful service to teachers and ailing ascetics help shed karma.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}}

The state of liberation is presented in Chapter 10 by Umaswati.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=250-263}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}} It is achieved when deluding and obstructive karmas have been destroyed.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=250-263}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}} This leads to the state of quietism and potentiality, and the soul then moves to the end of the universe, states Umaswati.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}}

==Importance==
The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative book on [[Jainism]], and the only text authoritative in both the [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]] sects,{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=16-17}}.

== Commentaries and Translations ==

=== Commentaries ===
The Tattvartha Sutra has the largest number of Jaina [[bhashya]]s or commentaries in different Indian languages from the fifth century onward. The total number of commentaries and translations of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' goes beyond 25.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=48}}

The most famous and oldest commentary on the ''Tattvārthasūtra'' is ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' of ''Ācārya [[Pujyapada]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnxjAAAAMAAJ|title=Prolegomena to Prakritica et Jainica|author1=Banerjee|first1=Satya Ranjan|year=2005|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=}} (sixth century CE). ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' along with [[Akalanka]]'s c. 780 CE ''Rajavartika'' and Vijayananda's ''Slokavarttika'' (9th century) form the central texts of Digambara monastic students.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}

===Translations===
The text is in ''sutra'' form. The word ''Sutra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: सूत्र) means "string, thread".&lt;ref name=winternitz249&gt;M Winternitz (2010 Reprint), A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}, pages 249&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word is ''siv'', that which sews and holds things together.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssutra&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Entry for [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1200/mw__1274.html ''Sutra''], page 1241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGregor|first=Geddes|title=Dictionary of Religion and Philosophy|year=1989|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|isbn=1557780196|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Indian literature, ''Sutra'' means a distilled collection of syllables and words, any form or manual of "aphorism, rule, direction" hanging together like threads with which the "teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge" can be woven.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssutra/&gt;&lt;ref name=winternitz249/&gt;

The distilled nature of sutra texts leave them open to varying interpretations. The Tattvartha sutra have been variously translated. The first verse of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' has been translated as follows, for example:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
"The enlightened [[Darśana|darsana]] (world view), enlightened knowledge and enlightened conduct are the path to liberation" – Translated by Nathmal Tatia{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=5-6}}

"Right faith, right knowledge and right conduct constitute the path to liberation" – Translated by Vijay Jain{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Umaswati, ''Tattvartha Sutra'' 1.1}}

The text has been translated into many languages including English and German, latest being English translation in 1993.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=48}}

'''''The Heathen's Guide to World Religions''''' is a book by Kingston, Ontario-based William Hopper (1966-2017). It is a humorous look at the history of the [[Jewish]], [[Christian]], [[Islamic]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] faiths.

The book was written in 1997, and self-published by Hopper that same year. After attracting the attention of publishers, it was re-released in 2001 by StoneFox Publishing. After StoneFox went defunct in 2003, the rights to the book reverted to the author. In 2005, Hopper founded [[Diogenes Press]], publishing a new, expanded edition of ''The Heathen's Guide to World Religions''. In 2008, Hopper worked with [[Eris Publications]] to produce the current "New World Order" edition. The most recent edition was published in 2011.

The '''Tony Blair Faith Foundation''' was an [[Interfaith dialog|interfaith]] [[charitable foundation]] established in May 2008 by former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]]. Since December 2016 its work has been continued by the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]].&lt;ref name=G30/&gt;

==Launch==
The Foundation was launched in May 2008 in New York at the headquarters of the media group [[Time Warner]]. In his speech, Blair outlined the Foundation's aim that "idealism becomes the new realism", and that one of its goals was to "counter extremism in all six leading religions" (i.e., according to the Foundation, [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]]). Blair said that while in office, he feared being exposed as a "nutter" if he had talked about his religious views. Former US president [[Bill Clinton]] attended the launch, describing Blair as "a good man as well as a great leader". In an interview with [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]], Blair said the Foundation was "how I want to spend the rest of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm  "BBC News Blair launches faith foundation"], bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation listed several goals: "The foundation provides the practical support required to help prevent religious prejudice, conflict and extremism. At school, university and professional level the foundation provides various education programmes. The foundation encouraged interfaith initiatives to tackle global poverty and conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1123243&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation's basic premises, as listed in its initial mission statement, were that 1) faith is important to many, underpinning their systems of thought, their behaviour and the behaviour of many of the world's progressive movements, and that 2) the great religions share values of respect, justice and compassion. But the statement also recognised that faith can be divisive, too; this is viewed by the Foundation as being based on distortions of faith rather than being intrinsic to it.

The aim of the Foundation was to use the tools of modern communication to "educate, inform and develop understanding" about various faiths, and the relationships between them. It aimed to do this in such a way as to address [[Poverty|global poverty]] and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html "Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Mission statement"], Tonyblairfaithfoundation.org. Retrieved July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation had several projects: Faith and Globalisation Initiative, Face to Faith (later Generation Global), Faiths Act (an activist group), and Faith Shorts (for short religious films).

===Faith and Globalisation Initiative===
{{main|Faith and Globalisation Initiative}}

Faith and Globalisation Initiative launched in Yale University in September 2008 was an attempt to build a "global conversation" between an "elite group" of universities. As part of this attempt, Blair was to be the [[Howland Memorial Prize|Howland Distinguished Fellow]] at Yale and was one of the professors for the course.&lt;ref name=yale-20080321&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |title=Tony Blair to teach Yale course on faith and globalization |publisher=Yale Bulletin and Calendar |date=21 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418094320/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face to Faith===
Face to Faith was a programme for schoolchildren (12–17 years) which allowed via videoconferencing international interaction where cross-faith discussions may take place. The proclaimed aim was to break down religious and cultural differences and thereby reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/page/about-face-to-faith The Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Face to Faith (Accessed March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faiths Act initiative===
Faiths Act was a project of the Foundation described as an attempt to build a global movement to both "inspire and mobilise" those who believe, in a faith, to address the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The project focused on deaths from [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faithsact.org/about/faiths-act  "Faiths Act"], FaithsAct.org. Retrieved 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith Shorts film project===
The project known as Faith Shorts was announced in March 2010 for short-length movies which increase "understanding between religions".&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb3/&gt;
Awards were presented for the films rated highest.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;

==Directors, executives and advisors==
Angela Salt was the Executive Director of the Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/foundation/leadership|title=Leadership|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was registered as charity in the UK with Tony Blair as its Patron. The trustees were [[Robert Clinton]], [[Robert Coke (investor)|Robert Coke]] and [[Jeremy Sinclair]]. The Foundation was also registered as a charity in the US with the following directors: [[Alfred E. Smith IV]], [[Philip Lader|Linda LeSourd Lader]], Ruth Turner, [[Timothy C. Collins]] and [[Tony Blair]]. [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]], formerly Director of Government Relations within Tony Blair's Prime Ministerial office, was the first Chief Executive.&lt;ref name=TBFwho/&gt;

=== International Religious Advisory Council ===
The Foundation had an International Religious Advisory Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/who-we-are/advisory-council.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222748/http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/who-we-are/advisory-council.html |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of members of what the Foundation considered to be the six major religions.

== Criticism ==
[[Hugh O'Shaughnessy]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the Foundation "inspires ridicule". He noted that Professor [[Michel Schooyans]] of the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] "accused Blair and [[Cherie Blair|his wife]] of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/13/tony-blair-faith-foundation |title=Tony Blair's Faith Foundation inspires ridicule |author=Hugh O'Shaughnessy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant "stripping them of their identity". Schooyans arguing that "(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it. In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession, which a universal, global political power would impose on the entire world."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513/&gt;

The director of the Muslim charity [[Forward Thinking (Charity)|Forward Thinking]], Huda Jawad was reported by the BBC as raising doubts about levels of support from many Muslims for the Foundation, given Blair's foreign-policy record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7994618.stm  "Tony Blair's faith in new mission"], by Christopher Landau, BBC, 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2009, sceptic and secularist [[Richard Dawkins]] mocked the Foundation in a spoof letter, published in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.  In it, Dawkins ridiculed the idea that faith is not a divisive force, and attacked religion's record on promoting dialogue and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2009/04/tony-blair-faith-children|title=The Tony Blair Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2008 and April 2009, the foundation raised more than 3.5 million pounds, and paid, according to the ''Daily Telegraph'', six-figure salaries to its top officials. An implied criticism was that these pay scales were in line with much larger charitable organisations. However, the wages were also reported to be the result of external recommendations and a strategy of hiring a small number of capable senior staff to co-ordinate a variety of efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/7229874/Tony-Blairs-faith-charity-pays-six-figure-salaries-to-top-officials.html "Tony Blair's faith charity pays six figure salaries to top officials"], Robert Mendick, ''The Telegraph'', 13 February 2010.

A former editor of a Foundation website, [[Martin Bright]], was critical of the organisation and its style. He mentioned the problems associated with the need to tiptoe around some of Tony Blair's business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf, his advising of the new government of Egypt being "a nightmare", the organisation's use of "ritzy offices in a West End tower block", the employment of a five-people in a communications department "whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible" and the use of unpaid interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714316/Inside-Blair-s-lair-Five-spin-doctors-ministerial-red-box-town-hall-meetings-doughnuts-deals-dictators-After-THAT-party-Cherie-former-ex-PM-employee-reveals-really-happens.html |title=Inside Blair's lair |newspaper=Mail on Sunday |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20140803&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/03/tony-blair-faith-foundation-charity-martin-bright-role |title=Tony Blair lambasted by former employee over role in own charity |author=Rowena Mason |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wiccan Rede''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|d}} is a statement that provides the key moral system in the [[Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] and certain other related [[Witchcraft]]-based faiths. A common form of the Rede is ''An’ ye harm none, do what ye will''.

The word "Rede" derives from [[Middle English]], meaning "advice" or "counsel" and being closely related to the German {{Lang|de|Rat}} or Scandinavian {{Lang|sv|råd}}. "An" is an [[Archaism|archaic]] Middle English [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], meaning "if." "[[Ye (pronoun)|Ye]]" is an archaic or dialectal form of "you" (nominative plural).

Other variants of the Rede include:
*''Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, An it harm none do what ye will.'' Note: this is the first published form of the couplet, quoted from Doreen Valiente in 1964. Later published versions include "ye" instead of "it" (as the second word, following 'An'): "Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill – An 'ye' harm none, do what ye will" (Earth Religion News, 1974); "wilt" rather than "will": "Eight words  Wiccan Rede fulfill – An' it harm none, do what ye wilt" (Green Egg, 1975); "thou" instead of "ye" or "you", or "as" in place of "what", or any combination, e.g. "...An' (it/ye/you) harm none, do (as/what) (ye/thou/you) (wilt/will)":
*''An it harm none, do what thou wilt''
*''An it harm none, do as thou wilt''
*''That it harm none, do as thou wilt''
*''Do what you will, so long as it harms none''

== History ==
In its best known form as the "eight words" couplet, the Rede was first publicly recorded in a 1964 speech by [[Doreen Valiente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waningmoon.com/ethics/rede3.shtml |title=The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey – Part 3: Eight Words... |author=John J. Coughlin |date= 2 February 2002 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phrase, ''Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law'', appears in [[Aleister Crowley]]'s works by 1904, in [[The Book of the Law]] (though as used by Crowley it is half of a statement and response, the response being "Love is the law, love under will"). According to B.A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, Crowley adopted this line from [[François Rabelais]], who in 1534 wrote, "DO AS THOU WILT because men that are free, of gentle birth, well bred and at home in civiliz&lt;!-- sp. per source --&gt;ed company possess a natural instinct that inclines them to virtue and saves them from vice. This instinct they name their hon&lt;!-- sp. per source --&gt;or".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, B.A. "The Wiccan Rule of Behavior: The Wiccan Rede. ''Origin of the Wiccan Rede:'' Updated: 27 September 2007. Available Online at: [http://www.religioustolerance.org/wicrede.htm Religioustolerance.org], Visited 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Louÿs|King Pausole]], a character in [[Pierre Louÿs]]' ''Les aventures du roi Pausole'' (The Adventures of King Pausole, published in 1901), issued a similar pair of edicts: ''I. — Ne nuis pas à ton voisin. II. — Ceci bien compris, fais ce qu'il te plaît.'' ("Do not harm your neighbor; this being well understood, do that which pleases you.") Although Gardner noted the similarity of the rede to King Pausole's words, [[Silver Ravenwolf]] believes it is more directly referencing Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;RavenWolf, Silver. "Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation." [[Llewellyn Worldwide]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable antecedent was put forth by the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] with his ''[[harm principle]]'' in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. "[[On Liberty]]". 1859. Online copy available at [http://www.utilitarianism.com/ol/one.html Utilitarianism.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; "Mill argues that the sole purpose of law should be to stop people from harming others and that should people want to participate in [[victimless crime]]s, crimes with no complaining witness, such as gambling, drug usage, engaging in prostitution, then they should not be encroached in doing so."{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} In addition, the first part of the phrase is strikingly similar to the Latin maxim [[primum non nocere]] (first do no harm).

===The Long Rede===
In 1974 a complete twenty-six line poem entitled "The Wiccan Rede" was published in the neo-Pagan magazine ''Earth Religion News''. Each line contained a rhymed couplet laid out as a single line, the last line being the familiar "short rede" couplet beginning "Eight words...".

This poem was shortly followed by another, slightly different, version, entitled the "Rede Of The Wiccae", which was published in ''[[Green Egg]]'' magazine by [[Lady Gwen Thompson]]. She ascribed it to her grandmother [[Adriana Porter]], and claimed that the earlier published text was distorted from "its original form". The poem has since been very widely circulated and has appeared in other versions and layouts, with additional or variant passages. It is commonly known as the "Long Rede".

Although Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime. It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed “The Wiccan Verses” were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by [[Doreen Valiente]] at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem ''The Witches Creed'' in her 1978 book, "Witchcraft for Tomorrow", which contains some similar concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, 1978, pages 41, 72-74 (also as noted at The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating the Rede===
According to [[Donald H. Frew|Don Frew]], Valiente composed the couplet, following Gardner's statement that witches "are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, 'Do what you like so long as you harm none'"; he claims the common assumption that the Rede was copied from Crowley is misinformed, and has resulted in the words often being misquoted as "an it harm none, do what thou wilt" instead of "do what you will".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpubs.com/books/mpex_frew.php Excerpt from Interview with Don Frew], ''Modern Pagans'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's attribution of the Long Rede to her grandmother has been disputed, since Adriana Porter died in 1946, well before [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] published ''The Old Laws'', and no evidence for Porter's authorship exists other than Thompson's word. The poem refers to Wiccan concepts that, though ostensibly very old, have not been proven to pre-date the 1940s. Its attribution to Porter may have formed part of Thompson's claim to be an [[hereditary witch]]. Its precise origin has yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waningmoon.com/ethics/rede3.shtml.|title=The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey – Part 3: Eight Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Bott, in an article written in ''White Dragon'' magazine, 2003, argues that the Long Rede's creation can be placed somewhere between 1964 and 1975. Bott bases his argument on the alleged misuse of archaic English in the poem, in particular of " an' " as an abbreviation of "and", and of "ye" instead of "the". Bott states that the author of the poem was evidently unaware that this contraction of "and" is not an archaic, but a modern convention. According to Bott, in the "eight words" couplet originally cited by Valiente, "an" is used correctly, in the Middle English sense of " 'in the event that', or simply 'if' " (as in the Shakespearean "an hadst thou not come to my bed") and thus has no apostrophe. In the poem, this has been transformed into an abbreviated "and" and given an apostrophe, with every "and" in the poem's additional lines then being written " an' " as if to match. Accordingly, Bott concludes that the poem was an attempt to expand Valiente's couplet into a full Wiccan credo, written by someone who misunderstood the archaic language they attempted to imitate.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Bott, 2003. "The Wiccan Rede" in ''White Dragon'' magazine, Lughnasadh 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mathiesen repeats Bott's objection to "ye", but argues that most other archaisms are used correctly. However, he states that they all derive from late 19th century revivalist usages.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mathiesen and Theitic, ''The Rede of the Wiccae: Adriana Porter, Gwen Thompson and the Birth of a Tradition of Witchcraft'', Olympian press, Rhode Island, 2005, pp.68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this fact Mathiesen concludes that early twentieth century authorship of at least part of the poem is probable. He argues that its references to English folklore are consistent with Porter's family history. His provisional conclusion is that a folkloric form of the poem may have been written by Porter, but that it was supplemented and altered by Thompson to add specifically Wiccan material. Mathiessen also takes the view that the last line was probably a Thompson addition derived from Valiente. According to this account, the 1974 variant of the text, which was published by one of Thompson's former initiates, may represent one of the earlier drafts. Its publication prompted Thompson to publish what she – falsely, according to Mathiessen – claimed was Porter's "original" poem.

==Interpretations of the Rede==
The Rede is similar to a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] formulation of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen, Grimassi, Starhawk|first=Kirsten, Raven|title=Exploring The Pagan Path: Wisdom From The Elders|year=2005|publisher=Carrier Press|isbn=1564147886}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief that is found in nearly every religion.{{CN|date=October 2017}} Not all traditional Wiccans follow the Rede; some [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerians]] (a sect under Wicca) espouse the [[Charge of the Goddess]] as a guide for morality. Its line ''"Keep pure your highest ideal, strive ever towards it; let naught stop you or turn you aside, for mine is the secret door which opens upon the door of youth"'' is used as a maxim for ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, Doreen. c.1953. Available Online at [http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm Ceisiwrserith.com.] Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate in the neo-Pagan and Wiccan communities as to the meaning of the Rede. The debate centres on the concept of the Rede being advice, not a commandment. The rejection of specific exhortations and prohibitions of conduct such as those given in the Judeo-Christian [[Ten Commandments]] and emphasis on the consequences of one's actions makes the Rede's character somewhat different from major religious texts such as the [[Bible]] or the [[Qur'an]]. The Rede is only a guideline which the individual must interpret to fit each particular situation and unlike most religions, which actions "do harm" (and which do not) are not discussed in the Rede. What exactly does and does not do harm is therefore open to personal interpretation.

The concept of ethical reciprocity is not explicitly stated, but most Wiccans interpret the Rede to imply the Golden Rule in the belief that the spirit of the Rede is to actively do good for one's fellow humans as well as for oneself. Different sects of Wiccans read "none" differently. "None" can apply to only the self, or it may include animals and/or plants, and so forth. In essence, the Rede can be fully understood as meaning that one should always follow their true will instead of trying to obtain simple wants and to ensure that following one's will does not harm anyone or anything. In this light, the Rede can be seen as encouraging a Wiccan to take personal responsibility for his or her actions.&lt;ref name="Ventimiglia, Mark 2003"&gt;Ventimiglia, Mark. ''Harm None''.
