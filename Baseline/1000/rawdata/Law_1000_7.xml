The USPTO separates goods and services into various classes, which are governed by international treaties. In order for an applicant to receive a trademark registration, that applicant must describe the goods and/or services to which the mark applies, and must identify the classes into which those goods and/or services fall. If the description is vague or does not match the content permitted in the classes claimed, then the application may be rejected until the applicant provides an acceptable description. By using the language set forth in the Manual, the applicant can be certain that the application will not be rejected on such a basis.

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], access to information is a Constitutional right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/greece
|title=Freedom of the Press 2016: Greece |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House|access-date=20 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information is governed by several laws since 1986, but according to [[Transparency International]] Greece the practical implementation of these provisions is quite poor.&lt;ref name=Transparency&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010-09-28_TI_EU_FOI.pdf  |title=Differences in access to information cultures and regulations in EU Member states: A problem for transparency in the EU? |last= |first= |date=2010 |website=Blog.transparency.org |publisher=Transparency International |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the [[Freedom of information legislation#European Union|European Union Directive 2003/98/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html Article 5 of the Administrative Procedures Code — Document Access] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730040742/http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html |date=2007-07-30 }} (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the financial crisis, a new law has been passed in July 2010 providing for the online publication of all decisions involving commitments of funds in the government sector.&lt;ref name=Transparency/&gt;

==FOI provisions under the law==

According to the Greek legal framework, all persons have the right to information in accordance with the law. Restrictions may be imposed only on the basis of reasons specified by law and insofar as they are absolutely necessary and justified for reasons of national security, contrast to [[Organized crime|organised crime]] and of protecting rights and interests of third parties.&lt;ref name=RTI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Greece  |title=Global Right to Information Rating: Greece |last= |first= |date=1 May 2016 |website=Rti-rating.org |publisher=Global Right to Information Rating |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek access to information law applies to administrative documents, in particular, only to a certain kind of administrative documents, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, replies of the Administration, opinions and resolutions.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The definition of the "public services" which are subject to access to information law includes all central, regional and local administration, but not the executive branch.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; The law does not specify if it applies also to State-owned enterprises (commercial entities that are owned or controlled by the State), to other public authorities (including constitutional, statutory and oversight body, such as election commission or information commissioner/er, or to private bodies performing a public function or receive significant public funding.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

Competent authorities are obliged to handle the requests and decide on them within the time limit, if any, stipulated by the relevant special provisions, otherwise, within sixty days. In case the request cannot be handled within this time limit, the competent service is obliged to notifying the following to the interested party in writing: the reason for the delay; the public officer to whom the case was assigned and his/her telephone number; the supporting documents that may be missing.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

Costs for accessing information under the FOI law are limited to the actual costs for reproducing the documents.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; According to the Greek access to information law, the competent legislative authority may refuse to satisfy the right of access to information if the documents requested refer to the discussion of the Cabinet of Ministers of if the satisfaction of this right may substantially obstruct the investigation of judicial, police or military authorities concerning the commission of a crime or an administrative violation.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The refusal to grant access to documents under the FOI law should be justified and notified in writing to the applicant within one month after the submission of the request.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; In case of refusals, applicants can apply to the administrative authority that issued the deed (application for remedy) or for the cancellation thereof to the superior authority of the authority that issued the deed (hierarchical appeal).&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; The right to lodge an external appeal with an independent oversight body (e.g. an information commission or [[ombudsman]]) is not mentioned by the law, Ombudsman in Greece has a proactive attitude in defence of the access to public document field.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The principle of transparency in all areas of public life, including media, is expected to be enhanced given that there is an Action Plan Promoting Open Government since 2014 ([[Greek Action Plan 2014-16]]). Technical and institutional changes have been adopted to enhance the principle of transparency and these should lead to the enhancement of the functionality of the [[DIAVGEIA]] project (Transparency Program Initiative),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diavgeia.gov.gr/en|title=DIAVGEIA Project, Transparency Program Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=diavgeia.gov.gr|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the publication of public procurements and to the open, transparent and secure exchange of public documents. The DIAVGEIA project began in October 1, 2010. Under this Transparency Program Initiative, all government institutions are obliged to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Each document is digitally signed and assigned a unique Internet Uploading Number (IUN) certifying that the decision has been uploaded at the “Transparency Portal”. Following the latest legislative initiative (Law 4210/2013) of the Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance, administrative acts and decisions are not valid unless published online.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In particular, as to the right to access public information, the innovations provided by the Action Plan promoting Open Government are the following:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*  Acts that are not published in the Official Gazette, are valid and get into force only if they are published on the Transparency Portal
* The uploaded document prevails over all other versions of the act (prototypes in paper)
* Uploaded acts can be used by citizens and the other public authorities without validation, by solely referring to their unique number.

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]], the Law on Access to Official Documents was enacted in 2010. The law repealed and superseded various other legislation and administrative orders that were previously in force.&lt;ref name=K2.0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/kosovar-journalists-need-demand-implementation-access-information-rights |title=Kosovar journalists need to demand implementation of their access to information rights|last=Sheremeti |first=Furtuna |date=31 January 2017 |website=Kosovotwopointzero.com |publisher=Kosovo 2.0 |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution. Several secondary acts aims at realizing the right and implement the 2010 Law. However, full implementation is lacking, the courts are slow to respond to appeals due to persistent backlogs in the judicial system.&lt;ref name=FH2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/kosovo |title=Kosovo. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date= 2015 |website=FreedomHouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the appeals process work, the institutions appear willing to ignore the rulings of the court when it comes to transparency and access to public information.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in 2016, the law on access to public documents is undergoing a procedure of amendment together with other laws to which it should be harmonized.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

==Legal framework==
In Kosovo [[Access to public information in Europe|access to public information]] is a right guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution which establishes that every person is entitled of the right of access to public information and that documents held by public institutions and organs of state authorities are public, except for information that can be concealed by law for reasons due to privacy, business trade secrets or public security.&lt;ref name=kryeministri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Besim M. Kajtazi |date=2013 |title= Legislation Summary on the Right of Access to Public Documents |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/II.__SUMMARY_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_ACCESS_TO_PUBLIC_DOCUMENTS.pdf |publisher=the Republic of Kosovo. The Office of the Prime Minister |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the right of access to official documents is guaranteed by many international agreements and declarations, such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] and Protocols which are directly applicable in the Republic of Kosovo and have priority in case of conflict of applicable laws.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

There are also special laws regulating the application of the right of access to public information, such as the Law on Administrative procedure and the Law on Civil Service of the Republic of Kosovo.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

Specifically, to implement the constitutional right of every person to have access, upon request, to documents of public interest held by public authorities, in 2010 the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo approved the '''Law no. 03/L-215 on Access to Public Documents (LAPD).''' The LAPD Law applies to all documents maintained, drafted and received by public institutions and is based on ten principles:
* everyone has the right of access to information;
* access is the rule, secret is the exception;
* the law applies to all public bodies;
* the request should be simple, fast and free for the requester;
* officials have the duty to support the applicants in their search for information;
* the refusal should be justified;
* public interest is more important than secret;
* the right to appeal is guaranteed in case of negative reply;
* public authorities should proactively publish basic information;
* the right to information should be guaranteed by an independent body.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

===Procedures for exercising the right of access to information===
Requesting and obtaining public information is free of charge. A fee may only be charged to applicants for copies of the document requested and have to be reasonable and aiming at only covering the actual costs of reproduction and document delivery.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt; Exceptions to the right of access to public information can be applied and are defined by law.

According to the relevant law, access to public information may be restricted only for the purpose of protecting the public legitimate interests of life or other legitimate private interests, such as the right to privacy and for public security reasons.&lt;ref name="kryeministri" /&gt;  Other reasons for exceptions include: defence and international relations; detection and investigation of criminal activities, disciplinary investigations, atc.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

The request can be made in writing or orally.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

Public institutions have to respond to citizens' requests within seven days with their decision to fully or partially grant the access. The deadline for review may be exceptionally extended to 15 days.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

The respect of the right of access to public information is guaranteed by the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson Institution]], an independent body supporting citizens to realize the right of access to documents that have been denied, according to the Law on Ombudsperson.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

In case of rejection of the applicant's request, and non-response by the relevant authority within the deadline, the applicant can start an appeal procedure in front of the Ombudsperson Institutions or the competent courts, in accordance with applicable law.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

The implementation of the laws on access to public information is problematic.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report, in practice the right of access to public information is “undermined by the authorities’ fragmented and unclear approach”.&lt;ref name=CE2016&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=9 November 2016 |title= Commission staff working Document Kosovo* 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_kosovo.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, according to the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)]]  the realization of the right is hindered by a secretive mentality and culture of many public authorities in the country.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drejtesianekosove.com/repository/docs/report_on_access_to_public_documents_2013-2014_824655.pdf |title=Report on Access to Public Documents 2013-2014 |last= |first= |date=June 2014 |website= |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, According to the news portal [[Kosovo 2.0]], institutions tend to disclose information on less important issues and when lower level institutions, such as municipalities, are involved.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Other flaws in the application of the law consists in its misinterpretation, for instance in distinguishing between what to consider private and what a public interest, and the application of ''ad hoc'' administrative measures by certain institutions. According to Kosovo 2.0, even when the law is very clear in specifying procedures, certain institutions have created their own procedures which are not always in line with the law, resulting in barriers for interested applicants. For instance, there are numerous institutions requiring the payment of 1 euro when filling a freedom of information request, which is in contradiction with the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Another problem concerns the officials who are responsible for receiving and processing freedom of information requests. According to Kosovo 2.0 in many cases they are not properly trained to effectively execute the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

In Kosovo, the majority of requests for accessing public information are submitted by journalists, activists and civil society organizations, and very few by citizens that are not fully aware of their right of access to public information.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to a survey carried out in 2012, the level of knowledge about the content of the law on access to public information among citizens was extremely deficient, as well as their interest in making requests for access to public documents.&lt;ref name=FOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://levizjafol.org/folnew/kosovo-with-a-low-level-of-implementation-of-the-law-on-access-to-public-documents/?lang=en   |title=Kosovo with a low level of implementation of the law on access to public documents |last= |first= |date= 28 September 2012 |website=Levizjafol.org |publisher=Lëvizja FOL Movement |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test and monitor the implementation of the law, BIRN has submitted a series of requests for information to the majority of public institutions, at all levels, in Kosovo. From June 2013 to May 2014, it submitted a total of 125 official requests: of the requests submitted, 68 were denied, 50 approved and 7 partially denied, meaning that requested documents were received in only 40 per cent of cases. This result is considered as “rather poor” by the organisation.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; During the same monitoring period, one of the major problems observed by BIRN concerned access to courts information, in particular indictments.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; Another common problem highlighted by the organization is that, in practice and despite the law’s provisions, the institution that does not have the information requested usually rejects the requests, rather than forwarding it to another  institution that may have it as required by the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; According to another test, implemented between October 2013 to April 2016, only 25 per cent of BIRN’s requests were approved and 38 were rejected.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

== Roads and air rights ==
Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air? Only in New York Real Estate |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 30, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30air.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">The '''articles of impeachment''' are the set of charges drafted against a public official to initiate the [[impeachment]] process.  The articles of impeachment do not result in the removal of the official, but instead require the enacting body to take further action, such as bringing the articles to a vote before the full body

In the [[United States]], the articles of impeachment are drafted by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for cases involving federal officials.  Once drafted, a [[supermajority]] of the [[United States Senate]] is required to convict based on the articles.

A person of a high office can be impeached if they have committed a high misdemeanor, a felony, or treason. An impeachment trial is carried out in the Senate, with the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]] presiding if the impeachment involves the President. Impeachment can expand beyond senior members of the White House. A [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice may be impeached for committing a high misdemeanor, treason, or a felony. Impeachment charges must be drafted in the House of Representatives. The trial for the person undergoing such occurs in the Senate, requiring 60 votes or more of 100 senators to successfully impeach a public official.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">The '''Ashwander rules''', articulated by [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Louis D. Brandeis]], are a set of principles used by the [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] for avoiding constitutional rulings.

== Rules for Judicial Self-Restraint and Avoiding Constitutional Questions ==
Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Louis D. Brandeis]], concurring in ''[[Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority]]'', 297 U.S. 288 (1936), summarized some prudential rules for exercising judicial self-restraint and avoiding ruling on the constitutionality of congressional legislation:

[[Supreme Court of the United States|The Court]] developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its [[jurisdiction]], a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:

# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the  [[Act of Congress|legislative act]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Wellman'', 143 U.S. 339 (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885"&gt;''Liverpool, N.Y. &amp; P.S.S. Co. v. Emigration Commissioners'', 113 U.S. 33 (1885)&lt;/ref&gt; "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case." &lt;ref&gt;''Burton v. United States'', 196 U.S. 283 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "formulate a rule of  [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] broader than is required by the Precise facts to which it is to be applied." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885" /&gt;
# The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of [[statutory construction]] or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.
# The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right to challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. (While not mentioned in ''Ashwander'', there are exceptions in the case of a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenge where the party may raise the effect of a law on other person's First Amendment rights, the so called "[[chilling effect]]" doctrine.)
# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.
# "When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided." &lt;ref&gt;''Crowell v. Benson'', 285 U.S. 22 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[United States Reports]]'' is the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]

'''Case citation''' is a system used by legal professionals to identify past [[court case]] decisions, either in series of books called [[Reporter (law)|reporters]] or [[law report]]s, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.

A '''legal citation''' is a "reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
* Court that issued the decision
* Report title
* Volume number
* Page, section, or paragraph number
* Publication year

In some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s "{{bracket|year}}" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).

The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

The resulting flood of unpaginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system.  This usually contains the following information:
* Year of decision
* Abbreviated title of the court
* Decision number (not the court file number)
Rather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.

The conjunction "versus" is abbreviated to "v" in Commonwealth countries and to "v." in the United States.

==Pronunciation of case titles==

In [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v''{{mdash}}usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the US. The abbreviation represents the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|pages=5–6|date=August 2012|quote=The small letter “v” is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term “and” is used to pronounce it, rather than “v” or “versus”, e.g. the case “Smith v Jones” would be pronounced “Smith and Jones”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth pronunciation===

Commonwealth countries follow British legal style:

* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''.  For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced "Smith {{em|and}} Jones".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;
* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''.  For example, ''R v Smith'' would be pronounced "the Crown {{em|against}} Smith".&lt;ref name="soas_uk_criminal"&gt;{{cite web|website=SOAS Library: Research Guides|title=Understanding UK Case Law|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf|author=School of Oriental and African Studies Library, University of London|page=5|date=August 2012|quote=A case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. “R v Smith” would be pronounced either “the Crown against Smith”, or it can be referred to as simply “Smith” }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin words ''Rex'', ''Regina'', and ''versus'' are all rendered into English.
* ''Versus'' and ''vee'' are incorrect.&lt;ref name="soas_uk_civil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melbourne University Law Review Association|title=Australian Guide to Legal Citation|date=2010|isbn=9780646527390|page=43|edition=3rd|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc|quote=In speech, the 'v' between the parties' names is rendered 'and' in a civil action and 'against' in a criminal action both in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not pronounced 'versus' as it is in the United States of America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American pronunciation===

In the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation ''v.''  This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:&lt;ref name="nyt1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=On Language: Child's Garden of Vs.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/magazine/on-language-child-s-garden-of-vs.html|agency=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Versus'' is most commonly used,&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt; leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation ''vs.'' in place of the legal abbreviation ''v.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=How the Airlines Became Abusive Cartels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/how-the-airlines-became-abusive-cartels.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2017|quote=Today’s auction system on oversold flights, ironically, is the stepchild of a 1976 Supreme Court case, Nader vs. Allegheny, in which the late and little lamented Allegheny Airlines (known to its long suffering passengers as Agony Airlines) picked the wrong passenger to bump.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vee'' is also heard but is not as common.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;
* ''Against'' is a matter of personal style.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;  For example, [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with ''against''.&lt;ref name=oyez_betamax&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1687|title=''Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.''|quote=Warren E. Burger: Before we hear the arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City Studios ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oyez_smith&gt;{{cite web|title=''Smith v. Massachusetts''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-8661|website=Oyez|quote=John Paul Stevens: We'll hear argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''And'' is used by some law professors, but other law professors regard it as an affectation.&lt;ref name="nyt1989"/&gt;

During [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus by using different pronunciations of ''v.'' Solicitor General [[Ken Starr]] even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:&lt;ref name=oyez_casey&gt;{{cite web|title=''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744|website=Oyez|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=[[Ken Starr|Kenneth W. Starr]]: This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe ''versus'' Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold ''against'' Connecticut. ... Well, I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe ''vee'' Wade.}}

==Australia==
Legal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in [[England]]. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

The standard case citation format in Australia is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''
| (1992)
|
| 175
| CLR
|
| 1.
|}

As in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

===Neutral citation===
Australian courts and tribunals have now adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.&lt;ref name="austlii"&gt;[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|HCA
|1
|}
So the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts.  The court and tribunal identifiers include:
{| class="wikitable"

==Canada==
There are a number of citation standards in Canada. Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard—formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation]]'', commonly known as the "[[McGill Guide]]" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:

:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.

Broken into its component parts, the format is:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',
|
| [1985]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 295.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',
|
| [1986]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 103.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''
| (1990),
|
|69
|DLR
|(4th)
|321
|(Ont CA).
|}

The ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.

Undisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Constitutional references]] are always entitled "''Reference re''" followed by the subject title.

If the year of decision is the same as the year of the report, and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.

Where available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,

:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.

This format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.

The seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (".") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent)

* Canadian Citation Committee [http://www.lexum.com/ccc-ccr/neutr/neutr.jur_en.html A Neutral Citation Standard for Case Law]

== Denmark ==
There is no official standard for case citations in Denmark, and the citation format also varies depending on how the reporter in question indexes their judgments (i.e. by page number or giving each case an identifier). However, citations usually include the same components:
* The name or abbreviation of the reporter.
* The year of the reporter.
* The page number or identifier of the case.
* The name or abbreviation of the court who heard the case.
As an example, a case from the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] (Højesteret) published in the [[Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen]], the main reporter of decisions, in the year 2001 on page 2327 could be cited in various different ways, as exemplified by this non-exhaustive list:
* UfR 2001.2327 H
* U 2001.2327 HD
* U 2001 p. 2327
* Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 2001 p. 2327
The above example is from a reporter that cites cases by page number. Another reporter, Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, gives each case a number instead. The above case was given the identifier 719 and would be cited using 719 instead of a page number (e.g. TfS 2001/179 H or TfS 2001/179 HD, among others).{{Efn-ur|group=Denmark|name=Examples|Note how Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen can be cited both as "UfR" or simply "U". Additionally, p. (page) would be written as s. (side) in Danish. This particular example is, in part, from {{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|p=11}}}}

Cases that have not been published in a reporter should be cited using the name of the court, the date of the decision and the court's own case number. For example:
* Højesterets dom af 17. februar 2010 fra Højesteret, sag 269/2009 ([[English language|English]]: The Supreme Court's judgment of the 17th of February 2010, case 269/2009)
As with reporter citations, the composition and wording of the citation can vary, the key is to include enough information for the reader to be able to acquire it.{{Efn-ur|{{Harvnb|Madsen|2018|pp=11-12}}}}

==Germany==
{{main|German legal citation}}
In Germany there are two types of citation: the full citation of a case and its shortened form. In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the [[European Case Law Identifier]], a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the [[Council of the European Union]] in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

===Federal Constitutional Court of Germany===
The most important cases of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated ''BVerfGE'', whereas ''BVerfG'' is short for ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'', the German court name, and ''E'' stands for ''Entscheidung'' (decision).

Starting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a ''Kammer'', a specific part of the court.

The so-called [[:de:Volkszählungsurteil|Volkszählungsurteil]] for example could be cited
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.
in full and
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43).
in short.

{| class="wikitable"

| Urteil des Ersten Senats&lt;br /&gt;vom 15. Dezember 1983&lt;br /&gt;[in case of a hearing:] auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983,
| Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83
|}

For the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].

If decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,
:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).
Where ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) – "f." stands for "seq.". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.

===Federal Court of Justice of Germany===
The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].

The [[:de:Katzenkönigfall|Katzenkönigfall]] e.g. would be cited
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.
in full and
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.
in short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; "ff." means "sqq.").

===Other federal courts===
The official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.

===Other courts===
For other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.

===European Case Law Identifier===
According to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volkszählungsurteil'' would be cited as 
:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983
and the ''Katzenkönigfall'' as 
:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0

==India==
India's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India – subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.

===Supreme Court of India===
The  official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.

[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]

''[[Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India]]'':
* AIR 1984 SC 571 – "AIR" refers to the ''All India Reporter'', "1984" is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), "SC" refers to the Supreme Court of India, and "571" is the first page number of the report within the volume;
* (1984) 1 SCC 339 – "1984" is the year of publication, "1" is the volume number of the reporter, "SCC" stands for ''Supreme Court Cases'' (the name of the reporter), and "339" is the first page number of the report within the volume; and
* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) – "1984" is the year of publication, "Cri LJ" is an abbreviation for the ''Criminal Law Journal'' (the name of the reporter), and "289" is the first page number of the report within the volume. The "SC" in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.

A citation of the "Supreme Court Almanac":
* ''[[Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia]]'' (1990) 2 Scale 1352

A citation in "Judgements Today":
* ''[[Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu]]'' JT (1994) 1 SC 374

The "Supreme Court Cases (SCC)" published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:
* ''[[Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan]]'' 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.

The SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:
* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports
* ''[[Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress]]'' 1991 SCC (L&amp;S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour &amp; Services Reports

===High Courts===
The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where "Cal" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===

National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research &amp; Reference System (JRRS) – JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.

The Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

This Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

==New Zealand==
The standard case citation format in New Zealand is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of reporter]
! volume
! reporter
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''

| NZLR
| 394
|- valign="top"
|  ''R v Howse''
| (2005)
|
| 21
| CRNZ
| 823
|}

Several leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.

===Reporters===
{| class="wikitable"

|1981–
|}

Additionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Neutral citation===
New Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|NZSC
|1
|}

There is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Court Identifier
!Court
!Years
|- valign="top"
|NZSC
|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]
| 2005–
|- valign="top"
|NZCA
|[[New Zealand Court of Appeal]]

| NZEnvC
|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]
| 2010–
|- valign="top"
| NZFC
|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]
| 2012–
|}

Where both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750

==Norway==
The Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:

:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''

where:

* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.
** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.
** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).
* '''1952''' is the year of reporter
* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.
* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.
* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment ("telefonsjikane") was not illegal under the current criminal code.

==The Philippines==
Despite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which report of a case is relied on by the person citing that case. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Official reporter===
The ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:

:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)

where:

* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case
* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found
* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''
* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found
* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.

As of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues. The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:

Juarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475

where 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.

===Unofficial reporter===
In the last few decades, the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:

:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624

where:

* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case
* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. means ''General Register'')
* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated
* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found
* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''
* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found

Owing to the delays in the regular publication of the Philippine Reports, reliance on the SCRA has been tolerated, although if a case may be found at the Philippine Reports, it is preferred that the official reporter be cited in lieu of the SCRA.

When citing cases not yet reported in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)

===Lower court decisions===
As there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: ''(case name)'', ''(docket number)'', ''(Exact date of promulgation of decision)''.

==Switzerland==
Citations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arrêts du tribunal fédéral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, "E. 3.2" and "S. 296" are the section and page specifically cited.

Supreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. März 2007'' or ''arrêt [du Tribunal fédéral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.

The citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.

==United Kingdom==

===Neutral citation===
{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}
Since 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).
	
Neutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, &lt;br /&gt;''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 &lt;br/&gt;identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).

===How to cite a case===
{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}
If a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases – AC, Chancery – Ch, Family – Fam, Queen's Bench – QB etc.).

The case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.

This means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.

To cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].

If a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.

For cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:

*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.
*See [http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]

===England and Wales===
The standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''
|
| [1932]

| (HL).
|-valign="top"
|''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''
|(1884)
|
|14
|QBD
|
|273.
|
|}

In [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation "R" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).

[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] "[ ]" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either—as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above—do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.).  [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] "( )" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.

===Law Reports===
The term "reporter", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)

Two main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).

For the citation of "The Law Reports" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench—KB—depending on the monarch of the time). These four series are cited in preference to all others in court.

==United States==
The standard case citation format in the United States is:
:''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
where:
*''Roe v. Wade'' is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to "[[Jane Roe]]," a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.
*410 is the volume number of the "[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.
*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, "U.S." stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.
*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.
*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.
*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.

Case citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.

This format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Cases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:

*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

Many court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a "parallel citation". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&amp;nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&amp;nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:

*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)

The "2d" after the L.&amp;nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a "2d" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.

Some very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The "(1 Cranch)" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called "[[nominative reports]]", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, "5 U.S. (1&amp;nbsp;Cranch)" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, "4 U.S. (4 Dall.)"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., "15 U.S. (2&amp;nbsp;Wheat.)"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.

When a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}}.

In the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.

===Lower federal courts===
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]
[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' "official" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: "Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required."&lt;/ref&gt;

When lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:

*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) – a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]
*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) – a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]

U.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).

===State courts===
State court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated "Cal." (or, for subsequent series, "Cal. 2d," "Cal. 3d", or "Cal. 4th").

*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) – a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated "Ill." (or "Ill. 2d"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).

[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]
In addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of "regional reporters" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their "official" reporter.

Here are some examples of how to cite West reporters:

*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) – a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series
*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) – a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''
*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) – a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that "N.Y." is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.

Abbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Like the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; "6 Met." refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.

Some states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm "New York Law Reports Style Manual"]&lt;/ref&gt; In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Either way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.

For example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:

*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).

And, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:

*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unpublished decisions===
{{main|Non-publication}}
A growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: "Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process." The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: "Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Attorneys have several options in citing "unpublished" decisions:
* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.
**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) – a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).
* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered "published" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered "unpublished" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated "F. App'x").
* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often "published" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:
**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) – a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).
**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) – a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).

Some court systems—such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]] and the federal [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeals]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuits]]—forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and "there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.

===Vendor-neutral citations===
With the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their "unpublished" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.

A vendor-neutral citation movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee]; accessed May 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases "published" on the web.

An example of a vendor-neutral citation:
*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) – a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court ("1997 FED App. 0318P") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).

===Pinpoint citations===
In practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, "pin cites", or "jump cites".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.law.tulane.edu/content.php?pid=209935&amp;sid=5027306 Using Pinpoints], Tulane University Law School, Legal Citation Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word "person" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).

And a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).

But in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).

Even then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style. Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.

===Types of citations===
There are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2919">'''Community Legal Advice''' is a government-funded advice service set up by the [[Legal Services Commission]] as part of the Community Legal Service. It aims to help people in [[England]] and [[Wales]] deal with [[Civil law (common law)|civil legal]] problems, and is part of the [[legal aid]] programme in those nations.

It comprises a telephone helpline, advice centres and a series of advice leaflets. Its services also previously included an informational website whose functions were taken over by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] site in February 2011. See: [http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/public/community_legal_advice_helpline.asp www.legalservices.gov.uk/public/community_legal_advice_helpline.asp]

Until November 2008 the service was known as Community Legal Service Direct, and before that as "Just Ask!"

== Telephone helpline ==
The Community Legal Advice telephone helpline gives specific, independent advice to people living on benefits or low income.

Community Legal Advice covers six legal areas:

* Debt
* Welfare benefits and tax credits
* Housing
* Employment
* Education
* Family

== Website ==
The Community Legal Advice website provided self-help information and tools to help people deal with common legal problems themselves. It included advice on areas of law not covered by the telephone helpline such as consumer law, health and social care. By February 2011 (like the online services of the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] in 2007), it was absorbed by the Department of Justice website.  The original CLA site remains readable in "snapshots" in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http://www.communitylegaladvice.org.uk UK government web archive] Retrieved 2011-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Legal Advice Centres ==
The Legal Services Commission also operates walk-in Community Legal Advice Centres. Centres give free, generalized, face-to-face legal advice at an initial appointment and further specialized advice for people eligible for legal aid.

Five Community Legal Advice Centres have been opened in
* Derby
* Gateshead
* Hull
* Leicester
* Portsmouth

Centres are jointly funded by the Legal Services Commission and local councils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/civil/innovations/community_legal_advice_centres_and_networks.asp Legal Services Commission website] Retrieved 2011-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19868">'''Compact theory''' refers to two theories related to the development of [[Federation|federal]] [[constitution]]s. In the United States, it differs from the contract theory in that it favored the rights of states over those of the Federal Government.

==Compact theory in the United States==
Regarding the [[Constitution of the United States]], the compact theory holds that the country was formed through a compact agreed upon by all the states, and that the federal government is thus a creation of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Compact of the Republic: The League of States and the Constitution]] |last=Benner |first=David |authorlink=David Benner |year=2015 |publisher=Life &amp; Liberty Publishing Group |location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, states should be the final arbiters over whether the federal government had overstepped the limits of its authority as set forth in the compact.

===Arguments in favor of the theory===
Leading proponents of this view of the U.S. Constitution primarily originated from Virginia and other southern states.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Notable proponents of the theory include [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomformula.us/classes/live-class-resources/jefferson-giles-12-26-1825/ Jefferson to William B. Giles in letter dated 12/26/1825].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this theory and in reaction to the [[Alien and Sedition Acts|Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798]], Jefferson claimed the federal government overstepped its authority, and advocated nullification of the laws by the states. The first resolution of the [[Kentucky Resolutions]] began by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that the several States composing the [[United States of America]], are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government; but that by compact under the style and title of a [[United States Constitution|Constitution for the United States]] and of [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]] thereto, they constituted a General Government for special purposes, delegated to that Government certain definite powers, reserving each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self Government; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party; that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1798|Kentucky Resolutions of 1798]]; see also "Reclaiming the American Revolution," Wm. J. Watkins, Jr.,Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Arguments against the theory===
Others have taken the position that the federal government is not a compact among the states, but instead was formed directly by the people, in their exercise of their sovereign power. The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states, which are not parties to the Constitution, do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority, but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took this position in response to the [[Kentucky Resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;In response to the Kentucky Resolutions' assertion that the states formed the federal government by compact and retained the right to judge the federal government's laws, Vermont said: "This cannot be true. The old confederation, it is true, was formed by the state Legislatures, but the present Constitution of the United States was derived from an higher authority. The people of the United States formed the federal constitution, and not the states, or their Legislatures. And although each state is authorized to propose amendments, yet there is a wide difference between proposing amendments to the constitution, and assuming, or inviting, a power to dictate and control the General Government." {{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Frank Maloy | chapter = [[s:Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions/II|Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] | publisher = American Historical Review | year = 1899 | location = | pages = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Webster]] advocated this view in his [[Webster-Hayne debate|debate with Robert Hayne]] in the Senate in 1830:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it, declares that it is ordained and established ''by the people of the United States''. So far from saying that it is established by the governments ''of the several States'', it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate. . . . When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a ''Constitution''; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a ''Constitution'', therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Great Speeches and Orations of Daniel Webster/The Reply to Hayne|Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, January 26, 1830]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leading nineteenth century commentary on the Constitution, Justice [[Joseph Story]]'s ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'' (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory, concluding that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not by the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.&lt;ref&gt;Story wrote: "In what light, then, is the constitution of the United States to be regarded? Is it a mere compact, treaty, or confederation of the states composing the Union, or of the people thereof, whereby each of the several states, and the people thereof, have respectively bound themselves to each other? Or is it a form of government, which, having been ratified by a majority of the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them, as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power, to the extent of its provisions? . . . There is nowhere found upon the face of the constitution any clause, intimating it to be a compact, or in anywise providing for its interpretation, as such. On the contrary, the preamble emphatically speaks of it, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government. The language is, 'We, the people of the United States, do ''ordain'' and ''establish'' this ''constitution'' for the United States of America.' ''The people'' do ''ordain'' and ''establish'', not contract and stipulate with each other. The people of the ''United States'', not the distinct people of a ''particular state'' with the people of the other states. The people ordain and establish a '''constitution'',' not a '''confederation''.' . . . Nor should it be omitted, that in the most elaborate expositions of the constitution by its friends, its character, as a permanent form of government, as a fundamental law, as a supreme rule, which no state was at liberty to disregard, suspend, or annul, was constantly admitted, and insisted on, as one of the strongest reasons, why it should be adopted in lieu of the confederation." {{cite book |title=[[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States]] |last=Story |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Story |year=1833 |publisher=Hilliard Gray &amp; Co. |location=Boston |pages=318–319, 326 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1828-1832, [[John C. Calhoun]] argued in his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this "right of judging" as "an essential attribute of sovereignty," which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter bold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights. . . . But the existence of the right of judging of their powers, so clearly established from the sovereignty of States, as clearly implies a veto or control, within its limits, on the action of the General Government, on contested points of authority. . . . May the General Government . . . encroach on the rights reserved to the States respectively? To the States respectively each in its sovereign capacity is reserved the power, by its veto, or right of interposition, to arrest the encroachment." [[s:South Carolina Exposition and Protest|South Carolina Exposition and Protest, 1828]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession. The southern states argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights in their slaves. The southern states stated that they therefore were justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.&lt;ref&gt;For example, South Carolina's statement of secession said: "Thus was established, by compact between the States, a Government with definite objects and powers, limited to the express words of the grant. . . . [T]he constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation. . . . Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection." [[s:Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the Court has stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states.

In one of the Supreme Court's first significant decisions, ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which says that the Constitution was ordained and established by "We the people," and stated: "Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound."&lt;ref&gt;"[The people] made a Confederation of the States the basis of a general government [i.e. the Articles of Confederation]. Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it, and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, established the present Constitution. It is remarkable that, in establishing it, the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and, conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, 'We the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner, and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects in a certain manner." ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). Jay went on to say that the people had delegated to the federal judiciary the task of interpreting the meaning, construction, and operation of the Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states, stating: "The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterizing the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, while stating that the Constitution was established not by the states, but by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.' . . . The Constitution was for a new Government, organized with new substantive powers, and not a mere supplementary charter to a Government already existing. The Confederation was a compact between States, and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the National Government. The Constitution was an act of the people of the United States to supersede the Confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment." ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people, and was not created by the states. The Court stated that the Constitution was binding on the states and could not be negated by the states. The Court again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The government proceeds directly from the people; is 'ordained and established' in the name of the people, and is declared to be ordained, 'in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.' . . . It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the State Governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties. . . . To the formation of a league such as was the Confederation, the State sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, 'in order to form a more perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective Government, possessing great and sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The Government of the Union then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case) is, emphatically and truly, a Government of the people. In form and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit." ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' (1869), a case discussing the legal status of the southern states that had attempted to secede, the Supreme Court stated that the union was not merely a compact among states; rather, the union was "something more than a compact."&lt;ref&gt;"When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States." ''[[Texas v. White]]'', 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compact theory in Canada==

In the [[Canada|Canadian]] context, compact theory posits that [[Confederation of Canada|Confederation]] was an agreement between the two founding peoples, [[French Canadian|French]] and English, and that therefore [[Quebec]] should have special [[veto]] powers relating to its position in the federal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brooks, ''Canadian Democracy: An Introduction'', 5th ed. (Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2007), 201.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, compact theory was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the 1981 [[Patriation Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Compact theory is often advanced by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]].

'''Connivance''' is the act of conniving or conspiring, especially with the knowledge of and active or passive consent to wrongdoing or a twist in truth, to make something appear as something that it is not.

A legal finding of connivance may be made when an accuser has assisted in the act about which they are complaining. In some legal jurisdictions, and for certain behaviors, it may prevent the accuser from prevailing.

For example, if someone were to entice their spouse to commit [[adultery]], they might be blocked (or [[estoppel|estopped]]) from divorcing their spouse on grounds of that adultery. See ''Sargent v. Sargent'', Court of Chancery of New Jersey, 1920 (Held a man who had not taken active steps to prevent his wife's adultery was not entitled to divorce because he was a participator and consenter to her adultery).

A '''constitutional dictatorship''' is a form of government in which dictatorial powers are exercised during an emergency. The dictator is not absolute and the dictator's authority remains limited by the constitution.

The [[Roman Republic]] made provision for a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] who could govern unchecked for a stipulated period of time. Unlike other magistrates, a dictator was not subject to review of his actions at the conclusion of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dictator.html A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.], Dictator&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] has a similar dictator clause stating that the President "may adjourn [congress] to such Time as he shall think proper" if the two houses disagree on when to adjourn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html Constitution of the United States], Article II, Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abraham Lincoln]], President of the United States during the American Civil War, exercised extraordinary powers to preserve the Union. Lincoln's dictatorial actions included directly ordering the arrest and detention of dissenters and the suspension of the right to writs of habeas corpus. However, Lincoln remained subject to Congressional oversight, judicial review, and periodic elections.

The [[Weimer Republic]], which succeeded [[Imperial Germany]] after the [[First World War]], adopted a constitutional provision that expressly enabled the president to rule by decree, without consultation with the legislative branch. That provision was used by Chancellor [[Hitler]] to consolidate his powers upon his selection by President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].

US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] also exercised extraordinary powers in response to the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Second World War]]. Roosevelt's actions included violating the US Constitution's [[Contract Clause]], the closing of banks, and a moratorium on [[foreclosure]]s. Later, meeting a perceived threat by Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans, Roosevelt ordered their [[internment of Japanese Americans|relocation to internment camps]].

In the 21st century, [[John Yoo]], attorney and legal theorist, has offered a theory of the unitary executive for massive authority of the US President, in his capacity as [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. Yoo provided the intellectual foundation for many of the actions undertaken by the [[George W. Bush administration]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]].

'''Constitutional theory''' is an area of '''[[constitutional law]]''' that focuses on the underpinnings of constitutional government. It overlaps with [[legal theory]], [[constitutionalism]], [[philosophy of law]] and democratic theory. It is not limited by country or jurisdiction.

== United States ==

Constitutional theory in the [[United States]] is an academic discipline that focuses on the meaning of the United States [[Constitution]].  Its concerns include (but are not limited to) the historical, linguistic, sociological, ethical, and political aspects.

Much of constitutional theory is concerned with theories of [[judicial review]]. This is in part because ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', which established this judicial power in the early 19th century, has given the judiciary near-final authority on constitutional meaning.

Aside from judicial review, constitutional theory in general seeks to ask and answer the following questions:

*How should the Constitution be interpreted?
*How much weight should be given to the history of the Constitution's framing?
*How much, if any, of the Constitution's meaning can be read as implicit in the text?
*What vision of republican&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/cons/constitu.htm#con4.4&lt;/ref&gt; government does the Constitution seek to further?
*How does constitutional meaning shift with other changes in the political structure?
*How does constitutional meaning shift with changes in cultural norms?
*What is the proper relationship between individual rights and state power?
*What is the proper relationship between the branches of government
**This question involves the power of judicial review, noted above
*What is the proper relationship between the federal government and the states?

Although constitutional theory as a discipline has its precursors in ''[[The Federalist]]'' and [[Justice Story]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Constitution]]'', modern constitutional theory began with the publication of [[Alexander Bickel]]'s ''[[The Least Dangerous Branch]]''. (The title is an allusion to ''The Federalist'' No. 78, in which [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote that the judiciary "will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution", because it has neither the sword (like the Executive) nor the purse (like the Legislature).  The book's primary (but not sole) contribution was to introduce the idea of the "[[countermajoritarian difficulty]]."  The idea expressed by the term countermajoritarian difficulty is that there is a tension between democratic government (as he defines it democratic government is majoritarian government) and judicial power.  If the judiciary—an unelected branch of government—can overturn popular legislation, then either there is a fundamental contradiction within the democratic system, or there is a tension that must be resolved by curbing judicial power.  (One of Bickel's solutions is for the Court to exercise "the [[passive virtues]]": that is, to decline to decide more than it has to decide.)

== German Rechtsstaat==
The Rechtsstaat doctrine (Legal state, State of Right, Constitutional state, constitutional government) was introduced in the latest works of the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written [[constitution]]. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and [[constitutional government]].

Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a [[State (polity)|state]] is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty-first century. The Legal state concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals:
“The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law.”.&lt;ref&gt;"Immanuel Kant", ''History of [[Political Philosophy]]'', edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian legal state ==
The Russian legal system, borne out of transformations in the 19th Century under the [[judicial reform of Alexander II]], is based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from here that Russia borrowed a doctrine of Rechtsstaat, which literally translates as Legal State. The English most close analogue is «rule of law».&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Rechtsstaat  is a concept in continental European legal thinking, originally borrowed from German legal philosophy, which can be translated as “legal state” or "state of law", or "state of rights", "constitutional state" in which the exercise of governmental power is constrained by the law.  The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as a supreme law of the country (the rule of constitution).&lt;ref&gt;The former President of the [[International Bar Association]] Francis Neate wrote about links between Russian concept of the Legal state and British approach: “The [[Rule of Law]] is an English concept.  I am told that the equivalent in Russia, and possibly in other countries, is better translated as ‘Legal State’, or ‘a state governed by law’.  If the latter phrase is acceptable then surely we are talking about the same thing... The best way to determine whether or not we are talking about the same concept is to look at the essential characteristics of the Rule of Law and to determine whether or not they are similar to the essential characteristics of the ‘Legal State’.  This is what I propose to do.”, "The Rule of Law: Perspectives from Around the Globe", Editor: Francis Neate, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of “legal state” (“pravovoe gosudarstvo” in Russian) is a fundamental, but undefined, principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s [[Constitution of Russia|post-Communist constitution]]:  “The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance.”  Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] declares: “Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state.”  The effort to give meaning to definition “Legal State” is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]], wrote in 2003:
“Becoming a legal state  has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. 
However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination.  Such a Legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and
just society.  Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by society.".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of legal state adopted many segments of the [[constitutional economics]]. One of the founders of constitutional economics [[James M. Buchanan]], the 1986 recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] argues that in the framework of constitutional government any governmental interventions and regulations have been based on three assumptions.
* First, every failure of the [[market economy]] to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention.
* Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being.
* And, third, changing the responsibilities of [[government]] towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">On March 15, 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] presented a speech to the United States Congress in which he extolled four basic consumer rights, later called the '''Consumer Bill of Rights'''. The United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] expanded these into eight rights, and thereafter [[Consumers International]] adopted these rights as a charter and started recognizing March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day.

==Background==
Before the mid-twentieth century, consumers had limited rights with regard to their interaction with products and commercial producers. Consumers had limited ground on which to defend themselves against faulty or defective products, or against misleading or deceptive advertising methods.

The [[consumer movement]] began to gather a following, pushing for increased rights and legal protection against malicious business practices. By the end of the 1950s, legal [[product liability]] had been established in which an aggrieved party need only prove injury by use of a product, rather than bearing the burden of proof of corporate negligence.

[[Helen Ewing Nelson]] was a drafter of the Consumer Bill of Rights and sought an outlet for distributing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-04/features/1995247035_1_helen-nelson-consumer-movement-consumer-rights |title=Pioneer fights on for consumer safety - Baltimore Sun |first=Rebecca |last=Smith |work=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=4 September 1995 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shearer |first=Julie |year=1977–1979 |title=Pat Brown - Friends and Campaigners |publisher=[[Regional Oral History Office]] |publication-place=[[Berkeley, California]] |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/patbrownfriends00rfryrich/patbrownfriends00rfryrich_djvu.txt |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumer-action.org/press/articles/helen_nelson_1913_2005 |title=Helen Nelson (1913-2005) will be greatly missed by the consumer movement |first= |last= |publisher=[[Consumer Action]] |work=consumer-action.org |date=23 March 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Kennedy's election campaign he made a promise to support consumers.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; After his election, [[Fred Dutton]], a colleague of Nelson's and a government officer who advised the president, asked for Nelson's suggestions on how the president could support consumers, and she sent him the Consumer Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; Kennedy presented those rights in a speech to Congress on March 15, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9108 |title=John F. Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest. |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |authorlink=John F. Kennedy |work=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=March 15, 1962 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that speech he named four basic rights of consumers.

== Some of the Rights ==

===The right to safety===
The assertion of this right is aimed at the defense of consumers against injuries caused by products other than automobile vehicles, and implies that products should cause no harm to their users if such use is executed as prescribed. The right was further formalized in 1972 by the US federal government through the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC). This organization has jurisdiction over thousands of commercial products, and powers that allow it to establish performance standards and require product testing and warning labels.

===The right to be informed===
This right states that businesses should always provide consumers with enough appropriate information to make intelligent and informed product choices. Product information provided by a business should always be complete and truthful. Aiming to achieve protection against misleading information in the areas of financing, advertising, labeling, and packaging, the right to be informed is protected by several pieces of legislation passed between 1960 and 1980.

Some of the legislation which was made because of the assertion of this right include the following:
*[[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (US)]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of business and finance|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0028660615|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-1552100067.html |edition=2.|last1=Lush |first1=Mary |last2=Hinton |first2=Val |editor=Burton S. Kalisk |chapter=Consumer Bill of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wholesome Meat Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;

===The right to choose===
The right to free choice among product offerings states that consumers should have a variety of options provided by different companies from which to choose. The federal government has taken many steps to ensure the availability of a healthy environment open to competition through legislation including limits on concept ownership through [[Patent Law|patent law]], prevention of monopolistic business practices through [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust legislation]], and the outlaw of price cutting and [[Price gouging|gouging]].

===The right to be heard===
This right has the ability of consumers to voice complaints and concerns about a product in order to have the issue handled efficiently and responsively. While no federal agency is tasked with the specific duty of providing a forum for this interaction between consumer and producer, certain outlets exist to aid consumers if difficulty occurs in communication with an aggrieving party. State and federal [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] are equipped to aid their constituents in dealing with parties who have provided a product or service in a manner unsatisfactory to the consumer in violation of an applicable law. Also, the [[Better Business Bureau]] is a national [[non-governmental]] organization whose sole agenda is to provide political lobbies and action on behalf of aggrieved consumers.

==Expansion to eight rights==
In 1985, the concept of consumer rights was endorsed by the United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]], which expands them to include eight basic rights.

===The right to satisfaction of basic needs===
This right demands that people have access to basic, essential goods and services: adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water, and sanitation

===The right to redress===
The right to redress provides for consumers to receive a fair settlement of just claims, including compensation for misrepresentation, shoddy goods, or unsatisfactory services. For example, a consumer should be able to go to consumer court against mobile phone companies that put hidden charges on the bill that were not previously explained, or activate ringtones without the consumer's permission.

===The right to consumer education===
The right to consumer education states that consumers should be able to acquire knowledge and skills needed to make informed, confident choices about goods and services, while being aware of basic consumer rights and responsibilities and how to act on them.

===The right to a healthy environment===
This is the right to live and work in a work space or home that is non-threatening to the well-being of present and future generations.

==World Consumer Rights Day==
The [[NGO]] [[Consumers International]] adopted the eight rights and restated them as a charter.&lt;ref name="consumersinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/consumer-rights|title=Consumers International - Who we are - consumer rights|publisher=consumersinternational.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the organization began recognizing the date of Kennedy's speech, March 15, as World Consumer Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-guest/jfk-consumer-rights_b_1347471.html |title=Jim Guest: Fighting for Consumer Rights, Fifty Years After Kennedy's Call |first=Jim |last=Guest |authorlink=James A. Guest |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom provisions==
As of May 2014, the UK Government has introduced proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the "Consumer Rights Bill", and it will consolidate and develop Unfair Contract Terms provisions and Consumer Protection provisions.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/consumer_rights.htm|title=Consumer Rights - Law Commission|publisher=lawcommission.justice.gov.uk|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

A '''curfew''' is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/curfew|title=curfew - definition of curfew in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/curfew|title=Curfew - Define Curfew at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the head of a household to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair|au pair ]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.

== Etymology ==
The word "curfew" comes from the [[French language|French]] phrase "''couvre-feu''", which means "fire cover". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as "curfeu", which later became the modern "curfew".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|curfew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.
# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].
# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a "curfew" time. In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
On 28 January 2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] declared a country-wide military enforced curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-protests-mubarak-army-curfew | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Jack | last1=Shenker | first2=Peter | last2=Beaumont | first3=Sam | last3=Jones | title=Egypt (News),Middle East and North Africa (News) MENA,World news,Hosni Mubarak,Mohamed ElBaradei,Africa (News) | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/29/egypt-jail-break-700-prisoners-escape_n_815872.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Cara | last=Parks | title=Massive Egyptian Prison Break Frees 700 Inmates | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President [[Mohamed Morsi]] who declared a curfew in [[Port Said]], [[Ismaïlia]], and [[Suez]], three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/63539.aspx|title=Suez Canal residents defy President Morsi's curfew|work=ahram.org.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizing football tournaments and street festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323375204578269700878491978|title=Egyptians Defy President's Curfew, as Unrest Spreads|author=Matt Bradley|date=29 January 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew.

===Iceland===
Under [[Iceland|Iceland's]] Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2002080.html "Child Protection",
2002 no. 80 May 10th&lt;/ref&gt;, children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.

Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order. Under the [[State_of_emergency#Sri_Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/5405822.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Wear - Late night youth curfew a success|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government’s ‘Anti-Yob’/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem "[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|title=peak district local history, customs, wildlife, transport - Peakland Heritage|work=peaklandheritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serve their original function.

===United States of America===

====Juvenile curfews====
Curfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.
Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state&lt;ref&gt;[http://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/ Curfews in the State of New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and even by county or municipality. In some cities there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192
|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|title=Curfews » City of Faribault, MN|work=faribault.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034013/http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/juvenile-curfew-laws-arrests/|title="Impact of Juvenile Curfew Laws on Arrests of Youth and Adults" at Journalist's Resource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;https://jjie.org/2013/10/14/op-ed-why-dont-youth-curfews-work/ OP-ED: Why Don’t Youth Curfews Work?, Mike Males | October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/repealing-juvenile-curfew-laws-could-make-cities-safer/ 
Repealing juvenile curfew laws could make cities safer
Jennifer L. DoleacTuesday, December 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/31/the-curfew-myth The Curfew Myth, Ivonne Roman&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also concerns about [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_curfew_data_93_per.html|title=New Orleans curfew data: 93 percent of curfew arrestees are black|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about racial profiling, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514002127/http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mall curfews====
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|title=Upscale Mall Enforces Teen Curfew &amp; Dress Code|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northparkcenter.com/Code-of-Conduct|title=Code of Conduct - NorthPark Center|work=northparkcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies are known as ''mall curfews.'' Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as ''parental escort policies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|title=Parental Escort Policy|work=mallofamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curfews for all====
States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely [[inclement weather]] or [[political dissent|political unrest]]. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as [[elected official]]s, [[law enforcement]] personnel, [[first responder]]s, [[health care]] workers, and the [[mass media]].

In 2015, the city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]].

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration.  That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

===New Zealand===
Curfew laws do not exist in New Zealand and therefore cannot be legally enforced by Police.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">'''Dhammasattha''' "treatise on the law" is the [[Pali]] name of a genre of literature found in the [[Greater India#Indianized kingdoms|Indianized kingdoms]] of Western [[mainland Southeast Asia]] (modern [[Laos]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Yunnan]]) principally written in Pali, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Mon language|Mon]] or the [[Tai languages]] or in a bilingual ''nissaya'' or literal Pali translation ({{lang-my| နိဿယ}}). "Sattha" is the Pali cognate of the [[Sanskrit]] term for instruction, learning, or treatise, [[Shastra|śāstra]]. Burmese {{lang|my|ဓမ္မသတ်}} is often transliterated "dhammathat" and the Tai and Mon terms are typically romanized as "thammasāt" or "dhammasāt" ({{lang-th|ธรรมศาสตร์}}) Dhammasattha texts are historically related to Hindu [[dharmaśāstra]] literature, although they are very significantly influenced by the [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] traditions and literature of Southeast Asia.

==History==
The word ''dhammathat'' is first mentioned in a Burmese inscription from 13th-century [[Bagan]], although it is likely that dhammasattha texts were transmitted there earlier. Certain dhammasatthas claim to have been compiled during the first millennium. There are nine primary Burmese dhammathats, namely the Manu and Dhammavisala Dhammathats of the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the [[Wareru]] Dhammathat&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}} (1270), Pasedha (1468), Dhammathat Kyaw (1581), and Pyanchi Dhammathats (1614)  of the [[Taungoo Dynasty]], and the Myingun Dhammathat (1650) of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myint |first1=Htun |title=Challenges Facing "State" Building in Burma: Law and Legal Dimension |journal= |publisher=Indiana University |pages= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~voconf/papers/myint_voconf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an extensive tradition of dhammasattha exegesis, particularly in [[Myanmar]]. Hundreds of dhammasatth, commentaries, and related legal texts are extant in [[parabaik]] ([[palm-leaf manuscript]]) form.

==Legal history==
Dhammasatths influenced a number of Southeast Asian societies prior to the colonial era in matters concerning marriage, theft, assault, slavery, debt, kingship, property, inheritance as well as other issues. In contemporary [[Burma]], although colonial and post-colonial laws predominate, it remains acceptable practice to use dhammathat in law courts in certain areas of family and inheritance law.

{{FamilyLaw}}
In the [[common law]] tradition, the [[law]] of '''domestic relations''' is a broad category that encompasses:

* [[divorce]];
* [[property settlement]]s;
* [[alimony]], spousal support, or other maintenance;
* the establishment of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]];
* the establishment or termination of [[parent]]al rights;
* [[child support]];
* [[child custody]];
* [[Contact (law)|visitation]]; 
* [[adoption]]; and
* [[Emancipation of minors]].

In some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[guardianship]]s, [[truancy]], and matters related to [[juvenile delinquency]] are considered part of the law of domestic relations.

Many sorts of dispute fall into this broad category; many people who will not otherwise have any dealings during their lives with the judicial system have domestic relations disputes.  Because of the volume of legal business generated by the law of domestic relations, a number of jurisdictions have established specialized [[court]]s of limited jurisdiction, sometimes called ''[[family court]]s'', which hear domestic cases exclusively.

A '''droit''' ([[French language|French]] for ''[[right]]'' or ''[[Law]]'') is a legal title, claim or due.

==Droits of admiralty (English law)==
{{Update-EB|section=yes|date=March 2016}}
The term is used in [[English law]] in the phrase "[[droits of admiralty]]".  This refers to certain customary rights or perquisites, formerly belonging to the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], but now to the crown, for public purposes and paid into the [[Exchequer]]. These ''droits'' (see also [[Shipwreck|wreck]]) consisted of [[flotsam]], [[jetsam]], ligan -  (goods or wreckage on the sea bed that is attached to a buoy so that it can be recovered), [[treasure]], [[deodand]], [[derelict (maritime)]], within the admiral's jurisdiction; all [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]], [[ransom]]s, [[recognizance]]s and pecuniary punishments; all [[sturgeon]]s, [[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[orca|grampuses]] and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at sea, salvage, etc., with the share of prizes such shares being afterwards called "tenths", in imitation of the French, who gave their admiral a ''droit de dixième''. The droits of admiralty were definitely surrendered for the benefit of the public by Prince [[George of Denmark]], when Lord High Admiral of England in 1702. [[American law]] does not recognize any such droits, and the disposition of captured property is regulated by various acts of [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

==Other legal connexions (French law, etc.)==
The term ''droit'' is also used in various legal connexions (i.e., [[French law]]), such as the ''droit'' of [[angary]], the ''droit d'achat'' ([[right of pre-emption]]) in the case of [[contraband]], the [[feudal]] ''droit de bris'' (see wreck), the ''[[droit de regale]]'' or ancient royal privilege of claiming the revenues and patronage of a vacant [[Diocese|bishopric]], and the feudal droites of [[seignory]] generally.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

In French, ''droit'' can mean ''the whole body of the [[Law]]'', as in the motto "[[dieu et mon droit]]," which is to say "God and my whole body of Law."  ''Droit d'auteur'' is a term for [[French copyright law]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A liability insurance company's '''duty to settle''' is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt "in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Ins. Code}} [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ins&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=790-790.15 § 790.03(h)(5)].&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Typical language is: "We may, at our discretion, investigate any ‘occurrence' and settle any claim or 'suit' that may result." {{sm|Peter J. Kalis et al., Policyholder's Guide to the Law of Insurance Coverage}} F-15 (Aspen Publishers Online 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In California, "an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13974532515441078311&amp;q=comunale&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Comunale v. Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co.], 50 Cal. 2d 654, 659–61 (1958) (ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; A rationale for this duty is that "[w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11597490784555170138&amp;q=merritt+reserve&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co.], 34 Cal. App. 3d 858, 870 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; "An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk. Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&amp;q=johansen+cal&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Johansen v. California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau], 15 Cal. 3d 9, 15-16 (1975) (citations and ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12734399634269452649&amp;q=kinder+western&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Kinder v. Western Pioneer Ins. Co.], 231 Cal. App. 2d 894, 901 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14859133972975123124&amp;q=aguerre&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Aguerre, Inc. v. American Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co.], 59 Cal. App. 4th 6, 15 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

An insurer may not "discriminate in its claims settlement practices based upon" certain protected classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Code Regs}} [http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm § 2695.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Program''' (ELSSCAP) is an organization at [[Emory Law School]] dedicated to representing clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Formed in 2010, the project joined a growing class of [[Supreme Court Clinic]]s that provide expert representation under the guidance of experienced litigators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/rlazarus/docs/articles/Lazarus_YaleLJOnlineFinalPublishedArticle.pdf Docket Capture at the High Court]&lt;/ref&gt; ELSSCAP principally represents clients on petitions for writ of [[certiorari]], in opposition to certiorari, on the merits, or as [[amicus curiae]]. The program was founded by Professor David J. Bederman and Kedar Bhatia, then a first-year law student and now a contributor on [[SCOTUSblog|SCOTUSBlog.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/advocates/b/d/david_jeremy_bederman Oyez Profile for David J.

ELSSCAP filed four amicus briefs and two petitions for writ of certiorari in its first year. It has been recognized for its public service efforts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html Supreme Court Advocacy Project Receives Award for Amicus Brief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014024/http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html |date=2012-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and profiled in the National Law Journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202513674758 Brief of the Week: Student Counsel]&lt;/ref&gt; for an amicus brief&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailywrit.com/blog/uploads/2011/08/10-945_tsac_Medical_Society_of_New_Jersey.pdf Brief of the Medical Society of New Jersey, et al.]&lt;/ref&gt; it filed in [[Florence v.

On October 29, 2012, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the fourth case taken by the group, Bullock v. BankChampaign N.A.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1518.htm Docket: Bullock v. BankChampaign, N.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSSCAP is run by an annually elected student Executive Board. The current Director for the 2015-2016 school year is DeWitt Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Program (ELSSCAP) {{!}} Emory University School of Law {{!}} Atlanta, GA|url = http://law.emory.edu/academics/academic-programs/elsscap.html|website = Emory University School of Law|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other board member positions include Deputy Director, Director of Operations, Director of Case Services, Director of Marketing, Director of Outreach, Director of Membership, Executive Editor, and 1L Representative.

== Case Application Process ==
Prospective clients may submit claims for consideration on ELSSCAP's website.  Once submitted, the Executive Board will consider whether to accept the case.

{{legal status}}
In [[Customary international law|customary]] [[international law]], an '''enemy [[alien (law)|alien]]''' is any native, citizen, denizen or subject of any foreign nation or government with which a domestic nation or government is in conflict and who are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed.   Usually, but not always, the countries are in a state of declared war.

==United Kingdom==
At the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, the United Kingdom had become a place of refuge for people who had fled Nazi persecution, including Jews and political refugees. At first, the authorities [[Defence Regulation 18B|interned]] these refugees with other enemy residents, without distinction. Later on, when Italy also declared war, significant numbers of Italian residents were also interned.

The [[Isle of Man]], relatively isolated from the British mainland and with a useful amount of holiday accommodation, was used to provide housing for the "Alien Civilians" (as it had in World War I). There were also efforts to move internees from Britain. In July, 1940, the ''[[Arandora Star]]'' was torpedoed and sunk while transporting Italian and German aliens to North America; 743 died, including prisoners, crew and guards. The 813 surviving prisoners were subsequently included in the 2,500 men transported by [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']] for internment in [[Hay, New South Wales]].

The [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]] was apparently the only British unit that enemy aliens could serve in early in the war. Many thousands of Germans and Austrians joined the Pioneer Corps to assist the Allied war efforts and liberation of their home countries. These were mainly Jews and political opponents of the Nazi Regime who had fled to Britain while it was still possible, and included the cinematographer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]] and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. These men - often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens" - later moved on to serve in fighting units. Some were recruited by [[Special Operations Executive]] (S.O.E.) as secret agents. They were instructed to choose an "English" name using their old initials.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as German nationals in the British forces was particularly dangerous, since, in case of taken captive, with a high probability they would have been executed as traitors by the Germans. Also, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their profound knowledge of the German language and customs proved useful. Many of them served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeochannel.co.uk/programmes/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|Japanese-American internment|German-American internment|Italian-American internment}}
A well-known example of enemy aliens were the Japanese citizens residing in the United States during [[World War II]]. Many of these Japanese and Japanese Americans were imprisoned in [[Internment|internment camps]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] during wartime, alongside many German- and Italian-Americans. However, many [[Nisei#American Nisei|Japanese Americans]] and Italian-Americans were not actually "aliens", as they held American citizenship. The term "enemy alien" referred only to non-American citizens who were nationals of [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries. Included in this number were thousands of resident aliens who were prohibited from applying for citizenship by [[Naturalization Act of 1870|race-based naturalization laws]]; when war was declared against their native countries, their status changed from "resident" to "enemy" alien.  Therefore, German American, Italian American and Japanese American permanent residents were classified as enemy aliens and interned as such. In total 10,905 Italian Americans and approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned in many different camps and sites across the country.  German Americans were held in more than 50 different locations. 
[[Image:German_American_internment_sites_during_World_War_II.jpg|thumb|center]]

Citizens of an enemy country who lived in the USA during World War II were required to have an "Enemy Alien" card and register monthly with the authorities.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ex post facto'' law}}
An '''''ex post facto'' law''' (corrupted from {{Lang-la|ex postfacto|lit=out of the aftermath}}) is a [[law]] that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In [[criminal law]], it may [[Criminalization|criminalize]] actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a [[crime]] by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the [[punishment]] prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the [[rules of evidence]] in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. Conversely, a form of ''ex post facto'' law commonly called an ''[[amnesty law]]'' may decriminalize certain acts. A [[pardon]] has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term '''''in mitius'''''.

Some [[common law|common-law]] [[jurisdiction]]s do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new [[precedent]] generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. ''Ex post facto'' laws are expressly forbidden by the [[United States Constitution]] in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the [[Westminster system]] of government, such as the [[United Kingdom]], ''ex post facto'' laws are technically possible, because the doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] allows [[Parliament]] to pass any law it wishes. In a nation with an entrenched [[bill of rights]] or a written [[constitution]], ''ex post facto'' legislation may be prohibited.

While American jurisdictions generally prohibit ''ex post facto'' laws, European countries apply the principle of '''''lex mitior''''' ("the milder law"). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that ''ex post facto'' laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westen|first1=Peter|work=New Criminal Law Review: An International and Interdisciplinary Journal|title=Lex Mitior: Converse of ex post facto and window into criminal desert|date=May 2015|pages=167–213|doi=10.1525/nclr.2015.18.2.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ex post facto'' laws by country==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has no strong constitutional prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws, although narrowly retroactive laws might violate the constitutional [[separation of powers]] principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption that they do not apply retroactively.

Retroactive laws designed to prosecute what was perceived to have been a blatantly unethical means of [[tax avoidance]] were passed in the early 1980s by the [[Fraser Government|Fraser government]] (see [[Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance]]). Similarly, legislation [[criminalization|criminalising]] certain war crimes retroactively has been held to be constitutional (see ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'').

The government will sometimes make a press release that it intends to change the tax law with effect from the date and time of the press release, before legislation is introduced into parliament.

===Brazil===
According to the 5th Article, section XXXVI of the Brazilian Constitution, laws cannot have ''ex post facto'' effects that affect acquired rights, accomplished juridical acts and ''res judicata''.

The same article in section XL prohibits ''ex post facto'' [[criminal law]]s. Like France, there is an exception when retroactive criminal laws benefit the accused person.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], ''ex post facto'' criminal laws are constitutionally prohibited by [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|paragraph 11(g)]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Also, under paragraph 11(i) of the Charter, if the punishment for a crime has varied between the time the crime was committed and the time of sentencing following a conviction, the convicted person is entitled to the lesser punishment.

The Canada sex offender registry, which went into effect on December 15, 2004, is somewhat retroactive. When the registry was created, all offenders who were on the Ontario sex offender registry, which was created in 2001, were required to register on the national registry. In addition, sex offenders in all provinces who were serving a sentence (whether imprisoned or on probation or parole) on December 15,2004 were required to register, regardless of when their offense and conviction occurred. However, the registry was not retroactive to anybody who had completed their sentence by late 2004 and was not on the Ontario registry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-national-embarrassment/&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian courts have never ruled on the somewhat retroactive nature of the sex offender registry, since this seems to have never been challenged. 

Sex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. &lt;ref&gt;https://doubleaspect.blog/tag/sex-offender-registration/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-national-embarrassment/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/40-3/bill/S-2/royal-assent/page-ToC&lt;/ref&gt;. Somewhat bizarrely, sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004 who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15, 2004 and January 1, 2011. 

Because section 11 of the Charter is among the sections that can be overridden under [[Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]] (the notwithstanding clause), Parliament could in theory enact ''ex post facto'' laws by invoking section 33. However, the federal Parliament (which has the sole power to enact laws punishable for violation by two years or more in penitentiary) has never attempted to enact an ''ex post facto'' law (or any other law) using section 33.

It should be emphasized that the Charter prohibition applies only to criminal law. Changes to [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] in Canada can be, and occasionally are, enacted ''ex post facto''. In one example, convicted murderer [[Colin Thatcher]] was ordered to forfeit proceeds from a book he had published (after being paroled from prison) under a [[Saskatchewan]] law. Although the law was passed long after Thatcher's murder conviction, the courts have ruled that such laws prescribe only [[civil penalty|civil penalties]] (as opposed to additional criminal penalties) and are thus not subject to Charter restrictions.

===Finland===
Generally, the Finnish legal system does not permit ''ex post facto'' laws, especially those that would expand criminal responsibility. They are not expressly forbidden; instead, the ban is derived from more general legal principles and basic rights. In civil matters, such as taxation, ''ex post facto'' laws may be made in some circumstances.

However, there have been three exceptional instances when ''ex post facto'' criminal laws have been used in Finland.

Following the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918, the [[Parliament of Finland]] passed a law setting up tribunals to try suspected rebels. These tribunals issued death sentences in many cases, although very few of those accused could have committed a crime that carried the [[Capital punishment in Finland|death penalty]] under Finnish law in force during the war. Several hundred people were executed under what was arguably an ''ex post facto'' legal arrangement. During the war, and before the tribunals were set up, thousands of people had been executed without trial by both sides.

After [[World War II]], Finland was under pressure to convict political leaders whom the Allied powers considered responsible for Finnish involvement in the war. An ''ex post facto'' law was passed in the autumn of 1945 to permit [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|prosecution for war responsibility]], and eventually eight politicians were convicted.

In another post-war case, the [[Weapons Cache Case|weapons cache case]], an ''ex post facto'' law was passed in 1947 so that military personnel could be prosecuted for unofficially preparing for guerrilla resistance in case of Soviet occupation.

===France===
In [[France]], so-called "''lois rétroactives''" (retroactive laws) are technically prohibited by Article 2 of the [[Code Civil]], which states that: "Legislation provides only for the future; it has no retrospective operation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/1950/13681/version/3/file/Code_22.pdf Link to Civil Code]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice however, since the Code Civil does not have the status of constitutional legislation and can therefore be overruled by subsequent laws, the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] has determined that retroactive laws can be passed within certain limits – such as in the case of financial or tax legislation –, particularly where it is considered to be in the "general interest"; this has been demonstrated by a series of decisions handed down by the Conseil Constitutionnel concerning retroactive tax laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/a-la-une/janvier-2013-la-retroactivite-fiscale-dans-la-jurisprudence-du-conseil-constitutionnel.135573.html| title=Janvier 2013 : La rétroactivité fiscale dans la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel| language=French| date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in criminal law, ''ex post facto'' sanctions are effectively forbidden as per Article 112-1 of the [[French Penal Code]], except in cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person (called retroactivity "[[in mitius]]").&lt;ref name = Soyer&gt;{{cite book| last = Soyer| first = Jean-Claude| title = Droit pénal et procédure pénale| publisher = L.G.D.G.| series = Lextenso Editions| edition = 21| date = 2012| location = Paris| pages = 75–78| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considered unconstitutional, since the principle of non-retroactivity is laid down in Article 8 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which has constitutional status under French law.&lt;ref name="Terré"&gt;{{cite book| last = Terré| first = François| title = Introduction générale au droit| publisher = Dalloz| series = Précis| edition = 8| date = 2001 | location = Paris| pages = 204–5| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[épuration légale]]'' trials held after the 1944 [[liberation of France]] introduced the status of ''[[indignité nationale]]'' for [[Nazi collaborators]] as a way to avoid ''ex post facto'' law.

===Germany===
Article 103 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German basic law]] requires that an act may be punished only if it has already been punishable by law at the time it was committed (specifically: by ''written'' law, [[Germany]] following civil law).

[[Robert A. Taft]], at the time a U.S. Senator from Ohio, asserted that the [[Nuremberg Trials]] following [[World War II]] were based on ''ex post facto'' law because the Allies did not negotiate the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter]], which defined crimes against humanity and created the International Military Tribunal, until well after the acts charged. Others, including the International Military Tribunal, argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], and the various [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The problem of ''ex post facto'' law was also relevant in the 1990s as there was a discussion about the trials against East German soldiers who killed fugitives on the Inner-German border ([[Schießbefehl#After reunification|''Mauerschützen-Prozesse'']] - ''Wall-shooters'/ -guards' trials''). German courts in these cases recurred to the [[Radbruch formula]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Lahusen [http://www.zeit.de/2009/46/A-Radbruch/komplettansicht "Aus Juristen Demokraten machen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In 2010, the parliament established a 98% punitive tax on any income over two million forints received either as a retirement package or as severance pay in the previous five years in the government sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realdeal.hu/20101109/controversial-98-tax-on-govt-severance-pay-made-retroactive-to-2005 Controversial 98% tax on gov't severance pay made retroactive to 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111025059/http://www.realdeal.hu/20101109/controversial-98-tax-on-govt-severance-pay-made-retroactive-to-2005 |date=November 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India, without using the expression "''ex post facto law''", the underlying principle has been adopted in the article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution in the following words:
{{quote|No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence.}}

Further, what article 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an ''ex post facto'' law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point; whereas in the United States, an ''ex post facto'' law is in itself invalid, it is not so in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l60-Protection-against-ex-post-facto-laws.html legalserviceindia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example for retrospective law in India is the Karnataka Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karunadu.gov.in/karigr/actsrules/otheracts/scst.htm Department of Stamps and Registration, Government of Karnataka]&lt;/ref&gt; in the state of [[Karnataka]].

===Indonesia===
The [[Indonesia]]n constitution prohibits trying citizens under retroactive laws in any circumstance. This was tested in 2004 when the conviction of [[Masykur Abdul Kadir]], one of the [[2002 Bali terrorist bombing|Bali bombers]], under retroactive anti-terrorist legislation was quashed.&lt;ref&gt;Indonesian Constitutional Court Decision No 013/PUU-I/2003 (Masykur Abdul Kadir Case)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
''Ex post facto'' laws, in all contexts, are prohibited by Article 169 (Chapter 11) of [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's constitution]].

===Republic of Ireland===
The imposition of retroactive criminal sanctions is prohibited by Article 15.5.1° of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. Retroactive changes of the civil law have also been found to violate the constitution when they would have resulted in the loss in a right to damages before the courts, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Irish Supreme Court]] having found that such a right is a constitutionally protected property right.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] enacted the 1950 "Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law" for the purpose of punishing acts that occurred during the [[Second World War]], when Israel did not exist as a state. The law was used to punish [[Adolf Eichmann]] and others.

===Italy===
Article 25, paragraph 2, of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]], establishing that "nobody can be punished but according to a law come into force before the deed was committed", prohibits indictment pursuant a retroactive law. Article 11 of preliminary provisions to the [[Italian civil code|Italian Civil Code]] and Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of taxpayer's rights, prohibit retroactive laws on principle: such provisions can be derogated, however, by acts having force of the ordinary law; on the contrary, non-retroactivity in criminal law is thought absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/10805861/Irretroattività_della_norma_penale_e_redazione_legislativa Giampiero Buonomo, {{lang|it|Dura lex sed negligens}}, in Mondoperaio, 9/2014, p. 61.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Article 39 of the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] of [[Japan]] prohibits the retroactive application of laws. Article 6 of [[Criminal Code of Japan]] further states that if a new law comes into force after the deed was committed, the lighter punishment must be given.

===Lithuania===
Lithuania has no constitutional prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws. Retroactive criminal sanctions are prohibited by Article 2, Part 1 (Chapter 1) of the [[Criminal Code]] of the [[Republic of Lithuania]]. Retroactive administrative sanctions are prohibited by Article 8 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Lithuania.

Lithuanian lawyer Dainius Žalimas contends that there has been retroactive application of the law on Genocide (and subsequently adopted articles of the Criminal Code) against participants in Soviet repressions against Lithuanian guerilla fighters and their supporters, and gives examples of such decisions. The Article 99 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania was introduced only in September 26, 2000 and therefore can't be used in events of 1944-1953.

===Mexico===
According to the first and second paragraphs of the Article 14th of the Mexican Constitution, retroactive application of the law is prohibited if it is on detriment of a person rights. But the new law can be applied if it benefits the person.

===Netherlands===
Article 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that "The law has no retroactive effect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001833#Artikel4 Article 4 Wet algemene bepalingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the "most favorable" (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/EersteBoek/TitelI/Artikel1 Article 1 Wetboek van Strafrecht (Criminal Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Civil Law there is no such provision.

===New Zealand===
Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates that enactments do not have retrospective effect. The [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] also affirms New Zealand's commitment to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], with section 26 preventing the application of retroactive penalties. This is further reinforced under section 6(1) of the current Sentencing Act 2002 which provides, "[p]enal enactments not to have retrospective effect to disadvantage of offender" irrespective of any provision to the contrary.

Section 26 of the Bill of Rights and the previous sentencing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1985, caused significant digression among judges when the [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand Parliament]] introduced legislation that had the effect of enacting a retrospective penalty for crimes involving an element of home invasion. Ultimately, the discrepancy was restricted with what some labelled artificial logic in the cases of ''R v Pora'' and ''R v Poumako''.

===Norway===
Article 97 of the [[constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]] prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect. The prohibition applies to both criminal and civil laws, but in some civil cases, only particularly unreasonable effects of retroactivity will be found unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norwegian Supreme Court case 2009/1575 |url=http://www.domstol.no/upload/HRET/saknr2009-1663-plenum.pdf |publisher=domstol.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Article 12 of the constitution of Pakistan prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect by stating:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html The Constitution of Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12.1 - No law shall authorize the punishment of a person:-
* 12.1.a - for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission; or
* 12.1.b - for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the offence was committed.

===Philippines===
The 1987 Constitution of the [[Philippines]] categorically prohibits the passing of any ''ex post facto'' law. Article III ([[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]), Section 22 specifically states: "No ''ex post facto'' law or [[bill of attainder]] shall be enacted."

However, the [[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012|Cybercrime Prevention Act]], which went into effect on October 3, 2012, is criticized for being ''ex post facto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By the time you read this, I will be a criminal.|url=http://nissie.tumblr.com/post/32744104468/by-the-time-you-read-this-i-will-be-a-criminal|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Retroactive application of law is prohibited by the Article 3 of the Polish [[civil code]], and the [[legal rule]] prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a [[Latin]] sentence ''Lex retro non agit'' ("A law does not apply retroactively"). The said article, however, allows retroactive application of an Act of Parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose.

===Portugal===
Article 18 of the Portuguese constitution forbids the retroactive application of any law the restricts right; article 29 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids retroactive application of criminal law; article 103 forbids the application of retroactive taxes.

===Romania===
Article 15 (2) of the Romanian constitution provides that the law shall only act for the future, except for the more favourable criminal or administrative law.

===Russia===
''Ex post facto'' punishment in criminal and administrative law is prohibited by article 54 of the constitution; ''ex post facto'' tax laws by article 57 of the constitution.

===Spain===
Article 9.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution]] guarantees the principle of non-retroactivity of punitive provisions that are not favorable to or restrictive of individual rights. Therefore, "ex post facto" criminal laws or any other retroactive punitive provisions are constitutionally prohibited.

As well as [[Statute law]] mentioned above, this now also includes '[[Precedent|court-made law]]'. The [[Parot doctrine (Spain)|Parot doctrine]], in which terrorists were denied the right (enshrined in a 1973 Statute) to earn a reduction in the length of their sentences by a Spanish court ruling in 2006 was judged by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] to be contrary to relevant articles on [[ECHR#Article 7 - retroactivity|retroactivity]] &amp; [[ECHR#Article 5 - liberty and security|liberty and security]] in 2013.

===South Africa===
Section 35(3) of the [[South African Bill of Rights]] prohibits ''ex post facto'' criminal laws, except that acts which violated international law at the time they were committed may be prosecuted even if they were not illegal under national law at the time. It also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], retroactive penal sanctions and other retroactive legal effects of criminal acts due the State are prohibited by chapter 2, section 10 of the [[Constitution of Sweden#Instrument of Government|Instrument of Government]] (''Regeringsformen''). Retroactive taxes or charges are not prohibited, but they can have retroactive effect reaching back only to the time when a new tax bill was proposed by the government. The retroactive effect of a tax or charge thus reaches from that time until the bill is passed by the parliament.

As the [[Swedish Act of Succession]] was changed in 1979, and the throne was inherited regardless of sex, the inheritance right was withdrawn from all the descendants of [[Charles XIV John]] (king 1818-44) except the current king [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Thereby, the heir-apparent title was transferred from the new-born [[Prince Carl Philip]] to his older sister [[Crown Princess Victoria]].

The Swedish Parliament voted in 2004 to abolish [[inheritance tax]] by January 1, 2005. However, in 2005 they retro-actively decided to move the date to December 17, 2004. The main reason was abolishing inheritance tax for the many Swedish victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which took place on December 26.

===Turkey===
''Ex post facto'' punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]] of [[Turkey]]. It states:
* c1. No one shall be punished for any act which does not constitute a criminal offence under the law in force at the time committed; no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed.
* c2. The provisions of the above paragraph shall also apply to the statute of limitations on offences and penalties and on the results of conviction.
Thus, the article does not prohibit ''in mitius'' laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''ex post facto'' laws are frowned upon,{{by whom|date=June 2018}} but are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]]. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were ''ex post facto'' legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Some laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the [[Pakistan Act 1990]] (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] having re-admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that "This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989", nine months before it was enacted.&lt;ref name=NA_PA1990 &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/14/section/2 |title= Pakistan Act 1990 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective ''criminal'' laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but several noted legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Macarthys Ltd v Smith [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in {{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Josephine | first2 = Lorna | last2 = Woods | first3 = Christian | last3 = Twigg-Flesner | title = EU Law | edition = 9th | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927959-3|chapter=Section 4.4.2: Effect of the European Communities Act 1972, s.2(1) and (4) |quote=If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it — and says so in express terms — then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament. |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeuleg/38-xiv/5020802.htm| title = Select Committee on European Scrutiny Minutes of Evidence: Examination of Witnesses (Questions 229-239): Rt hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Frost| accessdate =2008-01-09 | first = Jack |last = Straw | authorlink = Jack Straw | date = 2005-02-08| work = House of Commons Publications |quote = I think your Committee will be familiar with what Lord Denning, then Master of the Rolls, said in McCarthy v Smith: "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision of it or with the intention of acting inconsistently with it—it says so in express terms—I should have thought it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute in our Parliament." That much is clear. Other consequences would follow in those circumstances, which arise from our signature on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty, Article 27, which says that you have to respect the international obligations into which you have entered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[War Crimes Act 1991]] created an ''ex post facto'' jurisdiction of British courts over [[war crime]]s committed during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is [[Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate]], which retrospectively changed the law on compensation resulting from [[scorched earth]] actions in Burma during the war. The decision of the courts was overriden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965. More recently, the [[Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011]] retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.

One example of an ex post facto criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is “new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence” that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8982608/Stephen-Lawrence-murder-change-in-double-jeopardy-law-allowed-Gary-Dobson-prosecution.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow [[tax avoidance]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8496921.stm | work=BBC News | title=Will retrospective taxes affect us all? | date=5 February 2010 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most significant example known concerns Double-taxation Treaty Arrangements where the [[Finance Act 2008]] with [[BN66]] retrospectively amended 1987 legislation creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before. More recently, the so called "[[2019 Loan Charge]]", coming in from 5 April 2019 and going back 20 years retrospectively has triggered an Early Day Motion [https://www.parliament.uk/edm/2017-19/1239] in UK Parliament and the establishment of a Loan Charge Action [https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/ Group]. It has since transpired that Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General Her Majesty's Treasury, misled UK Parliament stating that “the arrangements entered into by those who are in scope of this measure [the 2019 Loan Charge] were not legal when they were entered into, even though they may have been entered into in the past”. The Loan Charge Action Group has since [https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/blog/lcag-letter-to-mel-stride-mp-03-07-18 written to demand a formal apology and correction of parliamentary record].

===United States===
{{rquote|right|The sentiment that ''ex post facto'' laws are against natural right is so strong in the United States, that few, if any, of the State constitutions have failed to proscribe them. The federal constitution indeed interdicts them in criminal cases only; but they are equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases, and the omission of a caution which would have been right, does not justify the doing what is wrong. Nor ought it to be presumed that the legislature meant to use a phrase in an unjustifiable sense, if by rules of construction it can be ever strained to what is just.| [[Thomas Jefferson]] | Letter to Isaac McPherson, August 13, 1813 }}
In the [[United States]], Congress is prohibited from passing ''ex post facto'' laws by clause 3 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. The states are prohibited from passing ''ex post facto'' laws by clause 1 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Section 10]]. This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] described them as "equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases". Over the years, however, when deciding ''ex post facto'' cases, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has referred repeatedly to its ruling in ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'', in which Justice [[Samuel Chase]] held that the prohibition applied only to criminal matters, not civil matters, and established four categories of unconstitutional ''ex post facto'' laws.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Calder v. Bull]]'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case dealt with the Article I, Section 10, prohibition on ''ex post facto'' laws, because it concerned a Connecticut state law.

Not all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a retroactive effect is the [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] of 2006. This law imposes new registration requirements on convicted [[sex offenders]] and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.4472: |title=Library of Congress text of H.R.4472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Smith v. Doe]]'' (2003) that forcing sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against ''ex post facto'' laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|538|84|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/constitution/article-1/59-ex-post-facto-laws.html |title=Ex Post Facto Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections'', the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma found the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORA, to be punitive in nature, if not in intent. While the law in question has been ruled as not being retroactive in nature, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had been applying the new legislation retroactively, and "also find the Department's retroactive application of the level assignment provisions of 57 O.S. Supp. 2007, 582.1 - 582.5, as amended, violates the ex post facto clause."&lt;ref&gt;''Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections'', 2013 OK 43 (2013), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Starkey%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,226&amp;case=1906264459000731549&amp;scilh=0]; OSCN Documents http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=470336&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy has also arisen with regard to [[sexually violent predator laws|sexually violent predator (SVP) laws]], which allow the indefinite commitment of a person with a mental abnormality which predisposes them to molest children. This issue arose in the case ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]''.&lt;ref name="Hendricks"&gt;''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', {{ussc|521|346|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hendricks'', a man with a long history of sexually molesting children was scheduled to be released from prison shortly after the enactment of Kansas's SVP act. Rather than being released, he was committed on the grounds that he had a mental abnormality. Hendricks contested the law on ''ex post facto'' and double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Kansas invalidated the Act, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision and ruled that the law was constitutional on the basis that the law did not impose a criminal punishment.&lt;ref name="Hendricks" /&gt;

Another example is the [[Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban]], where firearms prohibitions were imposed on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders (which do not require criminal conviction). These individuals can now be sentenced to up to ten years in a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] for possession of a firearm, regardless of whether the weapon was legally possessed when the law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Uscsub|18|922|g|8}}, {{Uscsub2|18|922|g|9}}, and {{Uscsub2|18|924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been legally upheld because it is considered regulatory, not punitive; it is a [[status offense]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Emerson]]'', 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in ''Calder v. Bull'', the court expressly stated that a law that "mollifies" a criminal act was merely retrospective, and was not an ''ex post facto'' law.&lt;ref&gt;''Calder'', 3 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have argued that, as a historical matter, the phrase ''ex post facto'' referred to civil as well as criminal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoldan|first1=Evan|title=The Civil Ex Post Facto Clause|ssrn=2469141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States administrative law|administrative law]], federal agencies may apply their rules retroactively if Congress has authorized them to; otherwise, retroactive application is generally prohibited. Retroactive application of regulations is disfavored by the courts for several reasons. The courts uphold retroactive regulation where Congress has expressly granted such retroactive power to the agency, as they did in ''Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital'', {{ussc|488|204|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment by international organizations and treaties==

===International criminal law===
In [[international criminal law]], the [[Nuremberg trials]] prosecuted [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] perpetrated in World War II. Although the [[Nuremberg Charter]], the [[procedural law]] under which the trials were held, postdated [[V-E Day]], the tribunal rejected the defence that the criminal law was ''ex post facto'', arguing it derived from earlier treaties like the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. The [[International Criminal Court]] established in 2002 cannot prosecute crimes committed before 2002.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties===
Article 11, paragraph 2 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that no person be held guilty of any criminal law that did not exist at the time of offence nor suffer any penalty heavier than what existed at the time of offence. It does however permit application of either domestic or international law.

Very similar provisions are found in Article 15, paragraph 1 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], replacing the term "penal offence" with "criminal offence". It also adds that if a lighter penalty is provided for after the offence occurs, that lighter penalty shall apply retroactively. Paragraph 2 adds a provision that paragraph 1 does not prevent trying and punishing for an act that was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. Specifically addressing the use of the death penalty, article 6, paragraph 2 provides in relevant part that a death sentence may only be imposed "for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime".

===African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights===
Article 2, paragraph 7 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] provides in part that "[n]o one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offense at the time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offense for which no provision was made at the time it was committed."

===American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man===
Article 25 of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] provides in part that "[n]o person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing law." The right to be tried in accordance to "pre-existing law" is reiterated in article 26.

===Arab Charter on Human Rights===
Article 15 of the [[Arab Charter on Human Rights]] provides that "[n]o crime and no penalty can be established without a prior provision of the law. In all circumstances, the law most favorable to the defendant shall be applied."

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Effectively all European states (except [[Belarus]]), including all [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]] states, are bound by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 7 of the convention]] mirrors the language of both paragraphs of Article 15 of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, with the exception that it does not include that a subsequent lighter penalty must apply.

==Grammatical form and usage==
The phrase may not appear to be grammatically correct in Latin if it is interpreted to comprise the [[preposition]] ''ex'', the preposition ''post'', and a [[noun]] with the wrong [[grammatical case]] to agree with ''post''. Indeed, the ''Digesta Iustiniani'' (15.3.10.8.3, 20.1.22.pr2, etc.) shows a two-word phrase, ''ex postfacto'': ''out of a postfactum (an after-deed)'', or more naturally, ''from a law passed afterward''. This same work, however, also makes use of the three-word phrase ''ex post facto'', (2.14.17.4.2, 4.6.17.1.1, ''passim''), suggesting that ''post'' might best be understood as an adverb. This adverbial usage of ''post'' is not at all unusual. For example, the Classical author/advocate/politician [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] employs phrases such as ''multis post annis'' (''De Re Publica'' 2.5.8 and elsewhere).

Therefore, ''ex post facto'' or ''ex postfacto'' is natively an adverbial phrase, a usage demonstrated by the sentence "He was convicted ''ex post facto'' (from a law passed after his crime)." The law itself would rightfully be a ''postfactum'' law (''lex postfacta''); nevertheless, despite its redundant or circular nature, the phrase ''an ex post facto law'' is used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010 }}

In Poland the phrase ''[[:pl:Lex retro non agit|lex retro non agit]]'' ("the law does not operate retroactively") is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattila|first=Heikki E.

{{Prerogative writs}}
'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it. Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.

===Pakistan===
Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

==Equivalent remedies==
===Biscay===
In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed.

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an Aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his Aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest.

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol I.

Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

'''Immigration law''' refers to the national [[statute]]s, [[Primary and secondary legislation|regulations]], and [[Precedent|legal precedents]] governing [[immigration]] into and [[deportation]] from a [[country]]. Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalization]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in [[commerce]] or [[government]].

National laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates&lt;ref&gt;art 12(4)&lt;/ref&gt; that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.

==Control measures==
To control immigration, many countries set up customs at entry points.  Some common location for entry points are airports and roads near the border.  At the customs department, [[travel document]]s are inspected.  Some required documents are a [[passport]], an [[Carte Jaune|international certificate of vaccination]] and an [[onward ticket]].  Sometimes travelers are also required to declare or register the amount of money they are carrying.

==Comparison of immigration visa categories by country or territory==
&lt;!-- Comment - TBD --&gt;

'''''Imperium''''' is a [[Latin]] word that, in a broad sense, translates roughly as '[[Power (philosophy)|power]] to command'. In [[ancient Rome]], different kinds of power or [[authority]] were distinguished by different terms. ''Imperium'' referred to the ability of an individual to command the military.  It is not to be confused with ''[[auctoritas]]'' or ''[[potestas]]'', different and generally inferior types of power in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Primarily used to refer to the power that is wielded, in greater or lesser degree, by an individual to whom it is delegated, the term could also be used with a geographical connotation, designating the territorial limits of that ''imperium''. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] or [[promagistrate]]s. These included the curule [[aedile]], the [[praetor]], the [[Roman consul|consul]], the [[magister equitum]], and the [[Roman dictator|dictator]].

== Personal characteristic ==
In ancient Rome, ''imperium'' could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, the wealth held in items, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society it was also a more formal concept of [[legal authority]]. A man with ''imperium'' ("[[imperator]]") had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his [[magistrate|magistracy]] or [[promagistrate|promagistracy]]. He could be [[veto]]ed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g. a fellow [[Roman consul|consul]]) or by one whose ''imperium'' outranked his - that is, one of ''imperium maius'' (greater ''imperium).''

Some modern [[scholar]]s such as [[A.H.M. Jones]] have defined ''imperium'' as "the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state".{{cn|date=December 2015}}

''Imperium'' can be distinguished from [[Monarchy|''regnum'']], or royal power, which was inherited. ''Imperium'' was originally a [[military]] concept, the power of the ''[[imperator]]'' (general in the army) to command. The word derives from the Latin verb, ''imperare'' (to command). The title ''imperator'' was applied to the emperor, who was the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word, ''imperator'', gives us the English word "emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of the word emperor|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/emperor|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Imperium'' was indicated in two prominent ways. A ''[[curule]]'' magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office (compare the [[field marshal]]'s baton). Any such magistrate was also escorted by ''[[lictor]]s'' bearing the ''[[fasces]]'' (traditional symbols of imperium and authority); when outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', axes were added to the ''fasces'' to indicate an imperial magistrate's power to enact capital punishment outside Rome (the axes were removed within the ''pomerium''). The number of lictors in [[attendance]] upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of ''imperium''. When in the field, a ''curule'' magistrate possessing an ''imperium'' greater or equal to that of a [[praetor]] wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his [[cuirass]]. Further, any man executing ''imperium'' within his sphere of influence was entitled to the [[curule chair]].

* Curule [[aedile]] (''aedilis curulis'') – 2 lictors
** Since a plebeian aedile (aedilis plebis) did not own imperium, he was not escorted by lictors.
* [[Magister equitum]] (the [[Roman dictator|dictator]]'s deputy) – 6 lictors
* [[Praetor]] – 6 lictors (2 lictors within the pomerium)
* [[Roman consul|Consul]] – 12 lictors each
* [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] – 24 lictors outside the Pomerium and 12 inside; starting from the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Lucius Sulla]] the latter rule was ignored.
** Because the dictator could enact capital punishment within Rome as well as without, his lictors did not remove the axes from their fasces within the pomerium.

As can be seen, dictatorial ''imperium'' was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian ''imperium'' was superior to "equine-magisterial" ''imperium''. A [[promagistrate]], or a man executing a ''curule'' office without actually holding that office, also possessed ''imperium'' in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular ''imperium'' being more or less equal to consular ''imperium'', propraetorian ''imperium'' to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of ''lictors''.

Certain extraordinary [[Commissioned officer|commissions]], such as [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]]'s famous command against the [[Piracy|pirates]], were invested with ''imperium maius'' meaning they outranked all other owners of imperium of the same type or rank (in Pompey's case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being "ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland"). ''Imperium maius'' later became a hallmark of the [[Roman emperor]].

Another technical use of the term in [[Roman law]] was for the power to extend the [[law]] beyond its mere interpretation, extending ''imperium'' from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their [[delegate]]s to the [[jurisprudence]] of [[jurisconsult]]s.

==Later==
While the Byzantine [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Roman Emperors]] retained full Roman imperium and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between ''sacerdotium'' in the person of the Pope and the secular ''imperium'' of the revived Western Roman Emperor since Charlemagne. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city Rome: the Pope, Bishop ''of Rome'', versus the Holy ''Roman'' Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps).

The [[Donatio Constantini]], by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial [[Patrimonium Petri]] in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, [[Leo IX]], cites the "Donatio" in a letter of 1054 to [[Michael Cærularius]], Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly ''imperium'', the royal priesthood. Thenceforth the "Donatio" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: [[Anselm of Lucca]] and [[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Cardinal Deusdedit]] inserted it in their collections of canons; [[Gratian]] excluded it from his ''Decretum'', but it was soon added to it as ''Palea''; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative.

In one bitter episode, [[Pope Gregory IX]] who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the ''imperium animarum'' 'command of the souls' (i.e. voicing God's will to the faithful) and the ''principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo'' 'princedom over all things and bodies in the whole world', while the Emperor wished to restore the ''imperium mundi'', imperium (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world — Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the [[battle of Cortenuova]] (1237), only embittered the opposition between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the "self-confessed heretic", the "blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse" (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy, i.e. the [[papal states]], et cetera.

== Divine and earthly imperium ==
In some monotheistic religions such as Christianity (the Catholic Church where the official language, Latin, used terms as ''Imperium Dei/Domini'') the Divine is held to have a superior imperium, as ultimate [[King of Kings]], above all earthly powers. Whenever a society accepts this Divine will to be expressed on earth, as by a religious authority, this can lead to [[theocratic]] legitimation. However, the Catholic Church and most other Christian groups acknowledge the authority of secular governments. If however a secular ruler controls the religious hierarchy, he can use it to legitimize his own authority.

Thus absolute, universal power was vested under early Islam in the original [[Caliphate]] (before it became the political toy of worldly powers 'behind the throne' and was even politically discarded by essentially secular princes), and later again claimed by [[Mahdi]]s.

The chief minister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] suggested removal of the Roman Catholic papacy's ''[[imperium in imperio]]'' (Latin for "state within a state") by requesting that Parliament pass the [[Act in Restraint of Appeals]] (1533) specifying that England was an empire and that [[The Crown]] was imperial, and a year later the [[Act of Supremacy]] proclaiming the [[Imperial Crown]] Protector and Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In Orthodox Russia too, when [[Peter I the Great]] assumed the Byzantine imperial titles ''Imperator'' and [[Autokrator]], instead of the royal Tsar, the idea in founding the [[Russian Holy Synod]] was to put an end to the old ''Imperium in imperio'' of the free Church, by substituting the synod for the all too independent [[Patriarch of Moscow]], which had become almost a rival of the Tsars — Peter meant to unite all authority in himself, over Church as well as State: through his [[Ober-Procurator]] and synod, the Emperor ruled his Church as absolutely as the military through their respective ministries; he appointed its members just as he did generals; and the Russian Government continued his policy until the end of the empire in 1917.

'''Judicial minimalism''' refers to a philosophy in [[United States constitutional law]] which promotes itself as a politically moderate viewpoint such as that of retired Judge Sandra Day O'Connor. It is often compared to other judicial philosophies such as judicial activism, judicial originalism, and judicial textualism.

==The minimalist viewpoint==
Minimalists offer very small, case-specific interpretations of Constitutional Law as an alternative to what they see as the excesses of extremists on both sides.  They believe that a stable Constitutional Law is in everybody's interest, and place great importance on the concept of precedent and ''[[stare decisis]]''.  They argue that only very small interpretations away from precedent, narrowly applied, and based on the general direction of society constitute true [[judicial restraint]] rather than any originalist or strict constructionist viewpoint (in opposition to conservatives), while still allowing for a [[Living Constitution]] (albeit one with a much slower adaptation than many liberals would like). Depending on the minimalist's particular preferences, a minimalist on the court would be likely to either very slowly bolster or chip away at [[abortion]] precedents rather than proclaim a lasting ban on or legalization of abortion via Constitutional rulings.

[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]] is often hailed by minimalists as their ideal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass (2006). ''Stanford Law Review'', Volume 58, Issue 6 - April 2006, "Problems with Minimalism."&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurring opinion in the 2011 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[NASA v. Nelson]]'', Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] derided minimalism as a "never-say-never disposition [which] does damage for several reasons".&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;[[Eugene Volokh|Volokh, Eugene]] (2011-01-19) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/19/judicial-minimalism-at-least-of-one-sort-pro-and-con/#more-41851 “Judicial Minimalism” (at Least of One Sort), Pro and Con], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Samuel Alito]], writing for the majority, defended the Court's minimalist approach in choosing to "decide the case before us and leave broader issues for another day".&lt;ref name=Volokh/&gt;

==Summary and complaints against "judicial extremism"==

Largely associated with [[Cass Sunstein|Cass R. Sunstein]], it is a viewpoint which criticizes the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] stance of [[originalism]] as being [[judicial activism]] in disguise.  Minimalists believe that a faithful application of originalist theory would result in a system of constitutional law in which modern societal standards would be ignored, in favor of the now-antiquated opinions held by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], probably including their views on [[gender equality]], [[racism]], and other things, which modern society would find objectionable. Minimalists claim that conservatives who subscribe to originalism are likely to ignore [[precedent]] where it is convenient for conservative political aims. Minimalists also criticize traditional [[American liberalism|liberal]] judicial activism as overexpansive and as ignorant of [[precedent]] when it is convenient to liberal political aims.

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methtods of interpreting (construing) the law.
The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130457/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

=== International law ===

[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Italian lawyer [[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Vitoria: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=978-0-521-36714-1|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

=== Further disciplines ===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of law-practice management==
Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011). ''Lawyer Tech Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Minick and David Tsai, [http://www.sfbar.org/articles/google_scholar.aspx Google Scholar:  A New Way to Search for Cases and Related Legal Publications]. [[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ott Mayer, [http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/04/30/focus3.html Role of legal administrators changing as duties expand, become more complex] (April 29, 2007). ''Memphis Business Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Denney, [http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v34_is3_pg35.html Evolution of the Professional Administrator] (April/May 2008). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 34, No. 3, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith and Ashby Jones, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577388180888033106 Practicing Business: Professional Managers Gain Wider Presence at Law Firms] (May 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm?

'''Legal archaeology''' is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." &lt;ref name = &gt;Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, and Harry G. Prince, ''Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials: Fifth Edition'', pp. 749-50, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided. These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." &lt;ref name = Vogel&gt;Joan Vogel, ''Cases in Context: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification, and Ploof v. Putnam'', 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 791, 792.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal archaeologist might also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information might show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or if one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case. &lt;ref name = Maute&gt;Judith Maute, ''Response: The Values of Legal Archaeology'', 2000 Utah L. Rev. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal realism'''  is a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] approach to [[law]] and is the view that [[jurisprudence]] should emulate the methods of [[natural science]], i.e., rely on [[empirical evidence]]. [[Hypotheses]] have to be tested against observations of the world. 

Legal realists believe that the legal science should investigate law exclusively with the value-free methods of natural sciences, also called 'sciences of the real' in some [[Continental Europe|Continental]] languages (e.g., 'Realwissenschaften', in [[German language|German]]). Some legal realists (e.g., [[Leon Petrażycki]] and [[Max Weber]]) also hold that there should exist, too, a legal dogmatics, which is independent of legal science proper but, this notwithstanding, can be regarded as a science in its own right (and so, despite its being a non-real, or formal, science). However, the focus of all legal realists is on legal science proper.

==Overview==
Due to their value-free approach, legal realists are opposed to [[natural law]] traditions. Legal realists regard these traditions as historical and/or social phenomena to be explained by making use of a variety of psychological and sociological hypotheses. They are also opposed to any form of [[linguistic turn]] in jurisprudence. When applied to law, they regard the linguistic turn as a sort of 'emasculation' (Enrico Pattaro) of legal phenomena. This is so because legal realists conceive legal phenomena as psychical phenomena, and, notably, as a form of ''moral motivation'' of human behavior (to be investigated with the methods of psychology and/or neurosciences). All this implies that legal realists are opposed to most versions of contemporary [[legal positivism]].

A further difference from all sorts of legal positivism is that legal realists refuse to confine their investigations to state law and/or positive law. Moreover, legal realists have a conception of law that stretches far beyond legal pluralism—so popular in many versions of classical and contemporary [[sociology of law]]. This is one of the reasons why legal realism cannot be regarded as a sort of sociology of law (other reasons being: legal realists' psychologism and their refusal of the linguistic turn—a turn that affected, too, sociology of law). Apart from Max Weber (who, owing to a variety of reasons, is mostly conceptualized as sociologist rather than as a legal realist), there are two strands of legal realism in this sense: Scandinavian legal realism, founded by [[Axel Hägerström]] (1868&amp;ndash;1939), and Polish-Russian legal realism, founded by [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867&amp;ndash;1931). Both realisms, owing to their similarities (and despite their founders' ignoring one another), are sometimes referred to as 'continental legal realism' (in the singular).

In English-speaking countries the phrase 'legal realism' has often a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is used to refer to a conception of adjudication rather than of law in general. However, some legal realists in this other sense, including the founder of this movement, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], reduced law to the activity of courts and other state officials, thus proposing a kind of naturalistic and value-free reduction of law (a conception, though, that all Continental legal realists would reject, ''[[inter alia]]'', as excessively narrow). It is to this other kind of legal realism—also called 'American legal realism'—that this entry is devoted.

American legal realists (henceforth: realists) believe that there is more to adjudication than the mechanical application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding as [[legal formalism]] believes. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and [[law]] identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not all of the time. Realists believe that the legal principles that [[legal formalism]] treat as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.

Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s misunderstanding of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A. (1961). The Concept of Law (2nd ed. / with a postscript edited by Penelope A. Bulloch and Joseph Raz.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. Ch.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in conceptual analysis of concepts such as the concept of 'law'. This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. Nowadays, legal theorists tend to recognise that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.

Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the [[legal formalism]] of the late 19th century and early 20th century, and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said so that it is often said that 'we are all realists now.' However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.

A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually ''do'' in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Shiner, "Legal Realism," in Robert Audi, ed., ''The Cambridge Dictionary of'' ''Philosophy''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, "American Legal Realism," in Martin P. Golding and William A. Edmundson, eds., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory''. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; American legal realism has aptly been described as "the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 50. There was also a Scandinavian school of legal realism that arose about the same time as its American cousin. This entry focuses on American legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most legal scholars today would agree that some aspects of legal realism were misguided or over-stated, its enduring influence on legal thought and legal education has been profound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Forerunners==
Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]]. Philosophers such as [[John Dewey]] had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general "revolt against formalism," a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Neil Duxbury, ''Patterns of American Jurisprudence''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

===[[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]===
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous [[prediction theory of law]], his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his "realist" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not simply deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, and other personal and conventional values.

All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, "The Path of the Law." There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision making and states a pragmatic definition of "law": "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr."&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "The Path of the Law," 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of "text writers" who tell you that law "is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt;

Holmes next introduces his most important and influential argument, the "bad-man" theory of law: "[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, "legal duty" signifies only "a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt; The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of [[pragmatism]], Holmes suggests that this is useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.

The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of "The Path of the Law" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: "I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;William W. Fisher III, Morton J. Horwitz, Thomas A. Reed, eds., ''American Legal Realism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Morton J. Horwitz, ''The Transformation of American'' ''Law, 1870–1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it.

==Key themes==
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Jerome Frank]], [[Herman Oliphant]], [[Underhill Moore]], Walter Wheeler Cook, [[Leon Green]], and [[Felix Cohen]]. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

* ''A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law''. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically.  Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably "indeterminate."
* ''A belief in the instrumental nature of the law''. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges unavoidably take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;According to legal scholar Brian Leiter, the "core claim" of legal realism is that judges do not decide cases on purely legal grounds; other factors play a significant and in fact predominant role. Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law''. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science, as it ought to be, if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Christie, ''Jurisprudence: Text and Readings on the Philosophy of Law''. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Co., 1973, pp. 642–644.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that legal talk of "duty," "right," etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into "realistic" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.

==Criticisms==

Legal realism had its heyday from the 1920s to the 1940s. In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of "reasoned elaboration" and claimed that appeals to "legislative purpose" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book ''The'' ''Concept of Law'', British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a "decisive blow"&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 61. Leiter argues that Hart's criticism was off the mark, and that it was ''wrongly'' assumed to have refuted legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, "How will I decide this case?" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to ''guide'' their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.

Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is "riddled" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Frederick Schauer, "Easy Cases," ''Southern California Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1985), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that most legal questions have simple, clear-cut answers that no lawyer or judge would dispute is difficult to square with the realists' strong claims of pervasive legal "indeterminacy." Other critics, such as [[Ronald Dworkin]] and [[Lon Fuller]], have faulted legal realists for their attempt sharply to separate law and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Taking Rights'' ''Seriously''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978, pp. 22-28; Lon L. Fuller, ''The Morality of Law'', rev. ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, pp. 33-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and continuing relevance==
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute "formalist" or "mechanical" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted today that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about [[judicial activism]] and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to "make law," as opposed to merely "following" or "applying" existing law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lief H. Carter and Thomas F. Burke, ''Reason in Law'', 8th ed. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2015 (contending that law is frequently indeterminate and that judges often do, and should, make law by employing a variety of legal methods and sources, especially "purposive" interpretation); and Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. Garner, ''Reading'' ''Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts''. Minneapolis: West, 2012 (arguing that law is not highly indeterminate and that there is little legitimate leeway for judicial policymaking).&lt;/ref&gt; But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 60 (noting that "[t]he paradigm of scholarship established by the Realists--contrasting what courts say they're doing with what they ''actually'' do--is one that has become so much the norm that distinguished scholars practice it without even feeling the need, any longer, to self-identify as Realists").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights==
A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%.&lt;ref name="ecthr2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N. Aletras |author2=D. Tsarapatsanis |author3=D. Preotiuc-Pietro |author4=V. Lampos | title=Predicting judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights: a Natural Language Processing perspective | journal=PeerJ Computer Science | year=2016 | url=https://peerj.com/articles/cs-93/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: "In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases."

[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]].

The '''liberal democratic basic order''' ({{lang-de|freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung}} (FDGO)) is a fundamental term in German constitutional law. It determines the unalienable, invariable core structure of the German commonwealth. As such, it is the core substance of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]].

The FDGO touches on the political order and the societal and political values on which German democracy rests. According to the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|German constitutional court]], the free democratic order is defined thus:

:The free&lt;ref&gt;The German original says "freiheitlich", not "frei". See also [[liberalism]] and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freiheitlich&lt;/ref&gt; democratic basic order can be defined as an order which excludes any form of [[tyranny]] or [[arbitrariness]] and represents a governmental system under a rule of law, based upon self-determination of the people as expressed by the will of the existing majority and upon freedom and equality. The fundamental principles of this order include at least: respect for the [[human rights]] given concrete form in the Basic Law, in particular for the right of a person to life and free development; popular sovereignty; [[separation of powers]]; responsibility of government; lawfulness of administration; independence of the judiciary; the multi-party principle; and equality of opportunities for all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Kommers (1980), p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the liberal democratic basic order has been and is being rejected by parts of the left spectrum, the [[Antifaschistische Aktion|Antifa]] as well as [[Right extremism|people on the extreme right]].

Parties as well as groups can be banned if they strive to abolish the FDGO, which has been done so successfully in regard to the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (1956) and the [[Socialist Reich Party]] (1952). In 2003 as well as in 2017, attempts to ban the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD) failed. The willingness of a democracy to ban parties that endanger democracy itself has been termed "militant democracy", or "wehrhafte Demokratie" in German.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4747">'''OHADA''' is a system of [[corporate law]] and implementing institutions adopted by seventeen [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]n nations in 1993 in [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]]. OHADA is the acronym for the French "''Organisation pour l'harmonisation en Afrique du droit des affaires''", which translates into English as "Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa".

The OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states. Initially fourteen African countries signed the treaty, with two countries ([[Comoros]] and [[Guinea]]) subsequently adhering to the treaty and a third (the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) due to adhere shortly.{{When|date=November 2017}} The Treaty is open to all states, whether or not they are members of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/ Organization of African Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;  OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Characteristics==
As a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa - a region which has challenged and puzzled [[economic development|development economists]] for several decades. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former [[French colonies]], they draw chiefly on a modernised French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related. The OHADA treaty has created a supranational court ([[Common Court of Justice and Arbitration of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of Business Law]] [http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/court-of-justice-and-arbitration/ccja-at-a-glance]) to ensure uniformity and consistent legal interpretations across the member countries, and the French influence in court proceedings is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3073&amp;context=expresso Dickerson, Claire M.: "Harmonizing Business Laws in Africa: OHADA Calls the Tune"] 44:1 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (2005), 63 pages, retrieved 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical tool for legal integration is the Uniform Act. A uniform act is the recollection of all relevant legal norms needed to ease business in the Member States. As of today,{{when|date=May 2016}} OHADA includes nine validated Uniform Acts: General Commercial Law, Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups, Secured Transactions Law, Debt Resolution Law, Insolvency Law, Arbitration Law, Harmonization of Corporate Accounting, Contracts for the Carriage of Goods, Cooperatives Companies Law. Two Uniform Acts (Arbitration and Accounting) are currently being revised.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Ouster clauses seek to exclude courts from reviewing actions and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive branch of government]].]]
{{Administrative law}}

An '''ouster clause''' or '''privative clause''' is, in countries with [[common law]] legal systems, a clause or provision included in a piece of [[legislation]] by a [[legislature|legislative body]] to exclude [[judicial review]] of acts and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive]] by stripping the courts of their supervisory judicial function. According to the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], one of the important functions of the [[judiciary]] is to keep the executive in check by ensuring that its acts comply with the law, including, where applicable, the [[constitution]]. Ouster clauses prevent courts from carrying out this function, but may be justified on the ground that they preserve the powers of the executive and promote the finality of its acts and decisions.

Ouster clauses may be divided into two species&amp;nbsp;– total ouster clauses and partial ouster clauses. In the United Kingdom, the effectiveness of total ouster clauses is fairly limited. In the case of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee]]'' (1968), the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that ouster clauses cannot prevent the courts from examining an executive decision that, due to an error of law, is a nullity. Subsequent cases held that ''Anisminic'' had abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Thus, although prior to ''Anisminic'' an ouster clause was effective in preventing judicial review where only a non-jurisdictional error of law was involved, following that case ouster clauses do not prevent courts from dealing with both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, except in a number of limited situations.

The [[High Court of Australia]] has held that the [[Constitution of Australia]] restricts the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review using privative clauses. Similarly, in India ouster clauses are almost always ineffective because judicial review is regarded as part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] that cannot be excluded. The position in Singapore is unclear. Two cases decided after ''Anisminic'' have maintained the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, and it is not yet known whether the courts will eventually adopt the legal position in the United Kingdom. The [[Chief Justice of Singapore]], [[Chan Sek Keong]], suggested in a 2010 lecture that ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], which vests judicial power in the courts, and may thus be void. However, he emphasized that he was not expressing a concluded view on the matter.

In contrast with total ouster clauses, courts in the United Kingdom have affirmed the validity of partial ouster clauses that specify a time period after which aggrieved persons can no longer apply to court for a remedy.

==Background==
[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Traffic signals along [[Stamford Road]], Singapore. The effectiveness of an ouster clause may depend on whether a particular jurisdiction adopts the red-light or green-light theory of [[administrative law]].]]

According to the [[A. V. Dicey|Diceyan]] model of [[separation of powers]], the executive of a state governs according to a framework of general rules in society established by the legislature, and the judiciary ensures that the executive acts within the confines of these rules through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Introduction, Theory and History|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=1–16 at 5|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under both [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]], the courts possess supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power. When carrying out [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative action]], the court scrutinizes the legality and not the substantive merits of an act or decision made by a public authority under the three broad headings of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service|link=Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=6|parallelcite=[1985] A.C. 374 at 410|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In jurisdictions which have a written constitution, the courts also [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|assess the constitutionality of legislation]], executive actions and governmental policy. Therefore, part of the role of the judiciary is to ensure that public authorities act lawfully and to serve as a check and balance on the government's power. However, the legislature may attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the inclusion of ouster clauses in the statutes empowering public authorities to act and make decisions. These ouster clauses may be total or partial.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review: Ouster and Time Limit Clauses, the Prerogative Power, Public Interest Immunity|url=http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/extracts/9780199217762_leyland.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVZ0nNUg|archivedate=10 May 2013|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=392–437 at 392|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some examples of ouster clauses:
*'''Singapore'''. Section 47 of the Industrial Relations Act:&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Industrial Relations Act|cap=136|ed=2004}} (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; "(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an award shall be final and conclusive. (2) No award or decision or order of a Court or the President or a referee shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any court and shall not be subject to any Quashing Order, Prohibiting Order, Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account."
*'''United Kingdom'''. Section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act:&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Compensation Act 1950 ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14/12/contents 1950 c. 12], UK). Section 4(4) has since been [[repeal]]ed.&lt;/ref&gt; "The determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called into question in any court of law."

If an ouster clause achieves its desired effect in preventing the courts from exercising judicial review, it will serve as a clear signal to the decision-maker that it may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"/&gt; However, ouster clauses have traditionally been viewed with suspicion by the courts.&lt;ref name="Gilmore"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 19th-century ''[[laissez-faire]]'' theory championed by [[A. V. Dicey]], which [[Carol Harlow]] and Richard Rawlings termed as the "red-light approach" in their 1984 book ''Law and Administration'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Harlow|author2=Richard Rawlings|title=Law and Administration|location=London|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0-297-78239-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there should be a deep-rooted suspicion of governmental power and a desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"/&gt; Therefore, the executive, which is envisaged as capable of arbitrary encroachment on the rights of individual citizens, is subjected to political control by Parliament and to legal control by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow &amp; Rawlings, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum, there is the green-light approach derived from the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Introduction, Theory and History", p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and finality in the implementation of policy considerations by encouraging specialist bodies to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", p.&amp;nbsp;393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Total ouster clauses==
===In the United Kingdom===
Total ouster clauses, also known as finality clauses, seek to completely exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. In the United Kingdom, before the seminal decision of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission]]'' (1968),&lt;ref name="Anisminic"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee|link=Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|court=UKHL|year=1968|num=6|parallelcite=[1969] 2 A.C. 147|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the law drew a distinction between situations where the public body was acting within the powers conferred on it by law but committed an error of law (a "non-jurisdictional error of law"), and situations where the commission of the error of law meant that the public body did not in fact have power to act (a "jurisdictional error of law"). In the former situation, a total ouster clause precluded the courts from exercising their supervisory function and issuing any [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]] to quash the erroneous action. The courts could only step in if the error of law affected the jurisdiction of the public body to act, for example, if the public body erroneously interpreted the scope of the powers conferred upon it, and thus made a decision which it had no power to make.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"/&gt;

In ''R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore'' (1957),&lt;ref name="Gilmore"/&gt; the legality of the total ouster clause in section 36(3) of the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]] (9 &amp; 10 Geo. VI, c. 62, UK).&lt;/ref&gt; was doubted by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], which issued a ''[[certiorari]]'' against the Medical Appeal Tribunal for an error of law on the face of the record. [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Alfred Denning]] stated that the words "any decision of a claim or question ... shall be final" only excluded an appeal but not judicial review:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Gilmore'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I find it very well settled that the remedy by ''certiorari'' is never to be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words. The word "final" is not enough. That only means "without appeal." It does not mean "without recourse to ''certiorari''." It makes the decision final on the facts, but not final on the law. Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made "final," ''certiorari'' can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record.}}

In ''Anisminic'', the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] effectively held that any error of law made by a public body will render its decision a nullity, and an ouster clause does not oust the courts' jurisdiction in judicial review unless it clearly states so.&lt;ref&gt;''Anisminic'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of tribunals in the United Kingdom#Foreign Compensation Commission|Foreign Compensation Commission]] had misinterpreted certain [[delegated legislation|subsidiary legislation]], with the effect that almost all claims for foreign compensation would be defeated. Their Lordships held that this misconstruction of the legislation rendered the decision ''[[ultra vires]]'', and since the Parliament could not have intended for the ouster clause to protect an ''ultra vires'' determination, judicial review was not precluded. Though ''Anisminic'' did not expressly abolish the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, in ''R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page'' (1992)&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page|court=UKHL|year=1992|num=12|parallelcite=[1993] A.C. 682|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords noted that:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[T]he decision in [''Anisminic''] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ''ultra vires''. Thenceforward it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires.}}

Thus, in [[English law]] all errors of law are now to be considered as jurisdictional and ''ultra vires'' in a broad sense of the term. This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any error of law. The ''Anisminic'' principle was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in ''R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal'' (2011)&lt;ref name=Cart&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal|court=UKSC|year=2011|num=28|parallelcite=[2012] 1 A.C. 663|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the [[rule of law]] is promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an error of law whether it is a jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 142, para. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====
Though the scope of judicial review has been expanded considerably following ''Anisminic'', there are still a number of exceptions where total ouster clauses preclude courts from exercising their supervisory function in a judicial review.

=====Courts of law=====
The ''Anisminic'' principle applies only to public bodies exercising executive functions, over which the courts can exercise their supervisory role and have the power to decide [[question of law|questions of law]]. However, superior courts do not have any supervisory function in relation to inferior courts of law, because Parliament is deemed to have intended that such courts are to be final arbiters of questions of law. Whether the decision of a court of law is final and not subject to judicial review depends on a construction of the statute defining the jurisdiction and powers of the court. In ''Re Racal Communications Ltd.'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Re Racal Communications Ltd.|court=UKHL|year=1980|num=5|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 374|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] noted that if a statute provides that the court's decision should be final and conclusive, the "subtle distinctions formerly drawn between errors of law which go to jurisdiction and errors of law which do not" survive. Hence, any non-jurisdictional errors of law made by a court can be only corrected by appeal if the statute provides for it.&lt;ref&gt;''Racal'', pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Internal regulations=====
It was held in ''ex parte Page''&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt; that if a decision-maker is applying some "domestic law" or internal regulations instead of a general law of the land, then an ouster clause is effective in excluding judicial review unless the decision-maker acts outside his or her jurisdiction (that is, he or she has no power to enter into the adjudication of the dispute), abuses power, or acts in breach of [[natural justice]]. In the case, the House of Lords held that a university [[visitor]] (overseer) appointed by the founder of a charitable institution to regulate its internal affairs has exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes arising under the domestic law of the university that has been laid down by the founder in the constitutive documents establishing the university.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Comprehensive tribunal system to correct errors of law=====
[[File:Field House, London, UK - 20130627-06.JPG|thumb|Field House at 15 Bream's Buildings, London, where the [[Upper Tribunal]] is based. In a 2011 judgment, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] held that not all decisions of the Upper Tribunal are subject to judicial review.]]

Another exception can be found in the ''Cart''&lt;ref name=Cart/&gt; judgment. [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]] emphasized that "the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 145, para. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; On the facts of the case, he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review. By enacting the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/contents 2007 c. 15], UK).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the [[Upper Tribunal]] to hear appeals from lower tribunals, thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications. As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law, this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review. Thus, judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would "raise some important point of principle or practice" or there was "some other compelling reason".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', pp. 145–148, paras. 123–133 (the quoted phrases are from p. 147, para. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other jurisdictions===
As the United Kingdom does not have a written [[constitution]] and observes the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]], the courts there could not render an ouster clause ineffective due to inconsistency with a constitutional provision, but instead excluded its application in some cases under the [[common law]] doctrine of the rule of law. However, in jurisdictions with a written constitution and hence constitutional supremacy, the courts can exclude the application of ouster clauses by pronouncing that the provision is unconstitutional and thus null and void.

====Australia====
The [[High Court of Australia]] has shown resistance to privative clauses, holding that the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review by means of such clauses is restricted by the [[Constitution of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Richard Walter Pty.

{{quote|They [privative clauses] are not interpreted as meaning to set at large the courts or other judicial bodies to whose decision they relate. Such a clause is interpreted as meaning that no decision which is in fact given by the body concerned shall be invalidated on the ground that it has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority, provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power, that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation, and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body.}}

Thus, a privative clause does not prevent the High Court from exercising judicial review if an authority has failed to exercise power in a ''bona fide'' manner, or if the action taken or decision made is irrelevant to the subject manner of the legislation or does not come within the power conferred on the authority.&lt;ref name="Fox 615"/&gt; While a statutory clause will be inconsistent with section&amp;nbsp;75(v) if it purports to prevent the Court from determining whether a Commonwealth officer has engaged "in unlawful or unauthorized conduct" or acted "on the basis that an invalid decision is valid and enforceable",&lt;ref name="Richard Walter 6"&gt;''Richard Walter Pty.

[[File:Supreme Court of India - 200705 (edited).jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of India]] held in a 1980 case that [[judicial review]] is part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]]]]

India embraces the [[basic structure doctrine]], which states that the basic structure or features of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] may not be amended. Judicial review has been regarded as a basic feature since the case of ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="Minerva"&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India|link=Minerva Mills v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1980|num=141|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1980 S.C. 1789, 1981 (1) S.C.R. 206|courtname=auto}}, affirmed by {{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=S. P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1986|num=261|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1987 S.C. 386 at 441|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}, and {{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=|link=S. R. Bommai v.

{{quote|The power of the judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and without it, there will be no Government of Laws and the rule of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. If there is one feature of our Constitution which, more than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionably a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.}}

The Parliament's "power to destroy is not a power to amend",&lt;ref&gt;''Minerva Mills'', 1981 (1) S.C.R. at p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence the power of judicial review may not be abrogated either by the ordinary process of legislation or through the procedure of constitutional amendment. Therefore, it might be argued that ouster clauses, which are intended to make decisions by public authorities and other decision-makers final and unchallengeable before the courts, should be held void and ineffective as they deprive the aggrieved party of an avenue of seeking judicial review. However, it was held in ''A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem'' (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem|court=INSC|year=1989|num=85|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1989 S.C. 1239, 1989 (2) S.C.R. 1|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that where there are two or more courts with jurisdiction over a matter, and an ouster clause merely limits the jurisdiction to one particular court, the ouster clause is valid as the aggrieved party is still left with an avenue to proceed with his or her claim:&lt;ref&gt;''A. B. C. Laminart'', 1989 (2) S.C.R. at p. 12. See also {{citation|author=Rosy Kumar|title=A Question of Jurisdiction|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230041354/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archivedate=30 December 2011|magazine=[[India Today]]|date=26 December 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]here such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of [[meeting of the minds|ad idem]] can be shown, the other Courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. ... In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another.}}

====Singapore====
{{Main|Exclusion of judicial review in Singapore law}}
[[File:Old and New Supreme Courts.jpg|thumb|The new and old [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] buildings in Singapore. The effectiveness of ouster clauses in this jurisdiction is still unclear.]]

In Singapore, the state of the law regarding the effectiveness of ouster clauses is still unclear. Whereas in the United Kingdom the courts have abolished the distinction between non-jurisdictional and jurisdictional errors of law and affirmed that in general ouster clauses are ineffective against errors of law, Singapore cases seem to adopt the traditional pre-''Anisminic'' approach. The distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law and the effectiveness of ouster clauses against non-jurisdictional errors of law is exemplified by the cases of ''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 490, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister of Manpower'' [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 866, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yee Yut Ee'', the High Court neither expressly rejected nor affirmed the abolition of the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law in ''Anisminic'' and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Hurst, ex parte Smith'' [1960] 2 Q.B. 133 at 142, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; or an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574 at 586|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the legal position prior to ''Anisminic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', p. 495, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court did refer to ''Anisminic'', it did so only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', pp. 496–497, paras. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Stansfield'', an employee of the plaintiff alleged that he had been [[unfair dismissal|dismissed from his employment without just cause]], and made representations to the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Minister of Manpower]] to be reinstated. The Minister agreed with the employee and recommended that the plaintiff provide him with monetary compensation. Even though section&amp;nbsp;14(5) of the Employment Act&lt;ref&gt;Employment Act (Cap. 91, 1996 Rev. Ed.), now {{Singapore legislation|cap=91|ed=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that any decision of the Minister is "final and conclusive, and shall not be challenged in any court of law", the plaintiff challenged the decision by applying to the High Court for judicial review by way of ''certiorari''.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', p. 873, paras. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of its judgment, the Court cited the following passage from ''South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union'' (1980):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union|court=UKPC|year=1980|num=21|format=1|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 363 at 370|courtname=auto|juris=Malaysia}}, cited in ''Stansfield'', p. 874, para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]hen words in a statute oust the power of the High Court to review decisions of an inferior tribunal by ''certiorari'', they must be construed strictly... they will not have the effect of ousting that power if the inferior tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or "if it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity": ''per'' Lord Reid at p.&amp;nbsp;171 [of ''Anisminic'']. But if the inferior tribunal has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction, and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of the rules of natural justice, then the ouster will be effective.}}

It is presently not known whether Singapore courts will eventually adopt the current legal position in the United Kingdom. [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] observed during a 2010 lecture that what the High Court said about ''Anisminic'' in ''Stansfield'' was ''[[obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'' because the actual decision was "based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong|authorlink=Chan Sek Keong|title=Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy: A Lecture to Singapore Management University Second Year Law Students|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/516/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20469-489_Chan%20CJ.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bXAGCt7|archivedate=1 December 2011|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|date=September 2010|volume=22|pages=469–489 at 476, para. 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had concluded that the ouster clause was ineffective in preventing judicial review of the Minister's decision, as the plaintiff had not been given a fair opportunity to present its case with knowledge of the opponent's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', pp. 875–877, paras. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Chan also advanced an academic argument that ouster clauses might be viewed as being contrary to Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts, because ouster clauses strip the [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] of its supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals and other public authorities. If the argument that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted holds, there is no need to distinguish between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. However, he made it clear that he was not expressing an opinion on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, p. 477, para. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Indian example, it might be argued that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be removed through the use of ouster clauses. However, the basic features doctrine was rejected by the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] in ''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#High Court judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 461 at 479, para. 47, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] found it unnecessary to rule on whether the position taken by the High Court is correct or not.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#Court of Appeal judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347 at 367–368, para. 44, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial ouster clauses==
Unlike a total ouster clause which seeks to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. However, if the issue of whether a public authority has acted in [[bad faith]] arises, the authority's act or decision is not immune to judicial review notwithstanding the lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", pp.&amp;nbsp;399–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In ''Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council|court=UKHL|year=1956|num=2|parallelcite=[1956] A.C. 736|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords concluded by a majority that it could not impugn a partial ouster clause because, according to [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Viscount Simonds]], "plain words must be given their plain meaning", regardless of an allegation of fraud on the part of the public authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of such a narrow approach were recognized in the [[dissenting opinion|dissenting judgement]] by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], in which he doubted whether an ouster clause could protect an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means from being questioned in court. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In every class of case that I can think of the courts have always held that general words are not to be read as enabling a deliberate wrongdoer to take advantage of his own dishonesty.}}

The decision in ''Anisminic'', which held that total ouster clauses do not safeguard decisions affected by errors of law from judicial review, poses a challenge to the judgment in ''Smith'', but the latter was affirmed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1976|num=6|parallelcite=[1977] Q.B. 122|courtname=C.A.|juris=England and Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that a distinction could be drawn between a total ouster clause and a partial ouster such as the one in question, which gave the applicants six weeks to challenge the decision. Lord Denning, the [[Master of the Rolls]], explained that the rationale for upholding time limit clauses is that it is in the public interest to promote certainty of the executive's actions. If the courts were to allow plaintiffs to come to them for remedies long after the time limit for doing so has expired, the acts or decisions of authorities would be held up or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Ostler'', pp. 128–130 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lord Justice of Appeal Michael Mann explained in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' (1992):&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1992] 3 All E.R. 566 at 575, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] (England and Wales), cited with approval by Lord Justice of Appeal [[Simon Brown, Baron Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood|Simon Brown]] in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1994] 1 All E.R. 694 at 698, C.A. (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of Parliament when it uses an ''Anisminic'' clause is that questions as to validity are not excluded. When paragraphs such as those considered in ''ex p. Ostler'' are used, then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interests of certainty.}}

{{Sociology}}
'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Overview==

===Antecedents===
Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato. [...] What Plato represented as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry is resuscitated in the "two cultures" quarrel of more recent times between the humanities and the sciences.|title-link=The Educated Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 245a, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 209a, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 398a, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' 817 b-d and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, T. J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical Sociological Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 |year=2002|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9238">The term '''''post-democracy''''' was coined by [[Warwick University]] [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Colin Crouch]] in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that operate by [[Democracy|democratic system]]s ([[election]]s are held, governments fall, [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small [[elite]] is taking the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch further developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] By Colin Crouch. [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''.

[[File:Colin Crouch - Festival Economia 2013.JPG|thumb|[[Colin Crouch]] introduced the term ''post-democracy'' in 2000.]]The term was used by Crouch to design an evolution within democracies during the 21st century.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; It is a [[polemic]]al term because it calls attention to recognized democracies that are losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The term may also denote a general conception of a post-democratic system that may involve other structures of [[group decision-making]] and [[governance]] than the ones found in contemporary or historical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Joanna|last2=Long|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Moore|first3=Henrietta L.|title=The State We're In: Reflecting on Democracy's Troubles|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781785332258|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zlSNCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Popescu|first1=Delia|title=Political Action in Václav Havel's Thought: The Responsibility of Resistance|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739149577|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ToGGaQ0dabgC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fonte|first1=John|title=Democracy’s Trojan Horse|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/56-4-Democracys%20Trojan%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
By Crouch's definition:&lt;ref name="LSEpd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five minutes with Colin Crouch|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/five-minutes-with-colin-crouch/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"A post-democratic society is one that continues to have and to use all the institutions of democracy, but in which they increasingly become a formal shell. The energy and innovative drive pass away from the democratic arena and into small circles of a politico-economic elite."}}

Crouch states that we are not "living in a post-democratic society, but that we were moving towards such a condition".&lt;ref name="LSEpd"/&gt;

== Causes ==
Crouch names the following reasons:
* '''No common goals:''' For people in the [[post-industrial society]] it is increasingly difficult, in particular for the [[underclass]], to identify themselves as a group and therefore difficult to focus on [[Political party|political parties]] that represent them. For instance [[laborer]]s, [[farmer]]s or [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] no longer feel attracted to one political movement and this means that there is no common goal for them as a group to get united.
* '''[[Globalization]]:''' The effect of globalization makes it almost impossible for nations to work out their own economic policy. Therefore, large [[trade agreement]]s and [[supranational union]]s (e.g., the [[European Union]]) are used to make policy but this level of politics is very hard to control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows [[Multinational_corporation|transnational corporations]] with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect domestic economies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Post-Democracy|last = Crouch|first = |publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Non-balanced debates:''' In most democratic countries the positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that [[political campaign]]s are looking more like [[advertising]] to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes "sensitive" issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist [[Peter Oborne]] presented a documentary of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], arguing that it had become [[Aristocracy (government)|anti-democratic]] because it targeted a number of [[floating voters]] with a narrow agenda.
* '''Entanglement between public and private sector:''' There are large shared interests between politics and business. Through [[lobbying]] companies, [[multinational corporations]] are able to bring about [[legislation]] more effectively than the inhabitants of a country. Corporations and governments are in close relation because states need corporations as they are great employers. But as much of the production is [[outsourcing|outsourced]], and corporations have almost no difficulty in moving to other countries, labor law becomes employee-unfriendly and tax bites are moved from companies to individuals. It becomes more common for politicians and managers to switch jobs (the 'revolving door').
* '''[[Privatization]]:''' Then there is the neoliberal idea of [[new public management]] ([[neoliberalism]]) of privatizing public services. Privatized institutions are difficult to control by democratic means and have no allegiance to human communities, unlike government. Crouch uses the term “phantom firms” to describe the flexibility and elusive nature of firms which bend to the market. He concludes that private firms have incentive to make individual profit rather than better the welfare of the public. For example, he states that there is a problem with pharmaceutical companies funding (and skewing) medical research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
As a consequence:
* Fewer voters use their right to vote, or do vote but don't expect much.
* Politicians can ignore an undesirable outcome of a [[referendum]] or [[opinion poll]]. For instance in 2005 when [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] voted ''No'' at a referendum about the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] these countries still ratified the treaty after only minor modifications were made.
* The rise of [[xenophobic]] and other [[populist]] parties who capitalise on prevailing discontent. 
* Foreign governments can influence the internal politics of a sovereign country. According to Crouch, the way the [[eurozone crisis]] was handled is the best example of how things work in a post-democracy. European leaders managed to bring about a new government taking office in [[Italy]], and in [[Greece]] far-reaching [[austerity]] measures were put in place, contrary to the vote in a popular referendum.
* Private interest becomes increasingly influential in public policy.

== Solutions ==
{{See also|Online participation|LiquidFeedback|Collective problem solving}}
According to Crouch there is an important task for [[social media]] in which voters can participate more actively in [[public debate]]s. In addition, these voters would have to join [[advocacy groups]] for specific interests. The citizens have to reclaim their place in decision making. He calls this post-post-democracy.

The [[Occupy movement]] was a form of more or less disorganized opposition that grew out of the dissatisfaction with to the power of the [[bank]]ing industry.

{{Globalize/US|date=December 2016}}
{{professional responsibility}}
{{Competition law}}
In its most general sense, the '''practice of law''' involves giving [[legal advice]] to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal [[negotiation]]s and [[court]] proceedings such as [[lawsuit]]s, and is applied to the professional services of a [[lawyer]] or attorney at law, [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or [[civil law notary]]. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  [[Agency (law)|agents]]. These professions include [[real estate]], [[banking]], [[accounting]], and [[insurance]]. Moreover, a growing number of [[legal document assistant]]s (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by [[computer]]-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the [[software]] in order to construct the [[Legal instrument|legal documents]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the practice of law is conditioned upon [[Admission to practice law|admission to practice of law]], and specifically [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] of a particular [[U.S. state|state]] or other territorial [[jurisdiction]]. The [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Law Institute]] are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf |title=State Definitions of the Practice of Law |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114222449/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized practice of law===

"Unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by [[statute]], [[regulation]], or court rules.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

====Definition====
The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" is variable, and is often conclusory and [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]],&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garner, Bryan A. ed. |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7th |place=St. Paul MN |publisher=West |pages=1191–1192 |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'', it is the doing of a lawyer's or [[counsel]]or's work by a non-lawyer for money.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines unauthorized practice of law as "The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed.  Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies.  Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. . . .&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers |publisher = American Law Institute|year=1998 |edition=4 cmt c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; Some states have defined the "practice of law" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arbitration and The Unauthorized Practice of Law |journal=[[ARIAS Quarterly U.S.]] |publisher=AIDA Reinsurance &amp; Insurance Arbitration Society |date=First Quarter 2006 |volume=13 |pages=16–19 |first1=David M. |last1=Spector |first2=Jessica |last2=Romero |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085329/http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers.&lt;ref name="BNA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uslawwatch.com/2010/08/16/finance/bna-insights-state-regulation-unauthorized-practice-law-arbitration-mediation-trend-permitting-multijurisdictional-practice-alternative-dispute-resolution/  |title=BNA INSIGHTS: State Regulation of Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arbitration and Mediation: The Trend Toward Permitting Multijurisdictional Practice in Alternative Dispute Resolution |date=August 16, 2010 |work=Securities Regulation &amp; Law Report |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfRtIxtVG48C&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;f=false |title=Arbitration: essential concepts |first1=Steven C. |last1=Bennett |pages= 175–178 |place=New York |date=May 2002 |publisher=Incisive Media, LLC |isbn= 978-0-9705970-8-3}} {{ISBN|0-9705970-8-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States bankruptcy court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|Eastern District of Tennessee]] has held that "providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice."&lt;ref name=software/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; The [[North Carolina State Bar]] has held that "definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice."&lt;ref name=software&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Software Practice Law?

Lienguard, Inc., [http://www.ncbusinesslitigationreport.com/uploads/file/2014NCBC%2011.pdf 2014 NCBC 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas]] law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.123.  Chapter 38 of the penal code, containing 38.122 and 38.123] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190606/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony).&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of "Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0454/Sections/0454.23.html §454.23 Fla. Stat.] (2016)("Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree."&lt;/ref&gt; which is punishable by up to six months in prison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html §775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.](2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and $5000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html §775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat.] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] has a law which makes it a “[[Disorderly conduct|disorderly person]]s offense” to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a “crime in the fourth degree” to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=21|section=22|citeonly=true}} In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Lindsay|title=2015 Survey of Unlicensed Practice of Law Committees|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/2015_upl_report_final.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 December 2016|date=September 2015|quote=The Florida Bar continues to lead the country in funding UPL enforcement, spending approximately $1.8 million annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called "learned professions" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a [[monopoly]], the existence of laws governing (or defining) "unauthorized practice of Law" does not, ''ipso facto'' mean that they will be enforced.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unauthorized+Practice |title=Unauthorized practice |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge [[Richard Posner]] characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers.&lt;ref name="Federalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/the-abas-attack-on-unauthorized-practice-of-law-and-consumer-choice |title=The ABA's Attack on "Unauthorized" Practice of Law and Consumer Choice |date=May 1, 2003 |first1=George W.C. |last1=McCarter |publisher=[[The Federalist Society|The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge observed that the legal profession is “a cartel of providers of services relating to society’s laws” which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. "Modern economists call it '[[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]]', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members’ incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry."&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in [[Arizona]] for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Creasy'', 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, "Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a [[Sunset provision|sunset law]] in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in ''State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.'', 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in ''Arizona Title''."&lt;ref&gt;Rose at 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">The '''''Scholia Sinaitica''''' are fragments of a work of [[Roman law]] written in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], dating between 438 and 529 AD, containing comments to the books 35-38 of [[Ulpian]]'s ''ad Sabinum'' treatise.

The papyrus fragments that show parts of the work were discovered by the Greek scholar [[Gregorios Bernardakis]] in the 19th century in a [[Mount Sinai]] convent.

The scroll is not the work of a single author, but of different authors at different times who are generally thought to be of Eastern origin. The literature suggests that the authors were connected to the [[Law School of Beirut]], they cite numerous works of Roman jurists, texts from imperial constitutions and also the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]],'' demonstrating knowledge and availability of legal texts of Roman law broader than that demonstrated by contemporary authors of the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the empire.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | publisher=American Philosophical Society | year=1953 | isbn= 9780871694324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DvinfernoPopeNicholasIII m.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dante]] speaks to [[Pope Nicholas III]], committed to the ''[[Hell|Inferno]]'' for his simony, in [[Gustave Doré]]'s [[wood engraving]], 1861. (portrait of the [[Malebolge#The Ten Bolgias|Third Bolgia]] of the Eighth Circle of Hell)]]
[[File:Abbé pratiquant la simonie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Abbot practising simony (France, 12th century)]]
'''Simony''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}} is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932, "Simon."&lt;/ref&gt; who is described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9–24 as having offered two disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] to anyone on whom he would [[Laying on of hands|place his hands]].  The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1880)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt; Simony was one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

==History==
===Catholic Church===
Although an offense against [[canon law]], Simony became widespread in the [[Catholic Church]] in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the canon law, the word bears a more extended meaning than in [[English law]]. ''Simony according to the canonists'', says [[John Ayliffe]] in his ''[[John Ayliffe#Works|Parergon]]'',
{{quote|"...is defined to be a deliberate act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual, or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is temporal."}}

[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal Marco Corner investing Marco, abbot of Carrara, with his benefice, [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' the Decretum&lt;ref&gt;Pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decretals&lt;ref&gt;Bk. v. tit. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the subject. The offender whether ''simoniacus'' (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or ''simoniace promotus'' (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a [[Secular clergy|secular priest]], or to confinement in a stricter [[monastery]] if a [[Regular clergy|regular]]. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent ''simoniace promotus'' was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Certain matters were simoniacal by the [[canon law]] but would not be regarded as such in English law.{{efn|For example, the sale of [[tithes]], the taking of a fee for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], absolution, marriage or burial, the concealment of one in [[mortal sin]] or the reconcilement of an impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for spiritualities.}} So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons (deprived of citizens' rights due to conviction) could accuse another of it. English provincial and [[legatine]] constitutions continually assailed simony.

===Church of England===
The [[Church of England]] struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of [[English law]], simony is defined by [[William Blackstone]] as "obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol I|date=1765|pages=376–7|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more narrowly, "the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical [[benefice]] for gift or reward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol IV|date=1769|page=62|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[English and Welsh law|English law]] recognized simony as an offence,&lt;ref&gt;'''3''' ''[[Edward Coke|Coke's Institutes]]'' 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]] promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the [[Simony Act 1588]].  The cases of [[Bishop of St. David's]] [[Thomas Watson (Bishop of St David's)|Thomas Watson]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;Handley, S.

By the [[Benefice]]s Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a [[benefice]], and in resignation of a [[benefice]]. The [[common law]] (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of [[the Crown]]) has been considerably modified by statute.

The '''single-subject rule''' is a rule in the [[constitutional law]] of some jurisdictions that stipulates that some or all types of [[legislation]] may deal with only one main issue. One purpose is to avoid complexity in laws, to avoid any hidden consequences that legislators or voters may miss when reading the proposed law.  Another is to prevent legislators attaching an unpopular provision ("[[rider (politics)|rider]]") to an unrelated popular one, whether in the hope of sneaking the unpopular one through, or in the hope of causing the popular one to be rejected (a type of [[wrecking amendment]]).

==Scope of a bill==
In [[English law]], the [[long title]] of a [[Bill (law)|bill]] or [[act of parliament]] states its purpose; this may enumerate multiple purposes, or end with a vague formula like "and for other purposes". A proposed amendment to a bill may be rejected if it is outside the scope defined in its long title; alternatively, the title may be amended to increase its scope.  An [[omnibus bill]] covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics.

==Australia==
[[Section 55 of the Constitution of Australia]] provides a single-subject rule for taxation legislation: "Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect". The same section also requires laws imposing taxation to "deal with one subject of taxation only" (except those relating to customs and excise).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Australia]], [http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s55.html section 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] states that "A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendment of this Constitution]] shall not contain any other proposal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article46_4|title=Constitution of Ireland|date=October 2015|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 46.5|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], which could be [[Implied repeal|implicitly amended]].&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forde|first1=Michael|last2=Leonard|first2=David|title=Constitutional Law of Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVsQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316|accessdate=3 June 2016|year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667380|pages=316, fn.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
In [[Swiss law]], the "principle of the unity of the subject matter" ({{lang-de|Grundsatz der Einheit der Materie}}, {{lang-fr|principe de l'unité de la matière}}) applies to [[federal popular initiative]]s and to parliamentary legislation that is [[Referendums by country#Switzerland|subject to a referendum]]. It has been derived by the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] from the provision in article 34, section 2 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] which guarantees "the freedom of the citizen to form an opinion and to give genuine expression to his or her will" in the exercise of political rights. The Court has outlined the principle as follows:

:"The principle of the unity of the subject matter requires that the subject of a referendum may, in principle, have only one topic area as its subject, that is, that two or several substantive questions or subject matters may not be joined into one referendum proposition in such a way that the voters face a dilemma and do not have a free choice between the several parts. If an item of legislation addresses several substantive questions or subject matters, the unity of the subject matter is only preserved if the several parts have a material intrinsic connection with each other, are materially related to each other and are aimed at the same goal; this material connection may not be merely artificial, subjective or political in nature. (...) Because the concept of the unity of the subject matter is a relative one, and because the weight given to the several parts of a legislative proposition and their relationship to each other is principally a political question, the authorities enjoy wide discretion in the shaping of referendum propositions."&lt;ref&gt; [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], judgment [http://jumpcgi.bger.ch/cgi-bin/JumpCGI?id=12.09.2006_1P.223/2006 1P.223/2006] of 12 September 2006, section 2; author's translation of the German original.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The single subject rule exists in 41 [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] in the [[United States of America]].  

For example, the [[constitution of Minnesota]], Article IV, Section 17, requires that "No law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title." Conversely, neither the [[U.S. Congress]] nor the [[U.S. Constitution]] has such a rule so riders which are completely unrelated to the main [[bill (law)|bill]] are commonplace. These [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] are often put into bills at the last minute, so that any [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] who may read the legislation before actually voting on it will not have a chance to catch it. An effort is underway, however, to add a [[single subject amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution to apply a single subject rule to the Congress.&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articlevcaucus.com/uncategorized/july-newsletter/| title=July Newsletter| publisher=Article V News| accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been charged that single-subject rules have been misused as a political or judicial measure to slow or nullify ballot initiatives.  An example of accusation of misuse of this law occurred in [[Colorado]] when a former governor made a statement against a single-subject ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_3929774 |title=Court bars immigration vote |publisher=The Denver Post |date=June 13, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616115209/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_3929774 |archivedate=June 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule can also result in overly narrow questions, that result in no substantial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16542 |title=Single Subject Rules |date=May 8, 2009 |publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]] |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law===
*In July 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled that a November 2004 [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[constitution of Georgia (U.S. state)|constitution of Georgia]] against [[same-sex marriage]] would be allowed to stand, despite also banning recognition of same-sex marriages done in other states, and banning [[civil union]]s. Additionally, voters in the [[referendum]] were told of only the same-sex marriage question, while the [[ballot]] failed to mention the other two issues, preventing voters from giving fully [[informed consent]]. A judge had previously ruled that voters had the right to decide the issue of civil unions separately, thus putting the two issues as one violated Georgia's single-subject rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16289">'''Unbundled legal services''', also known as '''limited scope representation''' and '''discrete task representation''', is a method of [[legal representation]] in the [[United States]] in which an [[lawyer|attorney]] and client agree to limit the scope of the attorney’s involvement in a [[lawsuit]] or other legal action, leaving responsibility for those other aspects of the case to the client in order to save the client money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/civil/definitions.shtml#u New York City Civil Court: Definitions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directlaw.com/UnBundlinglegalservices.asp What are "Unbundled" Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zorza.net/resources/Ethics/mosten-borden.htm Unbundled Legal Services - mosten and borden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

Unbundled legal services are employed as an attempt to lower costs for the client by reducing the amount of time an attorney spends – and therefore the amount the attorney bills –  on a legal matter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqEfql2bKcM YouTube video]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[American Bar Association]] study estimates that "fewer than three in ten of the legal problems of low-income households are brought to the justice system and only four in ten for moderate income households."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reese, American Bar Ass’n, (1994).|first=Roy W.|author2=Carolyn A. Eldred |title=Legal Needs Among Low-Income and Moderate-Income Households: Summary of Findings from the Comprehensive Legal Needs Study 22|journal=American Bar Association|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[New York State Bar Association]], "[u]nbundling is seen as a way to increase legal access for middle income consumers..." "Clients find [[unbundling]] attractive because it saves money and gives them more control over the process and strategy decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York State|first=Bar Association|title=Report and Recommendations on "Unbundled" Legal Services|url=http://www.nysba.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Substantive_Reports&amp;ContentID=2736&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm|work=Commission on Providing Access to Legal Services for Middle Income Consumers|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbundled attorneys are more likely to offer flat fee pricing to complete tasks, as opposed to the more common practice of hourly billing by full-service attorneys. Depending on the [[jurisdiction]], they may provide [[legal ghostwriting]] services, that is, drafting legal documents on behalf of the client without formally appearing before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solopracticeuniversity.com/2010/02/08/the-future-middle-class-of-the-legal-profession-unbundled-legal-services-2/ The Future 'Middle Class' of the Legal Profession – Unbundled Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
They may offer legal coaching to clients who plan to represent themselves [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|''pro se'']] in the courtroom. Or they might do the opposite, agreeing that clients handle their lawsuits up until the trial phase, at which point the attorney takes over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.martindale.com/an-a-ha-moment-the-emergence-of-unbundled-legal-services An A-Ha Moment: The Emergence of Unbundled Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution ==

The phrase “unbundled legal services” has been attributed to [[UCLA]] law professor [[Forrest S. Mosten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/all-faculty-profiles/adjunctslecturers/Pages/forrest-s-mosten.aspx Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, “Woody” Mosten wrote “Unbundling Legal Services: A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte,” which was published by the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostenmediation.com/books/unbundlinglegal.html Unbundling Legal Services | A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte | Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosten, a California attorney, specializes in family law and divorce mediation. Throughout his career he has emphasized the importance of access to justice, which likely contributed to his involvement in promoting unbundled legal services. Mosten has received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Innovations in Legal Access from the ABA Section of Delivery of Legal Services, and the Lawyer as Problem Solver Award from the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostenmediation.com/bio.html Mediation Expert | High Conflict Mediations | Beverly Hills Mediator | Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2017, Mosten's "Unbundled Legal Services: A Family Lawyer's Guide" (co-written with Elizabeth Potter Scully), reflecting years of changes and development in the unbundling field, was also published by the American Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/store/productdetails.aspx?productid=277398039|title=Unbundled Legal Services: A Family Lawyer's Guide|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also recently a guest on the [https://www.unbundledattorney.com/podcast/episodes/93998 Unbundled Attorney Mastermind Podcast] discussing the history and future of unbundled legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unbundledattorney.com/podcast/episodes/93998|title=Episode: A Discussion with Forrest “Woody” Mosten, the Founder of Unbundled Legal Services: Exploring the History and Exciting Future of Unbundling|work=Unbundled Attorney|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Divorce in the United States|Divorce]] is an area of law that can lend itself to unbundling particularly well, and the development of unbundled legal services has grown largely out of the family law field. Another California family law attorney, M. Sue Talia, helped popularize unbundled legal services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pli.edu/Content.aspx?dsNav=Rpp:1,N:4294933685-168&amp;ID=PE674962 Faculty Profile - M. Sue Talia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Building upon Mosten’s work, Talia wrote several publications designed to help clients get the most out of unbundling.

Largely because of the advocacy by Mosten and Talia, among others, for the adoption of unbundled legal services by mainstream lawyers, which also emphasized new ethical guidelines for unbundling while maintaining the established rules, the California State Bar formally recognized unbundled legal services as a legitimate and important practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=California|first=State Bar of|title=Limited Scope Legal Assistance (Unbundling) Resolution|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1264452611.64/Limited%20Scope%20Legal%20Assistance%20Resolution.pdf|work=Board of Governors of the State Bar of California May 15, 2009 Meeting|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states soon followed [[California]]’s lead in officially permitting unbundled legal services. With its growing acceptance in the legal profession, unbundled legal services began to evolve into other areas of law. Unbundled attorneys also began combining this new representation technique with emerging technologies such as teleconferencing and cloud computing. One of the early adopters of [[e-lawyering]] has been North Carolina lawyer Stephanie Kimbro, who implemented a “[[virtual law firm|virtual law office]]” in 2006 when she focused her practice on estate planning and business law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Solo Practice|title=Syllabus|url=http://solopracticeuniversity.com/faculty/kimbro/|work=Virtual Law Office Online Course|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimbro has since expanded her practice but continues to deliver her services solely by virtual office. She received an ABA Award for Excellence in eLawyering in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Bar|first=Association|title=The Business of Practicing Law|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v37_is1_pg28.html|work=So You Want to Start a Virtual Practice?|publisher=ABA|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last areas of unbundled legal services to be embraced by state bar associations has been legal ghostwriting. Legal ghostwriting usually entails an attorney drafting a legal document –  such as a summons and complaint, an answer or an appellate brief – on behalf of a client. The client maintains responsibility for the other aspects of the lawsuit, such as filing, corresponding with the court and opposing counsel and generally prosecuting their case. Under this agreement, the attorney [[ghostwriter]] is not the attorney of record. Instead, the client appears in the action ''pro se'', meaning they represent themselves. The unbundled attorney might in this case inform the court of their assistance drafting the document.

In 2007 the ABA relaxed its professional ethical rules to expressly permit unbundled legal services and legal ghostwriting in Rule 1.2(c).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, the New York County Law Association echoed the ABA opinion by formally giving its blessing to the practice of legal ghostwriting as consistent with the state bar’s ethical rules.  The NYCLA Ethics Committee on Professional Ethics in its Opinion 742 stated that “…it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a ''[[pro se]]'' litigant without disclosing the lawyer’s participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‘where necessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Professional Ethics|first=NYCLA Committee on|title=Opinion 742|url=http://www.nycla.org/siteFiles/Publications/Publications1348_0.pdf|work=NYCLA Publications|publisher=New York City Lawyers' Association|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain jurisdictions have called for the implementation of clinics in law schools to teach unbundling legal services to students in a practical setting, and to encourage future lawyers to use the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klempner|first=Rochelle|title=Unbundled Legal Services in Litigated Matters in New York State|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ip/partnersinjustice/Unbundled.pdf|work=A Proposal To Test the Efficacy through Law School Clinics|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Opponents of unbundled legal services often cite ethical concerns about the [[professional responsibility]] of a lawyer for his or her client. For one, an attorney owes the court a "[[duty of candor]]" in his or her dealings with the court. By working on a lawsuit on behalf of a client but failing to appear, some courts have held this duty is violated.&lt;ref&gt;Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268, 1271-73 (10th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, full-service attorneys handle all aspects of a case and can be [[liable]] for [[legal malpractice]] should they be [[negligent]] in their representation of clients. Critics claim that, should an attorney limit the scope of his or her representation of a client, they might escape a malpractice claim despite having committed malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis v. Maine, 448 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear that a lack of communication between lawyer and client can lead to confusion about who is responsible for what, and that important issues of a client's case can fall through the cracks.

State bar associations and courts have split on the ethics of unbundling when it comes to legal ghostwriting. Some jurisdictions have ruled that ghostwriting by attorneys is prohibited, claiming that failing to disclose their assistance to a self-represented client would be misleading to the court and their adversary in the lawsuits. Others oppose legal ghostwriting because they believe it would allow an attorney to evade responsibility for a [[frivolous lawsuit]] filed by their client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ethics and Professional Responsibility|first=Standing Committee on|title=Formal Opinion 07-446|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|work=Undisclosed Legal Assistance to Pro Se Litigant|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=15 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain critics have argued that legal ghostwriting actually gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage over his or her adversary, even when that adversary has an attorney. The reason for this is that judges have had a history of giving pro se litigants more leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. For example, a person appearing pro se might be allowed to fix a procedural error but had a lawyer had made the same mistake, their error would have led to some adverse consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (“It is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.”)&lt;/ref&gt; When a self-represented litigant uses an attorney as a ghostwriter, critics argue he or she should not be entitled to any special treatment. However, proponents of legal ghostwriting point out that while judges might grant certain flexibility to ''pro se'' clients on procedural matters, no judge would rule in favor of a party simply because they lacked an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=2002|pages=1145, 1157–1158|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid the potential for this unfair advantage, some jurisdictions, like New York, require an attorney to disclose in papers submitted to the court that they were prepared by an attorney, but attorneys are not required to disclose their name or firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unified Court System|first=New York State|title=Rule 1.2(c)|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/ForAttorneys/ProfessionalStandardsforAttorneys/NYRulesofProfessionalConduct4109.pdf|work=Rules of Professional Conduct|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions look at the intent of the attorney for his legal ghostwriting. Where an attorney used the ghostwriting technique to avoid disclosing that he was not admitted in the state where the case was filed, it may be ruled [[legal ethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner v. Reiter, 2010 WL 3987434 (N.D. Cal.)&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] have been amended to allow for legal ghostwriting where the attorney merely intends to offer unbundled legal services to a client.

Another ethical concern concerning unbundled legal services is that it leads to the [[commoditization]] of law. Rather than treating the law as a profession, critics believe unbundling might lead to a factory-like approach, where cases are treated with a "one-size-fits-all" approach.

However, [[Richard Susskind]] in his 2008 book "The End of Lawyers: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services," argues that, as technology progresses, lawyers might have no choice but to move toward commoditization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susskind.com/endoflawyers.html Richard Susskind&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of do-it-yourself companies that sell blank legal documents like [[LegalZoom]], lawyers must compete with new low-cost options. Further driving down attorney fees has been [[outsourcing]], where attorneys educated in American law but not necessarily licensed in any state provide services to law firms at reduced rates.

'''Western law''' refers to the [[Law|legal traditions]] of [[Western culture]].  Western culture has an idea of the importance of [[law]] which has its roots in both [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].  As Western culture has a [[Graeco-Roman]] [[Classics|Classical]] and [[Renaissance]] cultural influence, so does its legal systems.

==History==
The rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in the early 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. Eventually, it was only in the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, that [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence can be traced to this day in all Western legal systems (although in different manners and to different extents in the [[common law|common]] (Anglo-American) and the [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] (continental European) legal traditions).  

The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship.   The ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[equality of women]],  [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]], and were principles which formed the basis of modern [[Western culture]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Western legal culture==
Western [[legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers to name a few. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law' The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;   

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyse non western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level. Basically the latter group represents primacy of prejudices, myths and taboo as viable means to conduct human society.
