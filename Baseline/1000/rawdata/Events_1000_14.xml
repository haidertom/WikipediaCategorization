'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.&lt;ref&gt;http://studerende.au.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/nyhedsarkiv/nyhed/artikel/danske-topledere-ruster-au-studerende-til-barsk-virkelighed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaders' Forum ===
[[File:ASForum.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders’ Forum session with Connie Hedegaard at Aarhus Symposium 2015.]]
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/challenge-faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97871/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/digital/jimmy-maymann-det-nytter-ikke-at-ville-holde-fremskridtet-tilbage&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Andrea Michaels was born in the [[Arbe concentration camp]] (today [[Rab]], [[Croatia]], on the northern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]]) to Lelja Kauders (b. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, August 25, 1923 – d.

Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels and her mother, along with her mother's [[Jewish]] parents, Paul (Palvo) Kauders and Elza Ackerman Kauders, escaped in a small boat across the Adriatic to Italy.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; Michaels lived in Italy to the age of four with her grandparents until her mother, who had married an American pilot, sent for her to come live in America.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage ended, and after Michaels arrived in America, her mother married Peter Gerson, who adopted Andrea and moved the family from [[Silverlake, California]], to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; When Michaels was ten, the family moved to [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt;

An only child Michaels graduated from [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classmates.com/places/school/school/3516/m?startYear=1900&amp;endYear=9999&amp;communityId=3516&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1961 and 1962, transferring to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA) before marrying Bob Spritz on February 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage lasted ten years, and they had a son, Jon (b.

== Early career ==
Instead of pursuing a career in Psychology, Michaels began working with the Ron Rubin Orchestras in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Maggie, "Spectacular Events Keep Encino Firm in Demand," Features Section, Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she became interested in the [[event planning]] business when there was no formalized industry. She produced her first event in 1978—-a [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] celebration for Marsh McClellan Insurance Company. By 1982, the company had been restructured and renamed Michaels, Rubin and Associates.&lt;ref name=ben7879 /&gt; Michaels and Rubin dissolved their relationship in December 1988, and on that same day, Extraordinary Events was launched.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee With Andrea Michaels - Meetings And Conventions".

In November 2008, white powder was mailed to temples of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) in [[Los Angeles California Temple|Los Angeles]] and [[Salt Lake Temple|Salt Lake City]], causing both to be closed temporarily while the mailings were investigated. There was speculation the mailings were in protest of the support by the Church for [[Proposition 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27707413/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/white-powder-sent-mormon-temples/|title=White powder sent to Mormon temples|work=Associated Press|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Burgess returned to the subject matter with ''The Bloodline of Christ'' that was shown in September 2013 on the [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] channel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''April 26''': [[Wu Sangui]], a powerful Ming general, moves his army through [[Shanhai Pass]] (at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]]) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=277–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''May 18''': After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}, note 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;

At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)
*'''June 25''': because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420–422. {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as June 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chronology of the universe''' describes the history and [[future of the universe]] according to [[Big Bang]] cosmology. The earliest stages of the universe's existence are estimated as taking place 13.8 [[billion years]] ago, with an [[confidence level|uncertainty]] of around 21 million years at the 68% confidence level.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;
The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck Collaboration]] in 2015 published the estimate of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago (68% confidence interval). See Table 4 on page 31 of pdf. {{Cite journal

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future.

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]].

Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===
:''Around 150 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang''
{{See also|Stellar formation|Dwarf galaxy| Baryon acoustic oscillations|Observable universe#Large-scale structure|Structure formation|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Stelliferous era}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]s often showcase galaxies from an ancient era that tell us what the early Stelliferous Age was like]]
[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.
|}

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

[[Image:Displace me X.jpg|thumb|Promotional poster]]

'''Displace Me''' was a nationwide event hosted by the nonprofit [[Invisible Children Inc]]. on April 28, 2007. In 15 cities across the [[United States]], 68,000 individuals came together to raise awareness about the situation of the [[Displaced persons camp|displacement camps]] in northern [[Uganda]].

The event had three main goals:
#To educate participants about displacement camps in the North by simulating, as best as possible, the experience of living in an IDP camp.
#To create greater national and international attention of the humanitarian crises in northern Uganda.
#To garner the political attention needed to see a peaceful resolution to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]], primarily through the appointment of one senior level U.S. diplomat.

==The event==
Displace Me was created to be an experiential event. To encourage the simulation, participants were asked to bring the following:
*Enough cardboard to build something the size of a small tent.
*A sleeping bag.
*A 1.5-liter bottle of water (with an airtight seal—to be collected upon entry).
*A box of saltine crackers (with sealed packaging—to be collected upon entry).
*A current photo of you wearing a white T-shirt with a red X.

With 15 locations across the United States, participants had to travel long distances to reach their “camps.” The traveling aspect was reflective of the displaced individuals in northern Uganda who were given 48 hours to leave their homes and relocate to displaced camps throughout the region. Once Displace Me participants arrived at their camps, they built “huts” out of cardboard boxes. Throughout the remainder of the night, participants were rationed food and water and heard, via video, personal testimonies from those living in the IDP camps in the North.

Other aspects of the event included a speech at every city from an individual personally connected with the conflict. Speakers included the Gulu District Chairman [[Norbert Mao]], Invisible Children’s Ugandan Country Director '''Jolly Okot''', and the Senior Adviser to the International Crisis Group [[John Prendergast (activist)|John Prendergast]], among others. First Lady [[Laura Bush]] also directly addressed the Displace Me participants via a prerecorded speech shown on video. Participants concluded the night by writing letters to their government leaders and the President of Uganda, calling friends and family who were not aware of the conflict, as well as holding 21 minutes of silence for the 21 years of war.

During the night participants also helped film a video that was to be shown to members of the [[United States Senate]]. Participants in each city held up giant banners with their city's name and one to two phrases from the below statement.

Shortcuts in engineering design can lead to '''engineering disasters'''.  Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.&lt;ref&gt;"Engineering." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These demands include [[buildings]], [[aircraft]], [[Marine vessel|vessel]]s, and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively.  To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.

==Importance of safety==
In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as [[tensile testing]], [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dax|first=Mark|title=Failure Analysis Prevents Disaster Reoccurance|journal=R&amp;D Magazine|date=Dec 1997|pages=30–31|publisher=EBSOhost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of failure==
Failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function.&lt;ref&gt;"Failure." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; If a structure is designed to only support a certain amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], or loading and the user applies greater amounts, the structure will begin to deform and eventually fail. Several factors contribute to failure including a flawed design, improper use, financial costs, and miscommunication.

==Failure due to static loading==
[[File:Metal yield.svg|thumbnail|Stress–strain curve showing typical yield behavior for ductile metals. Stress (σ) is shown as a function of strain (ϵ). Stress and strain are correlated through Young's Modulus: σ=Eϵ where E is the slope of the linear section of the plot.]]
Static loading is when a force is applied slowly to an object or structure. Static load tests such as tensile testing, bending tests, and torsion tests help determine the maximum loads that a design can withstand without permanent deformation or failure. Tensile testing is common when calculating a stress-strain curve which can determine the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate strength]] of a specific test specimen.

[[File:Tensile testing on a coir composite.jpg|thumbnail|Tensile testing on a composite specimen]]

The specimen is stretched slowly in tension until it breaks, while the load and the distance across the gage length are continuously monitored. A sample subjected to a tensile test can typically withstand stresses higher than its yield stress without breaking. At a certain point, however, the sample will break into two pieces. This happens because the microscopic cracks that resulted from yielding will spread to large scales. The stress at the point of complete breakage is called a material’s ultimate tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doehring|first=James|first2=Lauren|last2=Fritsky|title=What Is a Static Load?|publisher=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a [[stress-strain curve]] of the material's behavior under static loading. Through this tensile testing, the yield strength is found at the point where the material begins to yield more readily to the applied stress, and its rate of deformation increases.&lt;ref name="Machine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Robert L.|title=Machine Design: An Integrated Approach|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure due to fatigue==
When a material undergoes permanent deformation from exposure to radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired.&lt;ref&gt;"CreepAbout Our Definitions: All Forms of a Word (noun, Verb, Etc.) Are Now Displayed on One Page." Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials" /&gt; This time–dependent plastic distortion of material is known as [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Stress and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be much less than the strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbeler|first=R. C.|title=Mechanics of Materials|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mechanical design, most failures are due to time-varying, or dynamic, loads that are applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] is known as the weakness in a material due to variations of stress that are repeatedly applied to said material.&lt;ref&gt;"Fatigue." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when stretching a rubber band to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the rubber band) the rubber band will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the rubber band with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the rubber band being snapped. The same principle is applied to mechanical materials such as metals.&lt;ref name="Machine" /&gt;

Fatigue failure always begins at a crack that may form over time or due to the manufacturing process used. The three stages of fatigue failure are: 
* 1.) Crack initiation- when repeated stress creates a fracture in the material being used
* 2.) Crack propagation- when the initiated crack develops in the material to a larger scale due to tensile stress.
* 3.) Sudden fracture failure- caused by unstable crack growth to the point where the material will fail

Note that fatigue does not imply that the strength of the material is lessened after failure. This notion was originally referred to a material becoming "tired" after cyclic loading.&lt;ref name="Machine"/&gt;

==Failure due to miscommunication==

Engineering is a precise discipline and in order to be precise, communication among project developers is pertinent for a successful product. There are several forms of miscommunication that can lead to a flawed design in a system. There are various fields of engineering that have to intercommunicate when working toward a mutual goal. These fields include civil, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, biological, and environmental engineering. When creating a modern automobile, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and environmental engineers are required to work together to produce a fuel-efficient, durable product for consumers. If engineers do not adequately communicate among one another, a potential design could have flaws and be unsafe for consumer purchase. '''Engineering disasters''' can be a result of such miscommunication. Such disasters include the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], and the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]].&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Richard D.|title=Investigation of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkways Collapse|location=Washington, D.C.|journal=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |publisher=United States Department of Defense |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: Defense Department Special Briefing on Efforts to Mitigate Infrastructure Damage from Hurricane Katrina |author1=Carl Strock |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001622/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

==Failure due to software==

Software has played a role in many high-profile disasters.

==Infamous disasters in engineering==
Engineering products and inventions are utilized everyday including computers, microwaves, and elevators. A broken microwave can have limited consequences; however, when larger projects such as infrastructures and airplanes fail, multiple people can be affected which leads to an '''engineering disaster'''. A disaster is defined as a calamity that results in significant damage which may include the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Disaster." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale engineering disasters are recorded in the history books. Just like any other mistake, these disasters become reminders and guidelines of how to improve and not repeat the same mistakes. In-depth observations and post-disaster analysis have been documented to a large extent to help prevent similar disasters from occurring.

[[File:HRWalkway.svg|thumbnail|left|Depiction of the modified design made by the fabricator]]

On the night of July 17, 1981, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[United States]], two suspended walkways of the [[Hyatt Regency Hotel]] collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 200 more. During this calamity, the hotel was hosting a dance competition. There were numerous competition attendants and observers standing and dancing on the suspended walkways when connections supporting the ceiling rods that hoisted both the second and fourth floor walkways across the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] failed and collapsed onto the crowded first floor atrium below.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2"&gt;"Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse." ENGINEERING.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During investigation after the walkway collapse, architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka noticed a substantial alteration of the original design. The fabricator constructed a double-rod support system rather than the originally designed single-rod system without approval of the engineering design team. In doing so, the created support beams doubled the loading on the connector which resulted in the failure of the walkway. It was documented that even the single-rod system would have barely supported the expected load and would not have met Kansas City Building Code standards.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2" /&gt;

The final analysis of the damage had several conclusions reported including:
* The maximum load capacity of the fourth floor walkway was only 53% the maximum load capacity of Kansas City Building Code standards
* The fabrication alterations from the original design doubled the load that was received by the fourth floor walkway
* The deformation and distortion of the fourth floor hanger rods support the notion that the collapse began at that point
* No evidence that the quality of construction or material selection played a role in the walkway collapse.&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt;

{{Main article|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster}}
The '''Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster''' occurred on January 28, 1986, when the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'' (OV-099)]] (mission [[STS-51-L]]) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. Disintegration of the vehicle began after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff.

====Columbia disaster (2003)====

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, while reentering Earth's atmosphere over [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The shuttle unexpectedly disintegrated, resulting in the death of all seven astronauts on board. The cause was later discovered to be damage to thermal shielding tiles from impact with a falling piece of foam insulation of an external tank during launch. It was the seventh known instance of this particular piece breaking free during launch.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Report Volume 1, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of Mach 23 (28,400km/h ; 17,647mph), the wing experienced temperatures of {{convert|2800|°F}}. The damage from the insulation strike experienced during launch proved fatal as the shuttle disintegrated during the mission return.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. L. M.|last2=R.|first2=Garud|title=Distributed Knowledge and Indeterminate Meaning: The Case of the Columbia Shuttle Flight|journal=Organization Studies|volume=30|issue=4|year=2009|pages=397–421|doi=10.1177/0170840608101142}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's investigation team found melted aluminum on the thermal tiles and inside edges of the left wing of the spacecraft, supporting the notion that the Columbia's destruction was due to hot gases that penetrated the damaged spot on the wing.&lt;ref&gt;"Molten Aluminum found on Columbia's thermal tiles". USA Today. Associated Press. March 4, 2003. Retrieved February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger L.M. Dunbar of [[New York University]] and Raghu Garud of [[Pennsylvania State University]] procured a case description of what missteps [[NASA]] had taken that led to the Columbia spacecraft catastrophe. Mission control deemed that foam shedding was a not a safety factor prior to launch, believed damage of the shuttle panels were not a significant issue which in-turn delayed analysis on damages as of January 17, 2003, and denied mission action request between January 18 and 19. It was not until January 24, 2003, that mission control had classified the damage as a problematic issue. These missteps in communication between mission control and the debris assessment team inhibited a proper examination of the damages to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

====Liberty ships in WWII====
{{Main article|Liberty ship}}
Early Liberty ships suffered [[Liberty ship#Hull cracks|hull and deck cracks]], and a few were lost to such structural defects. During World War II, there were nearly 1,500 instances of significant [[brittle fracture]]s. Three of the 2,710 Liberties built broke in half without warning. In cold temperatures the steel hulls cracked, resulting in later ships being constructed using more suitable steel.

====Steamboat Sultana (1865)====
{{Main article|Sultana (steamboat)}}

[[File:Sultana Disaster.jpg|thumbnail|Depiction of the steamboat Sultana disaster]]
On the night of April 26, 1865, the passenger steamboat Sultana exploded on the [[Mississippi River]] seven miles north of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This maritime disaster is categorized as the worst in [[United States]] history. The explosion resulted in the loss of 1,547 lives, surpassing the total number of deaths caused by the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''. The Sultana was overcrowded due to a soldier prisoner exchange towards the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. The overcrowding contributed significantly to the high death toll. Another reason for the high number of deaths is that the steamer was made mostly of wood, which was documented to have been completely engulfed in flames approximately seven minutes after the explosion. The explosion happened around midnight which was when the Mississippi River was at flood stage. It was documented that the single metal lifeboat on board the Sultana was thrown from the upperdeck landing on several people swimming from the steamer resulting in further deaths.&lt;ref name="Sultana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman |first=J.O. |last2=Potter |last3=Oliver |first3=S. |title=The Ill-Fated Passenger Steamer Sultana: An Inland Maritime Mass Disaster of Unparalleled Magnitude |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=JFSCA |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 1988 |pages=842–850 |url=http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au/JFS/PDF/vol_33/iss_3/JFS333880842.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster was believed to be the result of a repaired boiler explosion that led to the explosion of two of the three other boilers. The boiler had been previously found to have had a leak and was improperly repaired by boilermaker R.G. Taylor due to orders from Captain J. Cass Mason because of time constraints in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. While chief engineer Nathan Wintringer approved the repaired boiler, Taylor stated that the boiler could not be considered safe since the boiler appeared to be burned from being worked on with too little water.&lt;ref name="Sultana" /&gt; Traveling along the Mississippi River, the boiler exploded causing fire to spread throughout the steamer. The fire on board led to the collapse of both of the Sultana's smokestacks, killing many passengers. The sultanas captain died with the ship.

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the [[US-Mexico border|Mexico–United States border]], while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks.
The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston|first=Julia|date=30 June 2014|title=Texas: Panel Rules Agent Can Be Sued Over Shooting Teenager Across Border|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/texas-panel-rules-agent-can-be-sued-over-shooting-teenager-across-border.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2014|title=Court: Mexican family can sue over fatal Border Patrol shooting|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/07/01/court-mexican-family-can-sue-over-fatal-border-patrol-shooting/|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2014|title=Mexican teenager killed by US Border Patrol agents had rights, court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/mexican-teenager-killed-us-border-patrol-agents-constitution|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|date=9 Jun 2014|title=After Shootings, Extended Silence: What The Border Patrol Hasn't Said|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/09/320220093/foi-request-sheds-some-light-on-border-patrol-shootings|newspaper=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2017 |title=Supreme Court seems split over Mexican teen's shooting death by Border Patrol agent|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-seems-split-in-case-of-boys-death-near-us-mexico-border/|newspaper=[[CBS]]|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign resulted in a resolution by the [[United States Senate]] and contributed to the decision to send troops by the [[African Union]]. The film also called for an April 20 world wide canvassing campaign, called "Cover the Night". On April 5, 2012, Invisible Children released a follow-up video, titled ''[[#Kony 2012 Part II|Kony 2012: Part II&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Famous]]'', which failed to repeat the success of the original.

==''Kony 2012''==
The film documents the [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]]'s plans and efforts to capture [[Joseph Kony]]. It describes Kony's actions with his rebel militia group [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), including [[Impressment|forced recruitment]] of [[child soldiers]], and the regions (northern [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[South Sudan]]) in which they have been active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |title=KONY 2012, an Invisible Children film, to show on campus March 12 |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |date=March 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Penn State Altoona]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310034444/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |archivedate=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main people featured in the film is a young Ugandan named Jacob Avaye, whose brother was killed by the LRA. In response, director and founder of Invisible Children, [[Jason Russell]], promises Jacob that he will help "stop Kony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebs Help 'Stop Kony' Trend on Twitter: Who Is Kony? |author=Jenny McGrath |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/network/articles/celebs-help-stop-kony-tweet-on-twitter-who-is-kony |newspaper=[[Wetpaint]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible Children==
The Invisible Children charity has focused on obtaining the support of a select group of individuals in order to "help bring awareness to the abuse and killing of children in the [[East Africa|East]] and Central African countries at the hands of Kony and his leadership." This list included 20 "celebrity culture makers", such as [[George Clooney]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (who significantly helped to spread the video&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;), [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref name="E!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and You Asked to Save Africa's Invisible Children From Torture |author=Rebecca Macatee |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/kony_2012_george_clooney_angelina_jolie/299424 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basulto |first=Dominic |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/clooney-kony-soldiers-spy-satellites-celebrity-philanthropy-goes-high-tech/2012/03/30/gIQADM0MlS_blog.html |title=Clooney, Kony, soldier, spy: Celebrity activism goes high-tech&amp;nbsp;– Ideas@Innovations |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list also featured 12 "policy makers" that have "the power to keep U.S. government officials in Africa" in order to work toward the capture of Kony.

As part of the campaign, American supporters were asked to put up posters in their hometowns in an action named "Cover the Night", which took place on April 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/kony-2012-invisble-children-day-of-action |title=Kony 2012 organisers plan massive day of action across US cities |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Children website offers posters and T-shirts in an attempt to gain wider recognition. They also created action kits to help spread awareness that include campaign buttons, posters, bracelets and stickers.&lt;ref name="Lees0307"/&gt;

The "Cover the Night" event took place worldwide on April 20, 2012, and was to be conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family {{sic}} in their neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch Kony campaign loses couch potatoes |author=Nick Miller |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/catch-kony-campaign-loses-couch-potatoes-20120421-1xdqc.html |newspaper=The Age |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One gathering in [[Vancouver]] had only 17 people; another in [[Brisbane]] had fewer than 50 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 campaign fails to go offline in Vancouver |author=Mike Hager |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/kony+2012+campaign+fails+to+go+offline+in+vancouver/6442625789/story.html |newspaper=[[Global BC]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KONY 2012's struggle to remain visible |author=Chris Paine |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/kony-2012-how-the-phenomenon-faded/story-e6freuzr-1226334893369 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]], several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were "placed on both sides of the pedestrian overpass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kelowna makes Kony famous|url=http://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/148386225.html |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canberra]], several [[Facebook]] groups resulted in a few gatherings of two or three people each; [[Pierre Johannessen]], a "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 poster boy for Civic unrest |author=Douglas Fry |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kony-2012-poster-boy-for-civic-unrest-20120421-1xebl.html |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], 200 posters were put up by "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 supporters 'cover the night' in downtown Phoenix |url=http://downtowndevil.com/2012/04/21/26874/kony-2012-phoenix-uganda/ |newspaper=Downtown Devil |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

==Reception==
The film sparked a heated controversy regarding its merits, with very differing opinions being expressed by various [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] workers, government and international officials, journalists, and other groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08 |title=Efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WTF Was Kony 2012?

=== Social Media Response ===
After the video was released, various social media outlets went into a frenzy and exploded the Kony 2012 movement into the world-wide news.  The video, directed by [[Jason Russell]], began to generate a tremendous amount of social media attention.  After being the quickest video to reach 100 million views within 6 days,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kony 2012 took over social media with hashtags like #Kony2012. The social media impact was so relevant that, on March 6 and 7, more people were talking about Kony 2012 through Facebook posts than the newly released Apple iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.notothequo.com/kony-2012-social-media-case-study-stats-and-insights/|title=Kony 2012 Social Media Case Study {{!}} Stats and Insights - N2Q Consulting|date=2012-03-08|work=N2Q Consulting|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Facebook]], nearly 66% of Twitter conversations during March 5&amp;nbsp;– March 12 were about the Anti-Kony movement.  Social media outlets, such as Facebook, were responsible for informing 27% of young adults of the Kony 2012 video, compared to 10% who learned about it through other traditional platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/15/the-viral-kony-2012-video/|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|date=2012-03-15|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kony 2012 made a significant impact throughout social media platforms. During that short period of time, it became YouTube's number one video of reaching a certain number of views within a short period of time, along with over 5 million related tweets occurring over just a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/The_Viral_Kony_2012_Video.pdf|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=|website=Pew Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2012 Kony cumulative video views.png|thumb|Cumulative views on YouTube, showing a lower, though steady, view growth rate after its first ten days.&lt;ref name=WaybackKony/&gt;]]
In under a week, the video created by Invisible Children, Kony 2012 had been viewed over 100 million times.&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/kony-2012-documentary-becomes-most-viral-video-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine credits Invisible Children's strong base of followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Unlike other videos that accidentally "go viral", Kony 2012 was created to elicit emotional responses and encourage viewers to share the footage and spread the hashtag. This attracted the attention of celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Kim Kardashian-West]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the video's popularity, not all interactions were positive. But the more criticism the video drew, the more people watched it and shared it so that they could be a part of the conversation. Their Public Relations team was not ready for the over night fame and failed to control the narrative of the fall out.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Forbes gives a breakdown of 12 reasons why the video went so viral. They cite that the video invoked positive feelings, grabbed viewers attention, made it personal, referenced mainstream media, pulled on the heartstrings, conveyed immediacy, made it simple, made it real, gave it a scale, used celebrities, created events, and made it easy to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/03/09/12-lessons-from-kony-2012-from-social-media-power-users/#45f979dd4328&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 basic tactics affected viewers so much so that the Kony 2012 campaign sold out of merchandise when their two interns could not keep up with the hundreds of thousands of action kits supporters could buy. Jason Russel told Business Insider, "We sourced every single red T-shirt in the entire US. There were no more to buy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-guy-behind-the-kony-2012-video-finally-explains-how-everything-went-so-weird-2013-3?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; The google trends for searches like "Joseph Kony" and "Kony 2012" all show flatlines until the video was released where the spike reaches all the way to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=Kony%202012&lt;/ref&gt; Before Invisible Children released the video, Joseph Kony and the LRA were mostly unknown to America and the rest of the world.

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW)'s Africa division senior researcher [[Anneke Van Woudenberg]] wrote in a statement: "We've spent years investigating the horrors perpetrated by the LRA in central Africa—Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), and South Sudan. We gathered evidence at massacre sites—wooden clubs covered in dried blood, rubber strips from bicycle tires used to tie up the victims, and freshly dug graves—and spoke to hundreds of boys and girls forced to fight for his army or held captive as [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]]. And we're elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on [[Twitter]]—if anyone deserves global notoriety it's Kony." She added: "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge of one of the most brutal rebel groups in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/09/how-catch-joseph-kony |title=How to Catch Joseph Kony &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA."&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news|author1=Polly Curtis |author2=Tom McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story#block-14 |title=Kony 2012: what's the real story? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]], which had documented what it described as the LRA's "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," but added: "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect [[human rights]]", especially because "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

Opinions on the film were mixed in [[Gulu]], one of former centers of rebel activities in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Henry Oryem Okello]], said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were "unfounded", going on to state, "Invisible Children has done visible things in [[Acholi]][land], for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 video divides opinion in Gulu |author1=Sam Lawino |author2=Moses Akena |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1369072/-/ax98g6z/-/ |newspaper=Saturday Monitor |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Bigombe]], a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, "I do not know whether it makes any difference as far as taking [Kony] out is concerned.

Journalist [[Nicholas D.

He also said that complexity had long been "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so the simplicity of the film "has left the American public more informed" than it would be otherwise, and that if he "were a Congolese villager", he would "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics."&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |title=Viral Video, Vicious Warlord |author=[[Nicholas D.

Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from [[Clark University]]'s Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat [[consumerism|consumerist]]-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-luttrellrowland/consumerism-trumps-educat_b_1337067.html Consumerism Trumps Education: The Kony 2012 Campaign], ''Huffington Post'', November 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Africa researcher [[Alex de Waal]] accused the film of "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," criticized the campaign as "naive" for "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/03/10/dont-elevate-kony/ |title=Don't Elevate Kony &amp;#124; Reinventing Peace |publisher=Sites.tufts.edu |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One point of criticism is that the film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself was believed to be in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video.&lt;ref name="Keating20120307"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things |title=Guest post: Joseph Kony is not in Uganda (and other complicated things) |accessdate=March 8, 2012|date=March 7, 2012|work=Foreign Policy|author=Keating, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.&lt;ref name=infamous&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/08/148239201/joseph-kony-is-now-a-star-but-will-he-be-caught | title=Joseph Kony is Infamous&amp;nbsp;– But will he be caught? | publisher=NPR | accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinaw Mengestu]], an [[Ethiopian American]] writer and Africa researcher, wrote that the real world Kony is "not a click away", and a simple solution of raising popular awareness, "a beautiful equation that can only work so long as we believe that nothing in the world happens unless we know about it&amp;nbsp;... only works in the [[Myopia|myopic]] reality of the film, a reality that deliberately eschews depth and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/not-click-away-joseph-kony-real-world |title=Not a Click Away: Joseph Kony in the Real World |publisher=Warscapes |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amanda Weisbaum of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] said that "just getting rid of one person does not solve the problem" and the film's focus should have been rather on helping ex-child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child/ |title=Not enough focus on child soldiers’ lives in "Kony 2012" -War Child&amp;nbsp;– AlertNet |publisher=Trust.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705072012/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goddard, president and CEO of [[ChildFund|ChildFund International]], wrote that "by narrowing the focus on Kony, by defining success so singularly, it gives people a greater sense that the issue [of globally widespread conscription of young children] can be resolved.

After the film's release, there was criticism in Uganda of its failure to state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, "It is totally misleading to suggest that the war is still in Uganda."&lt;ref name="pflanz"/&gt; Arthur Larok, [[ActionAid]]'s director in Uganda, said, "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda.

A March 2012 mass showing of the film in [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], the site of one of Kony's worst atrocities in Uganda, was met with jeering and thrown objects at the screen and at the group African Youth Initiative Network, which screened the film and provided translations.

On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children released an official response addressing the criticisms directed at ''Kony 2012''. As an explanation for the simplicity of the movie, they stated that "in [their] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [they] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were "myopic" and that the video itself was a "tipping point" that "got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children responds to criticism about 'Stop Kony' campaign |author=Elizabeth Flock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html?wprss=blogpost |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army".

A video titled ''Thank you, KONY 2012 Supporters'' was released on March 12, 2012 to address the criticisms directed at the film and to be "fully transparent", according to Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey. The film begins with Keesey discussing the three things that the charity focuses on, which are to "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." He also points out that "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", as a part of the group's management expenses, along with going toward "thousands of free screenings of the group's films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord's Resistance Army&amp;nbsp;... to speak at these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children Releases New Video in Response to ‘Kony 2012’ Criticism |author=Samantha Grossman |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/invisible-children-releases-new-video-in-response-to-kony-2012-criticism/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" going toward {{"'}}program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony 2012: Invisible Children release new film responding to criticism |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9139970/Joseph-Kony-2012-Invisible-Children-release-new-film-responding-to-criticism.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via [[Twitter]], using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything.

===Reception===
In a pre-release comment, [[popular culture]] expert [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]] said: "The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not know before.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the sequel "does not seem to have captured the public's imagination in quite the same way as Invisible Children's earlier video did, failing to significantly trend on social media websites."&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt; By April 16, 2012, it had received 1.7 million views in 11 days, less than 2% of what the first video had in its first five days.

==Impact==

===United States===
On March 21, 2012, a resolution "condemning Joseph Kony and his ruthless guerrilla group for a 26-year campaign of terror" was put forward by [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jim Inhofe]] and [[Chris Coons]]. The resolution stated that it would back "the effort of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and the newest country, South Sudan, to stop Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army", along with an official statement of support "for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group." Overall, the resolution received support from 34 senators, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate pushes measure condemning Kony |author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/03/21/senate_pushes_measure_condemning_kony/|date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention |author=Scott Wong |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support among senators for the resolution came about after the release of the ''Kony 2012'' video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator [[Roy Blunt]] was informed "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], stated that, "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

===Africa===
{{see also|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency}}

On March 23, 2012, the [[African Union]] (AU) announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops "from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony's reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony" and to "neutralize" him.

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said the agency welcomed the "unprecedented" initiative to "end the atrocities in the region" and urged all involved to respect human rights and minimize risk to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/03/kony-lords-resistance-army-increased-attacks.html |title=Kony militia steps up attacks in Congo, Central African Republic |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AU [[counter-terrorism]] envoy Francisco Madeira said, "We need to stop Kony." The ICC chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] voiced confidence that the video will "produce the arrest of Joseph Kony this year," adding: "That is the impact of the campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/01/204536.html |title=Viral video will spur Kony arrest this year: ICC&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

A '''leap year''' (also known as an '''intercalary year''' or '''bissextile year''') is a [[calendar year]] containing one additional day (or, in the case of [[lunisolar calendar]]s, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the [[astronomical year|astronomical]] or [[seasonal year]].&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{citation|last1 = Meeus | first1=Jean | date = 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithims | publisher = Willmann-Bell | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'') an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox]].

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year - Definition of leap year in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English | accessdate = June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, and Monday in 2017, then it will fall on Tuesday in 2018, and Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of [[leap second]]s into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), owing to the variability of Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not entirely predictable.

[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar.]]
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K. Lee |last1=Lerner |first2=Brenda W. |last2=Lerner |title=Calendar |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science |year=2004 |publisher=[[Gale]] |location=Detroit, MI |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.&lt;ref name="usno"&gt;{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years. By this rule, the average number of days per year is 365&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|4}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{frac|100}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|400}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;365.2425.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{citation | last = Richards | first = E.

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = E.

===Algorithm===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS ALGORITHM ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES --&gt;

The following [[pseudocode]] determines whether a year is a ''leap year'' or a ''common year'' in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar before 1582). The ''year'' variable being tested is the integer representing the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the tests are arranged to dispatch the most common cases first. Care should be taken in translating mathematical integer divisibility into specific programming languages.

'''if''' (''year'' is not [[divisor|divisible]] by 4) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;

The algorithm applies to proleptic Gregorian calendar years before 1, but only if the year is expressed with [[astronomical year numbering]]. It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire.  The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.

===Leap day===
{{Main|February 29}}
[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]
[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]

February 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.

The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence "calendar") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

The Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', "twice sixth") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]
Until 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===
The Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.

The [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.

==Revised Julian calendar==
The [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.

==Chinese calendar==
The [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called "leap second month" i.e. {{zh|t=閏二月|s=闰二月|p=rùn'èryuè}}.

==Hebrew calendar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] --&gt;
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13&lt;/ref&gt; relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their "Law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} ("in order") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} ("lacking") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} ("filled") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendar==
The observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.&lt;ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu calendar==
In the [[Hindu calendar]], which is a lunisolar calendar, the embolismic month is called ''adhika maas'' (extra month). It is the month in which the sun is in the same sign of the stellar zodiac on two consecutive dark moons. ''Adhika maas'' occurs once every 33 to 34 months, compensating for the approximately eleven fewer days per year in twelve lunar months than the solar calendar. Thus, Hindu festivals tend to occur within a given span of the Gregorian calendar. For example: the No Moon during [[Diwali]] festival occurs between mid - October and mid - November. [[Buddhist calendar]]s in several related forms (each a simplified version of the Hindu calendar) are used on mainland Southeast Asia in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thai lunar calendar|Thailand]], [[Myanmar (formerly Burma)]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Hindu Calendar also known as [[Vikram Samvat]] is used in [[Nepal]] as the national calendar. All the official work is done based on this calendar.

The calendar followed in some parts of [[South India]] (mainly in [[Tamil Nadu]]) is [[Solar calendar|solar]]. It has a leap year every four years.

==Bahá'í calendar==
{{main | Bahá'í calendar }}
The Bahá'í calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of "Intercalary Days", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.

==Solar Hijri calendar==
{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}
The [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. The system used is more accurate and more complicated, and is based on the time of the March equinox as observed from [[Tehran]]. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

==Folk traditions==
[[File:Bob Satterfield cartoon about leap year traditions.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A [[spinster]] eagerly awaits the upcoming leap day, in this 1903 cartoon by [[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield.]]]]
In Ireland and Britain, it is a [[tradition]] that women may [[Proposal of marriage|propose marriage]] only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by [[Saint Patrick]] or [[Brigid of Kildare]] in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Mikkelson |first1=B. | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = D.P. | date = 2010 | url = http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/february29.asp | title = The Privilege of Ladies | website = The Urban Legends Reference Pages | publisher = snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Scotland]] (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1 and a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;Virtually no laws of Margaret survive. Indeed, none concerning her subjects are recorded in the twelve volume ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'' (1814–75) covering the period 1124–1707 (two laws concerning young Margaret herself are recorded on pages 424 &amp; 441–2 of volume I).&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, February 29, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, February 24.

According to Felten: "A play from the turn of the 17th century, 'The Maydes Metamorphosis,' has it that 'this is leape year/women wear breeches.' A few hundred years later, breeches wouldn't do at all: Women looking to take advantage of their opportunity to pitch woo were expected to wear a scarlet [[petticoat]] — fair warning, if you will."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Felten | first = E. | date = February 23, 2008 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120371485815386581 | title = The Bissextile b=Beverage | website = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the tradition is that if a man refuses a woman's proposal on leap day, he should buy her the fabrics for a skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hallett | first = S. | date = February 29, 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/27/leap-year-proposal-tradition_n_1305525.html | title = Leap Year Proposal: What's The Story Behind It? | website = Huffington Post | accessdate = December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, since 1980, a satirical newspaper entitled ''[[La Bougie du Sapeur]]'' is published only on leap year, on February 29.

In Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?la=eng&amp;pageID=151 | title = A Greek Wedding | website = Anagnosis Books | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in five engaged couples in Greece will plan to avoid getting married in a leap year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.developingteachers.com/tips/pasttips63.htm | title = Teaching Tips 63 | website = Developing Teachers | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988 the town of [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]] in Texas, declared itself "leap year capital of the world", and an international leapling birthday club was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/leap-year-capital.html|title=Anthony – Leap Year Capital of the World|publisher=Time and Date|date=2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthdays==
A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling" or a "leaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date =February 28, 2012 | article = February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day | title = Mirror | accessdate = December 7, 2015| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years, they usually celebrate their [[birthday]]s on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

===Republic of China===
{{Wikisource|Civil Code Part I General Principles}}
The Civil Code of the [[Republic of China]] since October 10, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Legislative History of the Civil Code of the Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:

{{quote|If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which precedes the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | article = Article 121 Civil Code | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Part I General Principles of the Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hong Kong===
Since 1990 non-retroactively, Hong Kong considers the legal birthday of a leapling March 1 in common years:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/E1BF50C09A33D3DC482564840019D2F4/22F10EC537B1BEBAC825648300339AA3?OpenDocument | title = Age of Majority (Related Provisions) Ordinance (Ch. 410 Sec. 5) | date = June 30, 1997 | publisher = Hong Kong Department of Justice}} (Enacted in 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
# The time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years shall be the commencement of the anniversary corresponding to the date of [their] birth.
# Where a person has been born on February 29 in a leap year, the relevant anniversary in any year other than a leap year shall be taken to be March 1.
# This section shall apply only where the relevant anniversary falls on a date after the date of commencement of this Ordinance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51760">This is a chronological list of conflicts in which [[peasant]]s played a significant role.

==Background==
History of peasant wars spans over a period of over two thousand years. A variety of reasons fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066157508437962|title=The Late  Medieval Peasant Wars|author=Frantisek Graus|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1080/03066157508437962|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tax resistance]] 
*[[Social inequality]] 
*[[Religious war]] 
*[[Wars of national liberation|National liberation]] 
*Resistance against [[serfdom]] 
*Redistribution of land
*External factors such as [[Black Death|plague]] and [[Great Famine of 1315-1317|famine]]

Later peasant revolts such as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] were also influenced by [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Maoism|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/804/001/Skocpol%201979%20What%20Makes%20Peasant%20Revolutionary.pdf|title=Review: What Makes Peasants Revolutionary?|author=Theda Skocpol|date=April 1982|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/bondeoproer/?tx_historyview_pi1[lang]=1&amp;cHash=f8911ce32f21435e54b5720e3e9db0f7|title=Peasant Rebellions|work=Danmarkshistorien-Aarhus University|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">{{short description|2016 hoax about marijuana cigarettes}}
{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">A '''media monitoring service''', a '''press clipping service''' or a '''clipping service''' as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor.  The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of [[telegraphy]] and [[submarine communication cable|submarine cables]] in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of [[radio]], [[television]], the [[photocopier]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed.  An existing group may provide such a monitoring service, as it relates to their main purpose, while a monitoring agency generally provides such as their main business.  Alternative terms for these monitoring services as well as the information they provide include:

*Press clipping service or agency
*Media cutting service or agency
*[[Information logistics]] service
*[[Media intelligence]]
*Media information services

==History==
{{See also|Imprimatur}}
Since [[mass media]] traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The world's first press clipping agency was established in [[London]] in 1852 by a Polish newsagent named Romeike. Actors, writers, musicians and artists would visit his shop to look for articles about themselves in his Continental stock. It was then that Romeike realised that he could turn this into a profitable business. 

An agency named "L'Argus de la presse" was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history Media Monitors Interactive history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430192851/http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[radio]] and later [[television]] broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. With the growth of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients.

Then, in 1998, the now defunct WebClipping&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webclipping.com WebClipping website]&lt;/ref&gt; website was the first firm to start monitoring Internet based news media, moving the industry toward tracking digital news quickly.

Typically, individual or organisational clients &amp;ndash; e. g. private companies and corporations, charities, government departments and ministries &amp;ndash; will subscribe to a media monitoring service to keep track of what is being said about them, their field of operations, their competitors, or other specified topics of interest.

==Industry==
The news monitoring industry provides government agencies, corporations, public relations professionals, and other organizations access to news information created by the media. Generally monitoring print, broadcast, and internet [[digital content|content]] for any mention of specific subjects of interest, a news monitoring company will analyze and provide feedback to their client in the form of press clippings, monitoring reports, and media analysis.

==Evolution==

From a cut &amp; clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information.  Media monitoring clients can now opt to include print, broadcast and online to capture all their media exposure.  While this technology has allowed some of the process to be automated, many media monitoring agencies still offer the services of trained professionals to review and validate results.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery.  Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break.  The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed &amp; compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their [[PR campaign]]s, to verify that PR, [[marketing]] and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or [[internet tracking]]. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index [[closed captioning]] text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called [[web spider|spiders]] or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services.  Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles.  Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service.  Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Language and media – the big challenges==

In English speaking countries, the service of media monitoring, [[collation]] &amp; [[dissemination]] is fairly simple and most organizations which use [[Public Relations]] also use media monitoring. However, in multi-language &amp; multi-dialect countries the challenge of collating data locally and disseminating in a [[language translation|translated]] language of business (usually English) is a daunting task. The situation in other multi-language countries is no different.

The second large challenge for Information Logistics is the growing number of media and the media types. For example, in a country like [[media in India|India]] there are over 50,000 registered print publications, 250+ TV channels, a growing number of relevant internet sites and several hundred new blogs that need to be captured every day. Several of these need to be translated for a 'heads-up' and analysis needs to be constant and real-time.

===Illustrative examples===
An author that recently published a book and who has a strong interest in tracking how well the book is received by [[critic]]s may hire a media monitoring service. The service will have a method by which they extract any information about the author and their book from newly printed [[magazine]]s, radio programs, television programs and so on. The author will receive a printed bundle of ''clippings'', i.e., the pages of the magazines and [[newspaper]]s relating to them and their book.  They may also receive recordings of any radio reviews, television programs and so on, which refer to his book.

Most major companies and corporations subscribe to media monitoring services to keep track of any reports or comments in the media. A fast food company, for example, would receive summaries of coverage and/or copies of material drawn from a wide range of sources, including TV and radio news reports, commentaries on TV and radio shows, newspaper opinion/commentary columns, magazine articles and internet [[blog]]s.

The material collected would include any media items that relate to the company's commercial operations, its corporate [[reputation management|reputation]] or its media image. This would include reports about or discussions of the [[fast food industry]] in general, and any media item that specifically mentions the company, its clients and suppliers, its competitors or related interest groups or other specified subjects of interest, such as food/health regulations.

===Trade groups===
The [[International Association of Broadcast Monitors]] (IABM) is a worldwide [[trade association]] made up of news retrieval services which record, monitor and archive broadcast news sources including television, radio and internet.  It acts as a "clearinghouse" or "forum" for discussion on topics of collective concerns and acts as a united voice for the news monitoring industry.

===Professional organization===
[[FIBEP]] (Federation Internationale des Bureaux d’Extraits de Presse/International Federation of the Press Clipping Services) is a professional media monitoring organization. The FIBEP was established in 1953 in [[Paris]] and has close to 100 members from 44 countries. Every 18 months, the members of FIBEP members organize a three-day FIBEP-Congress. In work groups, workshops, reports and discussion circles, members discuss market trends.

==Law cases==
{{main|Associated Press v. Meltwater|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
Two parallel cases developed in 2012, [[Associated Press v. Meltwater|one in the United States]], and [[Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)|one in the United Kingdom]]. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, [[Meltwater Group]]. The plaintiff differed, being [[List of copyright collection societies|a UK copyright collection society]] (UK) rather than [[Associated Press]] (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the "[[fair use]]" doctrine) and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law, in summary on the basis that mere viewing is never an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful).

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W.

Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."&lt;ref name="Rationally Speaking podcast"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Interview with Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef |url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs103-neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-he-doesnt-call-himself-an-a.html |website=Rationally Speaking podcast |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'', he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Neil deGrasse Tyson Returns Again |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Nerdist Podcast]] |last=Levine |first=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |title=Dear Neil deGrasse Tyson, don't be foolish about philosophy |date=June 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Chicago Now]] |last=Wall |first=James Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806031740/http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson Slammed For Dismissing Philosophy As 'Useless' |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[io9]] |last=Dvorsky |first=George |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328062312/http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |archivedate=March 28, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/ |title=The one thing Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |last=Neumann |first=Steve |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000625/http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/n|dead-url=no |archivedate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine |title=Why Neil deGrasse Tyson is a philistine |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |website=[[The Week]] |last=Linker |first=Damon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145135/http://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Value of Philosophy |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104308/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |archivedate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===

Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‘Tokyo bureau’ refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‘Washington bureau’ is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won’t Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.'' [http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47915">''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' is an online team-based [[first person shooter]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], and released worldwide in May 2016. Normally played in matches of six-vs-six, players select from one of [[Characters of Overwatch|29 heroes]], broadly classified into the three categories of Tank, Damage, and Support, and work with their team to attack or defend map objectives. Each hero has a unique set of weapons, abilities, and skills, which players can coordinate to overpower the other team. ''Overwatch'' supports both casual and ranked matchmaking, as well as a rotating set of arcade modes, and the game has since become a popular [[eSport]], featuring a professional [[Overwatch League]] that started in 2018. The game has been both a critical and financial success for Blizzard, exceeding over 30 million players and obtaining over $1 billion in revenue within its first year.

To support ongoing interest in the game, Blizzard has run several seasonal events, typically coinciding with worldwide events and holidays. These events last for two to three weeks, updating [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to incorporate elements of that theme, and provide new game modes along with the opportunity to acquire unique cosmetic options. Players keep their earned character cosmetic options after the event ends, but the rest of the themed elements return to normal.

== Overview ==
Over the course of developing ''Overwatch'', Blizzard opted against using a [[downloadable content]] model to extend the game and bring post-sale revenues, as they had developed the game around the mechanic of allowing players to switch out to new heroes during the course of a match as to meet current strategic conditions; by requiring players to purchase new heroes, such a model would have hampered this approach.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: Development"/&gt; Instead, they opted to include [[microtransaction]]s through which players can buy [[loot box]]es, which contain four randomized cosmetic items, including characters skins, victory poses, emotes, spray tags, highlight introductions, and player icons. This allowed them to create an incentivized [[experience level|level progression system]] that would reward players with a loot box for every level they earned from experience gained in playing matches.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Progression"/&gt; Working alongside this, players can earn in-game coins through some loot box rewards or as a consolation prize for receiving a duplicate loot box reward. These coins can be used to purchase any of the available cosmetic items (with the exception of player icons), the cost reflecting the rarity of obtaining the item through a loot box.

Beginning in August 2016, Blizzard began introducing seasonal events, starting with the Summer Games event which corresponded with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. ''Overwatch''{{'}}s director Jeff Kaplan said the goal of these seasonal events was to make the game "feel alive", correlating with real-world events.&lt;ref name="VG247: Seasonal"/&gt; The company has a history of creating in-game seasonal events, such as the Valentine's Day and New Year's events in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Other competitor games, such as ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', also implement in-game seasonal events.&lt;ref name="IGN: more"/&gt;

Events have generally included at least one new game mode, which typically is only available to play while that event is active; one exception is the "Capture the Flag" mode introduced during the Chinese New Year event in early 2017, which has been brought back to the game as a permanent feature in the game's casual Arcade matchmaking mode. Players are typically rewarded with loot boxes for playing matches in these seasonal game modes, and the game offers unique [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and associated cosmetic rewards for completing certain goals within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/173914/overwatch-uprising-achievements-how-to-unlock-all-the-new-event-sprays#.m0kj9F4sw|title=How to unlock all the new 'Overwatch' sprays during the Uprising event|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to new games modes, these seasonal events include unique cosmetic items that can be obtained primarily during the event. Blizzard develops a large amount of content for these events, not all which ends up available to players.&lt;ref name="USGamer: Events 2017"/&gt; Initially, these items could only be obtained through event-themed loot boxes that are guaranteed to contain at least one event-themed item, which could either be earned through leveling up, completing the event game modes, or through microtransactions;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer"/&gt; however, in response to player feedback and avoid an apparent [[paywall]] access to these items, Blizzard allowed players to purchase these items with in-game currency at a higher cost than a non-event item of the same rarity, starting from the second seasonal event onward.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer Problem"/&gt; When the event is completed, the themed loot boxes and cosmetic items are no longer are available until the event is run again. However, players retain and can use all unique event items they have earned after the event.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; Not all event items will be limited in this manner, as Blizzard plans to have certain event items be possible loot obtained from a regular loot box in the future.&lt;ref name="Kotatu: Special Skins to Regular Loot"/&gt;

Several seasonal events, such as Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland, have recurred. However, on bringing these events back, the development team has added new changes to the event to keep them fresh and to reflect any new heroes or other content added to the game since the previous event's occurrence; for example, the 2017 Halloween "Junkenstein's Revenge" included a new endless mode and support for some of the newer heroes.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Returning Seasonal"/&gt; Recurring events also feature new themed cosmetic items for these recurring events, along with the return of the previous cosmetics which can be found in the event loot boxes or bought for a reduced coin amount.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; Not all seasonal events are designed for recurrence, such as the lore-heavy "Uprising" event which took place in April 2017. Kaplan said that Blizzard has plans as to how these events will evolve in the future.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2016 events ==
=== Summer Games ===

In August 2016, Blizzard released its first seasonal event in celebration of the concurrent [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Both Blizzard's "Summer Games" and the Olympics ran throughout the month. Summer Games added 100 new cosmetic character options and a new game mode, Lúcioball.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;

Lúcioball was designed as a futuristic [[soccer]] game in which two teams of three Lúcio characters attempt to push a ball into their opponents' goal. Played in four-minute matches on the special stadium map, Estádio das Rãs, players use two kinds of attacks to control the ball's movements: primarily, a melee attack and a secondary, powerful sonic boom that could knock back opponents as well (frequently called "booping" by players). Players can also use the level's environmental perks (e.g., jump pads and speed-boosting walls) to secure strategic advantage on the field.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' felt that the mode felt closer to a "multiplayer carnival game than a fleshed-out, standalone mode".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror ===

Blizzard released its second seasonal event for [[Halloween]], which lasted throughout the month of October 2016. It included over 100 new cosmetic items (in [[jack-o'-lantern]]-themed loot boxes) and the game's first [[player versus environment|game mode against computer players]], Junkenstein's Revenge.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt; Several characters received new Halloween-themed cosmetic skins. ''PC Gamer'' wrote that they were among the game's best add-ons,&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt; and ''[[Kill Screen]]'' felt the new character skins were much more enjoyable compared to those offered for the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen: Halloween"/&gt; Players could now purchase the seasonal add-ons with in-game credits (at a premium), in response to criticism Blizzard received from players during the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt;

In Junkenstein's Revenge, four players [[co-op video game|cooperatively]] guard a castle door from oncoming waves of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. Set in a themed section of the game's Eichenwalde map, players select a [[difficulty level]] and choose between the characters [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]], [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]], [[McCree (Overwatch)|McCree]], and [[Soldier:_76]], before fighting off approaching mindless "zomnic" drones, long-range "zombardiers," exploding tires, and costumed versions of the characters [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], [[Symmetra (Overwatch)|Symmetra]], [[Mercy (Overwatch)|Mercy]], and [[Junkrat]] (as the titular Dr. Junkenstein).&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; The game mode includes new voice work and is based on a companion comic book released concurrently.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

The new mode was generally praised by commentators. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that the event resembled a similar event run on the team shooter ''Team Fortress 2'' since 2012. Though the reviewer found the Junkenstein mode pleasant, he wrote that in comparison to ''Team Fortress 2''{{'s}} [[Mann vs. Machine]] mode, Junkenstein felt "shallow" and similar to Lúcioball in its simplistic map flow, giving little room for player movement. He also wondered why the mode was limited to four specific characters.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Robert Purchase found the event fun and considered it a good distraction from ''Overwatch''{{'}}s main modes, but also recognized that if it was kept on after the Halloween Terror event, it would become a stale game mode.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Halloween"/&gt; Heather Alexandra for  ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the mode demonstrated that a co-operative player-versus-environment mode would fit well as a permanent feature within ''Overwatch'' as it required good team coordination to complete more challenging matches.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween"/&gt;

The event ended a few hours earlier than had been planned, leaving some players upset as they were waiting for as long as possible collecting the themed loot boxes in-game before trying to spend in-game coins or purchasing loot boxes to get the cosmetic items they were missing.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween early end"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland ===
The holiday-themed Winter Wonderland event ran for the latter half of December 2016 through the first days of the new year. Like previous events, it added over 100 themed cosmetic items for players to obtain via loot boxes or in-game currency, as well as provided snowy versions of two of the game's maps.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; One cosmetic items included the first Legendary skin for Mei since the game's release, a Santa-like outfit; with this skin equipped, it also changed the appearance of Mei's Cryo-Freeze from a simple block of ice to a frozen snowman.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Players criticized the skin, feeling that it did not vary as much from Mei's normal outfits and appeared to be a simple recoloring of her default skin, in comparison to what other characters' Legendary skins had been.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Blizzard admitted that their "'cool meter' was off" when they designed this skin, believing that players would take to the Cryo-Freeze effect as a reason to value the skin. Blizzard stated that they had plans for another Mei Legendary skin, along the lines of what players would expect, in early 2017.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei Response"/&gt;

The event featured a new [[deathmatch]] mode called "Mei's Snowball Offensive". The mode took place on the smaller Ecopoint: Antartica map, introduced in the previous months for standard deathmatch play. Six players each play Mei, but where her Endothermic Blaster, which normally fires a stream of damaging cold, can only fire a single snowball. Players must find a snowball pile scattered around the map to reload the weapon. Further, her Ultimate ability allows her to fire a machine-gun-like string of snowballs for a brief period. Otherwise, Mei's other abilities (Ice Wall and Cyro-Freeze) remain the same. A single snowball hit kills the struck until the round is complete.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; Kotaku claims this mode was generally not well received by players as the act of having to reload the Blaster made one too vulnerable, and with the [[permadeath]] mechanic in play, the mode was not fun nor captured the spirit of a snowball fight.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter"/&gt;

== 2017 events ==
=== Year of the Rooster ===
A [[Chinese New Year]]-themed event launched a few days before the actual holiday on January 28, 2017, and centered on celebrating the Year of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]. As with past events, the Chinese New Year event introduced over 100 new cosmetic items, including the promised new Legendary skin for Mei to make up for the poorly-received one she had gotten during the Winter Wonderland event.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY"/&gt; Other skins for Roadhog, Reinhardt, Winston and Zenyatta alluded to the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Leak"/&gt;

The event introduced the first [[Capture the Flag]] mode for ''Overwatch'' called "Capture the Rooster"; Blizzard had looked at adding such a mode for a few years during ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development but had difficulty with the mechanics due to the vastly different set of abilities offered by the characters that could imbalance the mode towards fast-moving characters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF"/&gt; Played on the Lijiang Tower map, normally used for Control modes, each team has a flag near their base. To capture the other opponent's flag, a character must stay near the flag and not take damage for a few seconds. Once they have taken the flag, they then must return it to their team's base, scoring a point if they do so. If they die while bringing the flag back, either a teammate can try to capture it, or the opposing team must stay near the flag, avoiding taking damage for a few seconds, to return it to their base. Teams can score with the opposing team's flag even if their team's flag has been taken. The first team to three scores, or the team with the highest score after five minutes, wins the match.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Start"/&gt;

Following the event, Blizzard introduced a more general Capture the Flag mode, playable on any of the Control maps, into the Arcade modes as well as making it an option for custom games with several adjustable parameters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF added"/&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Uprising ===
Uprising ran for most of the month of April 2017, and was the first seasonal event not tied to any real-world event, but instead used to expand the lore of ''Overwatch''. The story centered around one of the last official missions of the Overwatch team before they were disbanded—having to end the threat of a hostile Omnic force known as the Null Sector in its attack on the citizens of London—; which also happened to be [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]]'s first mission. Over 100 new cosmetic items were added with this event, many based on the uniforms and backstory of the original Overwatch forces.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt; A digital comic retelling this story was released alongside the event.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt; According to Kaplan, the Uprising event was something Blizzard felt had been asked for by players since they started offering the seasonal events. Players had requested non-holiday-themed events, as well as sought more details on the setting and history of the ''Overwatch'' world.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt;

The event added a new cooperative player-versus-environment mode called "Uprising", played on the King's Row map set in London. In the standard mode, which can be played at one of four difficulty levels, four players select from the characters of Tracer, [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]], [[Torbjörn (Overwatch)|Torbjörn]], and Mercy. From there, the players are directed by in-game narration to take several control points while fighting against waves of Null Sector Omnics that try to stop them. Eventually, they must then escort an explosive weapon to a sealed door in order to access the heart of the Null Sector facility and end their threat for good. If a player was downed, any of the other still-surviving players could help them up by interacting with that character for a few moments (or through Mercy's Ultimate ability of Resurrection). If all four players are downed, or the explosive is destroyed before reaching the sealed doors, the round ends as a loss.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising"/&gt;  A separate mode allowed players to complete the same mission without being limited in character selection, but without any of the character-specific dialogue; Blizzard added this based on feedback from Junkenstein's Revenge, so as to provide a less restrictive way to enjoy the game mode.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising"/&gt;

The Uprising mode was considered a much-improved version of a player-versus-environment mode compared to Junkenstein's Revenge from the Halloween event. Cecilia D'Anastasio for ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt the mode was much more dynamic since it required players to move throughout the map rather than stay in one general location, and as the four default characters represent a balanced team, the mode calls for more careful teamwork and strategy. D'Anastasio also felt that with new voice lines to support this mode, it helped to establish the game's lore for players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising Review"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' argued that the Uprising event demonstrated the potential for a strong team-based story-driven campaign developed within the ''Overwatch'' narrative.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising Review"/&gt;

The event had mistakenly ended a few hours earlier than expected on May 1, 2017; Blizzard apologized and extended the event for an additional day into May 2 to allow players to finish acquiring and purchasing the event loot boxes and skins.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising Ended"/&gt;

While the event was just named "Uprising" at its release, Blizzard stated in 2018 that they considered it to be the first "''Overwatch'' Archive" annual event that will be used to explore the history of the characters and narrative.&lt;ref name="polygon archives"/&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The Anniversary event, ran from the end of May 2017, celebrated ''Overwatch''{{'}}s first year since release. Gameplay-wise, it added three new Arena maps used for the smaller-scale Elimination games, and which will remain in rotation after the events' conclusion. The Eliminate mode also received two variants. In one-on-one "Limited Duel" matches, each player is presented with the same selection of three random heroes for play for that round. In three-on-three "Lockout Elimination", the heroes used by the winning team on a round are locked out for the next round.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt;

In addition, over one hundred new cosmetic items are available, including new dancing emotes for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt; The dance emotes were found to evoke references to popularized dance moves in other works, such as Mei's dance being similar to the "Hare Hare Yukai" dance used at the end credits for the anime ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance 2"/&gt;

=== Summer Games 2017 ===
A second Summer Games event was held from August 8 to August 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt; This event brought back the 3-on-3 soccer-like mode, Lucioball, introduced from the first Summer Games, adding additional arenas for the event to be played in, but removing the ability to "boop" other players.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; In addition to casual matchmaking for Lucioball, Blizzard also introduced a ranked play system for Lucioball, separate from the game's normal Competitive mode. By participating in this "Copa Lucioball" mode, players earned Competitive Points (CP), the same in-game currency earned playing Competitive matches, and used towards purchasing special weapon skins (such as golden weapons).&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

The previous skins and other cosmetic items offered from the first Summer Games were made available again to obtain in loot crates or purchasable from in-game coins at a lower cost, while additional Summer Games skins were added, purchasable at their normal cost.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2017 ===
The Halloween Terror 2017 event ran from October 10 to November 2, 2017. The event brought back "Junkenstein's Revenge" from the previous year's event, but added an endless-mode variant that challenges players to defend the door through as many waves as possible. This mode allowed players to have four additional characters to select from, Genji, Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta, in addition to McCree, Soldier: 76, Ana, and Hanzo. Teams lasting the longest were tracked via an online scoreboard.&lt;ref name="VG247: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event, along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror. With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event, all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in-game coin purchase. Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters' personalities, but still allowed players to purchase them in-game.&lt;ref name="Dot Esports: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland 2017 ===
The winter-focused "Winter Wonderland 2017" event ran from December 12, 2017 through January 1, 2018. It brought back the previous year's "Winter Wonderland" content, including the "Mei Snowball Offensive" mode and previous cosmetic items, along with new skins and other cosmetics. It also added a new Arcade mode, "Yeti Hunter". In this [[asymmetric gameplay|asymmetric mode]], five players, each playing as [[Mei (Overwatch)|Mei]], attempt to defeat one player controlling [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]] (acting as the Yeti) in a boss battle on Nepal's Village stage. Yeti Hunt is the first Overwatch mode to use role selection; players can indicate their preference to play as a Mei or as the Yeti. The Winston player must elude the Mei team, which can freeze him, use ice walls to impede his movement, or catch him in a snare trap (which replaces Mei's usual Ultimate). After collecting four pieces of meat, which spawn randomly in predetermined locations around the map, Winston unleashes his Ultimate ability for a short period which temporarily boosts his health, reduces his jump cooldown, and gives him powerful melee attacks. When a Mei player dies, they will respawn after a short delay and cost their team a life. The match is over once the Mei team either defeats Winston or loses all five of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter 2017"/&gt; Kaplan described the Yeti Hunt as a light-hearted mode to be played for a few matches rather than hundreds of hours.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2018 events ==
=== Year of the Dog ===
The Chinese New Year event reoccurred from February 8 to March 5, 2018, now reflecting the Year of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]].&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/lunar-new-year-seasonal-event-returns-to-overwatch-next-week-w516267 | title = Lunar New Year Seasonal Event Returns to 'Overwatch' Next Week | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cosmetic items relating to the theme were released, in addition to the existing cosmetics from the previous event. A new map, "Ayutthaya", inspired by [[Thailand]] and specifically designed for the Capture the Flag mode, was introduced in this event. Additionally, new Capture the Flag rules for all modes were updated, replacing the potential to have these end as draws by instead playing tie-breaking rounds with the teams' flags starting closer to each other on each subsequent round. The changes also eliminated the short period before players could pick up the flag, now able to pick up the flag instantaneously, but any use of a character's active skills or ultimate abilities that provide mobility or invulnerability would force them to drop the flag, and render the flag unable to be picked up for a few moments. These changes were to make games feel "much more offensive, and much more action-packed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/this-week-s-year-of-the-dog-event-in-overwatch-will-bring-a-new-map-486573.phtml | title = This week's Year of the Dog event in Overwatch will bring a new map | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a competitive mode for Capture the Flag, following a similar format as the competitive Lucioball mode in the 2017 Summer Games event, was run during the event, rewarding players with Competitive Points and unique items for the end-of-event placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/overwatch-celebrates-lunar-new-year-with-new-map-w516551 | title = 'Overwatch' Celebrates Lunar New Year With New Map and Capture The Flag Mode | first = Blake | last= Hester | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the event, Blizzard featured its inaugural "Puppy Rumble", modeled after the ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', on February 19, 2018, featuring puppies dressed in ''Overwatch'' character outfits in mock events. All of the animals during the event were put up for adoption through the event's co-sponsor [[Petfinder]], as well as promoting animal adoption through other local adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-puppy-rumble-celebrates-the-year-of-the-dog-with-real-dogs/ | title = The Overwatch 'Puppy Rumble' celebrates the Year of the Dog with real dogs | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Retribution ===
The ''Overwatch'' Archive event from the previous year returned, and ran from April 10, 2018. It brought back the narrative-driven player-versus-environment mode introduced in Uprising. It also featured a new mode titled "Retribution", which will take place on a new map, Rialto, which entered the game's map rotation as a Payload map outside of the Retribution event, on May 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-map-rialto-is-launching-this-week-f/1100-6458660/ | title = Overwatch's New Map, Rialto, Is Launching This Week For Everyone | first =Eddie | last = Makuch | date = May 1, 2018 | accessdate = May 1, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a four-player co-operative mode, based on the characters Reaper, McCree, Moira, and Genji as they escape from Talon forces; alternatively, this mode also includes an All-Hero mode where players can select any of the available characters. New skins and cosmetic items were available in loot boxes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/29/17176928/overwatch-uprising-event-start-date-2018 | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns in April | first = Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = March 29, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns as Overwatch Archives | first=  Ryan | last = Gilliam | date = April 2, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/4/4/17193808/overwatch-archives-retribution-trailer-reveal-pve | title = Overwatch Archives: Retribution is this year’s Blackwatch PVE brawl | first=  Ryan | last = Gillian | date = April 4, 2018 | accessdate =April 4, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Retribution event was aimed to provide a more replayable experience compared to the prior Uprising event. This included eliminating the waypoint approach they as to reduce elements on the user interface and instead allow players to naturally figure out how to progress in the mission. They also included "specials", unique enemies with special abilities to pose an immediate threat to the players rather than just waves of strong enemies, and included an enemy [[artificial intelligence]] systems to better react to players, including in the All-Hero mode. Much of the ideas of this mode were based on concepts from the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-retribution-development-heroes-specials-hanzo | title = Left 4 Dead was "a huge inspiration" for Overwatch Retribution | first = Matt | last=  Purslow | date = April 12, 2018 | accessdate = April 12, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary 2018 ===
The second anniversary event ran from May 22 to June 11, 2018. Also with new cosmetic items, the event included a limited time competitive [[deathmatch]] mode with an exclusive map, Petra. In addition to previous Anniversary cosmetic items, all Anniversary loot boxes included cosmetic items from all previous seasonal events, and these are also available to buy with in-game gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/14/17348534/overwatch-second-anniversary-event-cosmetics-deathmatch-details | title = Overwatch’s second anniversary event starts May 22 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date =  May 15, 2018 | accessdate = May 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-skins-and-more-out-now-with-annivers/1100-6459128/ | title = New Overwatch Skins And More Out Now With Anniversary Event | first=  Patrick | last=  Faller | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = May 24, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Games 2018 ===
The third Summer Games event ran from August 9–30, 2018. The Lucioball event returned with a new stadium map based on [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/8/2/17646222/overwatch-summer-games-2018-august-9th | title= Overwatch’s Summer Games return August 9th | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 2, 2018 | accessdate = August 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2018 ===
The 2018 iteration of Halloween terror ran from October 10–31, 2018. The Dr. Junkenstein's Revenge mode was updated to include changes made throughout the previous year, such as the changes to Symmetra. The player-versus-environment map remained largely unchanged, with the 2 modes and 4 difficulties each of the last year's event. Brigitte and Tracer were made playable for the game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/1/17922306/overwatch-halloween-terror-2018-event-date | title = Halloween Terror returns to Overwatch on October 9 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Joan''', 855–857, (''Ioannes Anglicus'') was, according to popular legend, a woman who reigned as [[pope]] for a few years during the [[Middle Ages]]. Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boureau |first=  Alain|translator= Lydia G.

Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession, and she died shortly after, either through murder or natural causes. The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot, and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 1–2|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

[[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle, written around 1250, contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope, and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years. The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'', later in the 13th century. Martin introduced details that the female pope's birth name was John Anglicus of [[Mainz]], that she reigned in the 9th century, and that she entered the church to follow her lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 6–7|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century, when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page= 14|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

==Legend==
The earliest mention of a female pope appears in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle of [[Metz]], ''Chronica Universalis Mettensis'', written in the early 13th century. In his telling, the female pope is not named, and the events are set in 1099. According to Jean:

{{quote|Query: Concerning a certain Pope or rather female Pope, who is not set down in the [[list of popes]] or Bishops of Rome, because she was a woman who disguised herself as a man and became, by her character and talents, a curial secretary, then a Cardinal and finally Pope. One day, while mounting a horse, she gave birth to a child. Immediately, by Roman justice she was bound by the feet to a horse's tail and dragged and stoned by the people for half a league, and, where she died, there she was buried, and at the place is written: "Petre, Pater Patrum, Papisse Prodito Partum" [Oh Peter, Father of Fathers, Betray the childbearing of the woman Pope]. At the same time, the four-day fast called the "fast of the female Pope" was first established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breverton|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Breverton's Phantasmagoria: A Compendium of Monsters, Myths and Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2n5YdVTW0z8C&amp;pg=PT81|year=2011|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0762770236|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jean de Mailly|Chronica Universalis Mettensis}}

Jean de Mailly's story was picked up by his fellow Dominican [[Stephen of Bourbon]], who adapted it for his work on the ''Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost''. However, the legend gained its greatest prominence when it appeared in the third ''recension'' (edited revision) of [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'' later in the 13th century. This version, which may have been by Martin himself, is the first to attach a name to the figure, indicating that she was known as "John Anglicus" or "John of Mainz." It also changes the date from the 11th to the 9th century, indicating that Joan reigned between [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] and [[Pope Benedict III|Benedict III]] in the 850s. According to the ''Chronicon'':

{{quote|John Anglicus, born at Mainz, was Pope for two years, seven months and four days, and died in Rome, after which there was a [[Sede vacante|vacancy in the Papacy]] of one month. It is claimed that this John was a woman, who as a girl had been led to Athens dressed in the clothes of a man by a certain lover of hers. There she became proficient in a diversity of branches of knowledge, until she had no equal, and, afterward in Rome, she taught the liberal arts and had great masters among her students and audience. A high opinion of her life and learning arose in the city; and she was chosen for Pope. While Pope, however, she became pregnant by her companion. Through ignorance of the exact time when the birth was expected, she was delivered of a child while in procession from [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] to the [[Lateran]], in a lane once named Via Sacra (the sacred way) but now known as the "shunned street" between the [[Colosseum]] and [[Basilica of San Clemente|St Clement's church]]. After her death, it is said she was buried in that same place. The Lord Pope always turns aside from the street, and it is believed by many that this is done because of abhorrence of the event. Nor is she placed on the list of the Holy Pontiffs, both because of her female sex and on account of the foulness of the matter.|Martin of Opava|Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum}}

One version of the ''Chronicon'' gives an alternative fate for the female pope. According to this, she did not die immediately after her exposure, but was confined and deposed, after which she did many years of penance. Her son from the affair eventually became [[Bishop of Ostia]], and ordered her entombment in his cathedral when she died.

Other references to the female pope are attributed to earlier writers, though none appears in manuscripts that predate the ''Chronicon''. The one most commonly cited is [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (d. 886), a compiler of ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', who was a contemporary of the female Pope by the ''Chronicon'''s dating. However, the story is found in only one unreliable manuscript of Anastasius. This manuscript, in the [[Vatican Library]], bears the relevant passage inserted as a footnote at the bottom of a page. It is out of sequence, and in a different hand, one that dates from after the time of Martin of Opava. This "witness" to the female pope is likely to be based upon Martin's account, and not a possible source for it. The same is true of [[Marianus Scotus]]'s ''Chronicle of the Popes'', a text written in the 11th century. Some of its manuscripts contain a brief mention of a female pope named Johanna (the earliest source to attach to her the female form of the name), but all these manuscripts are later than Martin's work. Earlier manuscripts do not contain the legend.

Some versions of the legend suggest that subsequent popes were subjected to an examination whereby, having sat on a so-called ''sedia stercoraria'' or "dung chair" containing a hole, a cardinal had to reach up and establish that the new pope had [[testicle]]s, before announcing "''Duos habet et bene pendentes''" ("He has two, and they dangle nicely"),&lt;ref name="Clément1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clément|first=Catherine|title=Opera: The Undoing of Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc4HeHS3ulMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=978-0-8166-3526-9|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''habet''" ("he has them") for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroy|first=Fernand|title=Histoire de naître: de l'enfantement primitif à l'accouchement médicalisé|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aqgvIsStVsC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2001|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|isbn=978-2-8041-3817-2|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were associated legends as well. In the 1290s, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Robert of Uzès]] recounted a vision in which he saw the seat "where, it is said, the pope is proved to be a man". Pope Joan has been associated with marvelous happenings. [[Petrarch]] (1304&amp;ndash;74) wrote in his ''Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani'' that after Pope Joan had been revealed as a woman:

{{quote|... in Brescia it rained blood for three days and nights. In France there appeared marvelous locusts, which had six wings and very powerful teeth. They flew miraculously through the air, and all drowned in the British Sea. The golden bodies were rejected by the waves of the sea and corrupted the air, so that a great many people died.|Petrarch|Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani}}

However, the attribution of this work to Petrarch may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronica delle vite de pontefici et imperatori romani|url=http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_3544172|website=Franklin: Penn Libraries Catalog|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=24 January 2015|quote=The attribution to Petrarch is doubtful. 'Cette oeuvre est généralement considérée comme apocryphe.' – Bib. Nat. cat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
[[Image:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|upright|An untitled [[The High Priestess|popess]] on the ''Rosenwald Sheet'' of uncut [[Tarot]] woodcuts. Early 16th-century. Now in [[National Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]
From the mid-13th century onward, the legend was widely disseminated and believed. Joan was used as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preaching. [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the scholar who was prefect of the Vatican Library, wrote his ''Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX'' in 1479 at the behest of his patron, [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The book contains the following account of the female Pope:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pope John VIII: John, of English extraction, was born at Mentz ([[Mainz]]) and is said to have arrived at popedom by evil art; for disguising herself like a man, whereas she was a woman, she went when young with her paramour, a learned man, to Athens, and made such progress in learning under the professors there that, coming to Rome, she met with few that could equal, much less go beyond her, even in the knowledge of the scriptures; and by her learned and ingenious readings and disputations, she acquired so great respect and authority that upon the death of [[Pope Leo IV]] (as Martin says) by common consent she was chosen pope in his room. As she was going to the Lateran Church between the [[Colosseum|Colossean Theatre]] (so called from [[Nero]]'s Colossus) and St. Clement's her travail came upon her, and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month, and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure authors, and therefore I have related it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertinacious if I had admitted what is so generally talked. I had better mistake with the rest of the world, though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Pope Joan - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pope Joan giving birth. Woodcut from a German translation by Heinrich Steinhöwel of Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', printed by Johannes Zainer at Ulm ca. 1474 ([[British Museum]])]]
References to the female Pope abound in the later [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote about her in ''[[De mulieribus claris|De Mulieribus Claris]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 99: "De Ioannae Anglica Papa;" it begins succinctly "Ioannes esto Vir nomine videbature, sexu tamen fœmina fuit."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adam of Usk]] (1404) gives her a name, Agnes, and furthermore mentions a statue in Rome that is said to be of her. This statue had never been mentioned by any earlier writer anywhere; presumably it was an actual statue that came to be taken to be of the female pope. A late-14th-century edition of the ''Mirabilia Urbis Romae'', a guidebook for pilgrims to Rome, tells readers that the female Pope's remains are buried at St. Peter's. It was around this time that a long series of busts of past Popes was made for the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo of Siena]], which included one of the female pope, named as "Johannes VIII, Foemina de Anglia" and included between Leo IV and Benedict III.

At his trial in 1415, [[Jan Hus]] argued that the Church does not necessarily need a pope, because, during the pontificate of "Pope Agnes" (as he also called her), it got on quite well. Hus's opponents at this trial insisted that his argument proved no such thing about the independence of the Church, but they did not dispute that there had been a female pope at all.

==During the Reformation==
In 1587, [[Florimond de Raemond]], a magistrate in the [[parlement]] de Bordeaux and an [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], published his first attempt to deconstruct the legend, ''Erreur Populaire de la Papesse Jeanne'' (also subsequently published under the title ''L'Anti-Papesse''). The tract applied humanist techniques of textual criticism to the Pope Joan legend, with the broader intent of supplying sound historical principles to ecclesiastical history, and the legend began to come apart, detail by detail. Raemond's ''Erreur Populaire'' went through successive editions, reaching a fifteenth as late as 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tinsley | first = Barbara Sher |date=Autumn 1987 | title = Pope Joan Polemic in Early Modern France: The Use and Disabuse of Myth | journal = Sixteenth Century Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–98 | issn = 0361-0160 | doi=10.2307/2540724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared the legend of the female pope to be untrue. The famous bust of her, inscribed ''Johannes VIII, Femina ex Anglia,'' which had been carved for the series of papal figures in the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo di Siena]] about 1400 and was noted by travelers, was either destroyed or recarved and relabeled, replaced by a male figure, that of [[Pope Zachary]].&lt;ref name="ShePope"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanford | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Stanford | title = The She-Pope: a quest for the truth behind the mystery of Pope Joan | year = 1999 | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0-7493-2067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Pope Joan was "effectively demolished" by [[David Blondel]], a mid-17th century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] historian, who suggested that Pope Joan's tale may have originated in a satire against [[Pope John XI]], who died in his early 20s.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt; Blondel, through detailed analysis of the claims and suggested timings, argued that no such events could have happened.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt;

The 16th-century Italian historian [[Onofrio Panvinio]], commenting on one of [[Bartolomeo Platina]]'s works that refer to Pope Joan, theorized that the story of Pope Joan may have originated from tales of [[Pope John XII]]; John reportedly had many mistresses, including one called Joan, who was very influential in Rome during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 4|last= McClintock |first= John |author2=James Strong |year= 1882 |publisher= Harper|location= |isbn= |page= 980|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lX4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA980&amp;lpg=PA980#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Biography: or, Third division of "The English encyclopedia"|last= Knight |first= Charles |year= 1867|publisher= Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co.|location= |isbn= |page= 633|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0MNPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT218&amp;lpg=RA1-PT218&amp;dq=pope+Joan&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Reformation]], various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers took up the Pope Joan legend in their anti-Catholic writings, and the Catholics responded with their own polemic.  According to [[Pierre Gustave Brunet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/lapapessejeanne01brungoog|title=La Papesse Jeanne: Étude Historique et Littéraire|author=Pierre Gustave Brunet|editor=Gay|editor2=Doucé|location=Brussels|year=1880|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Various authors, in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied themselves with Pope Joan, but it was from the point of view of the polemic engaged in between the partisans of Lutheran or Calvinist reform and the apologists of Catholicism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An English writer, Alexander Cooke, wrote a book entitled ''Pope Joane: A Dialogue between a Protestant and a Papist'', which purported to prove the existence of Pope Joan by reference to Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=Rustici&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuuJCOq0mSMC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England|last1=Rustici |first1=Craig M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=2006|page=43|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished in 1675 as ''A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called Joan, Was Really Pope of Rome, and Was There Deliver'd of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession''.&lt;ref name=Rustici/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A present for a papist: or, The history of the life of pope Joan|date=1740|publisher=Olive Payne|location=Cornhill, London|pages=1–88|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJgHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an account of Pope Joan giving birth to a son in plain view of all those around, accompanied by a detailed engraving showing a rather surprised looking baby peeking out from under the Pope's robes. Even in the 19th century, authors such as Ewaldus Kist and [[Karl Hase]] discussed the story as a real occurrence. However, other Protestant writers, such as [[David Blondel]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], rejected the story.

Most modern scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a medieval [[legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | title = The lady was a pope: A bestseller revives the outlandish tale of Joan | first = Lewis | last = Lord | date = 24 July 2000 | work = U.S. News Online | publisher = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5oQsXy9eD?url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | archivedate = 23 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-22 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Britain's preeminent historians dismisses the myth with a logical assessment of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius. Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy. 2011. ‘Pope Joan’ Chapter VI, pp. 63–70. {{ISBN|978-0-679-60499-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Dictionary of Popes''&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = J.N.D. | title = Oxford Dictionary of Popes | year = 2005 | origyear = 1988 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=0-19-861433-0 | pages=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that there is "no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign", but nonetheless acknowledges that Pope Joan's legend was widely believed for centuries, even by Catholics.

The 1910 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' elaborated on the historical timeline problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between Leo IV and Benedict III, where Martinus Polonus places her, she cannot be inserted, because Leo IV died 17 July 855, and immediately after his death Benedict III was elected by the clergy and people of Rome; but, owing to the setting up of an [[Antipope]], in the person of the deposed Cardinal Anastasius, he was not consecrated until 29 September. Coins exist which bear both the image of Benedict III and of Emperor [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who died 28 September 855; therefore Benedict must have been recognized as pope before the last-mentioned date. On 7 October 855, Benedict III issued a charter for the Abbey of Corvey. [[Hincmar]], Archbishop of Reims, informed Nicholas I that a messenger whom he had sent to Leo IV learned on his way of the death of this Pope, and therefore handed his petition to Benedict III, who decided it (Hincmar, ep. xl in P.L., CXXXVI, 85). All these witnesses prove the correctness of the dates given in the lives of Leo IV and Benedict III, and there was no [[interregnum]] between these two Popes, so that at this place there is no room for the alleged Popess.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08407a.htm | title = Popess Joan | first = J.P. | last = Kirsch | year = 1910| work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has also been noted that enemies of the papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female pope. For example, [[Photios I of Constantinople]], who became [[Patriarch]] in 858 and was deposed by [[Pope Nicholas I]] in 863, was an enemy of the pope. He vehemently asserted his own authority as patriarch over that of the pope in Rome, and would have made the most of any scandal of that time regarding the papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions "Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church".&lt;ref name="pardoe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pardoe | first = Rosemary and Darroll | title = The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend | url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoanHome.html | accessdate = 2010-03-22 |date=August 1988 | publisher = Crucible | isbn = 978-1-85274-013-9 | chapter=Chapter 3: 'Did Joan exist?' | chapterurl = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoan3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary and Darroll Pardoe, authors of ''The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan'', theorize that if a female pope did exist, a more plausible time frame is 1086 and 1108, when there were several antipopes; during this time the reign of the legitimate popes [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]], [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], and [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]] was not always established in [[Rome]], since the city was occupied by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and later sacked by the [[Normans]].&lt;ref name="pardoe"/&gt; This also agrees with the earliest known version of the legend, by [[Jean de Mailly]], as he places the story in the year 1099. De Mailly's "account" was acknowledged by his companion [[Stephen of Bourbon]].

[[Peter Stanford]], a British writer and former editor of ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', concluded in ''The Legend of Pope Joan: In Search of the Truth'' (2000) "Weighing all th[e] evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her that have been passed on down the centuries are true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of Pope Joan|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-3910-8|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanford's work has been criticised as "credulous" by one mainstream historian.&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Popes", by Vincent DeMarco, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages''] ed. Stephen Harris, Bryon L. Grigsby; [[Routledge]], 18 Feb 2008, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=peter%20stanford%20pope%20joan&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 68]&lt;/ref&gt;
Against the lack of historical evidence to her existence, the question remains as to why the Pope Joan story has been popular and widely believed. [[Philip Jenkins]] in ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]]'' suggests that the periodic revival of what he calls this "anti-papal legend" has more to do with [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] wishful thinking than historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Jenkins | title = The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 17 April 2003 | page = 89 | isbn = 0-19-515480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sede stercoraria'', the throne with a hole in the seat, now at [[St. John Lateran]] (the formal residence of the popes and center of Catholicism), is to be considered. This and other toilet-like chairs were used in the consecration of [[Pope Pascal II]] in 1099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one is still in the [[Vatican Museums]], another at the [[Musée du Louvre]]. The reason for the configuration of the chair is disputed. It has been speculated that they originally were Roman [[bidet]]s or imperial birthing stools, which because of their age and imperial links were used in ceremonies by Popes intent on highlighting their own imperial claims (as they did also with their [[Latin]] title, ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'').&lt;ref name="Norwich 2011 63"/&gt;

Alain Boureau quotes the humanist Jacopo d'Angelo de Scarparia, who visited Rome in 1406 for the enthronement of [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]]. The pope sat briefly on two "pierced chairs" at the Lateran: "... the vulgar tell the insane fable that he is touched to verify that he is indeed a man", a sign that this corollary of the Pope Joan legend was still current in the Roman street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval popes, from the 13th century onward, did indeed avoid the direct route between the Lateran and St Peter's, as Martin of Opava claimed. However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier. The origin of the practice is uncertain, but it is quite likely that it was maintained because of widespread belief in the Joan legend, and it was thought genuinely to date back to that period.

Although some medieval writers referred to the female pope as "John VIII", a genuine [[Pope John VIII]] reigned between 872 and 882. Due to the Dark Ages' lack of records, confusion often reigns in the evaluation of events.

A problem sometimes connected to the Pope Joan legend is the fact that there is no [[Pope John XX]] in any list. It is said this reflects a renumbering of the popes to exclude Joan from history. Historians have known since [[Louis Duchesne]]'s critical edition of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' that the "renumbering" was actually due to a misunderstanding in the textual transmission of the official papal lists. In the course of the 11th century, in the time after [[Pope John XIX|John XIX]], the entry for [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] had been misread as referring to two different popes of this name. These two popes then came to be distinguished as ''Iohannes XIV'' and ''Iohannes XIV bis'' ("John XIV the second").

The existence of a second Pope John XIV was widely accepted in the 13th century, hence the numbering of Popes John XV through XIX was regarded as being erroneous. When Petrus Hispanus was elected pope in 1276 and chose the papal name John, he decided to correct this error by skipping the number XX. He numbered himself [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], thus acknowledging the presumed existence of John XIV "bis" in the 10th century.

In 2018, an analysis of several silver coins from the 850s A.D, done by researchers from [[Flinders University]] indicated that they were inscribed with the name Johannes Anglicus. From the dating of the 850s, when there were missing papal records, led the researchers to believe the legend was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/female-pope-0010644|title= Researchers Find Physical Evidence for the Existence of a Female Pope|last= Whelan|first= Ed|date= 3 September 2018|website= www.ancient-origins.net|publisher= Ancient Origins|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.livescience.com/63598-female-pope-joan-medieval-coins.html|title= Legends of a Medieval Female Pope May Tell the Truth|last= Choi|first= Charles Q.|date= 16 September 2018|website= www.livescience.com|publisher= Purch|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Pope Joan has remained a popular subject for fictional works. Plays include [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]'s ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1813), a fragment by [[Bertolt Brecht]] (in ''Werke''. Bd. 10), and a [[monodrama]], ''Pausin Johanna'' by Cees van der Pluijm (1996).

The Greek author [[Emmanuel Rhoides]]' 1866 novel, ''The Papess Joanne'', was admired by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Alfred Jarry]] and freely translated by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as ''The Curious History of Pope Joan'' (1954). The American [[Donna Woolfolk Cross]]'s 1996 [[historical romance]], ''[[Pope Joan (novel)|Pope Joan]]'', was recently made into a German musical as well as the movie described below. Other novels include Wilhelm Smets's ''Das Mährchen von der Päpstin Johanna auf’s Neue erörtert'' (1829), [[Marjorie Bowen]]'s ''Black Magic'' (1909), Ludwig Gorm's ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1912),  Yves Bichet's ''La Papesse Jeanne'' (2005), and Hugo N. Gerstl's ''Scribe: The Story of the Only Female Pope'' (2005).

There have been two films based on the story of Pope Joan: ''[[Pope Joan (1972 film)|Pope Joan]]'' (1972), directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]], was titled ''The Devil's Imposter'' in the US. In 2009, it was recut to include more of [[John Briley]]'s original script and released as ''She... who would be Pope''. Also in 2009, another film with the title ''[[Pope Joan (2009 film)|Pope Joan]]'' was released, this one a German, British, Italian and Spanish production directed by [[Sönke Wortmann]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], based on Cross's novel.

The play ''[[Top Girls]]'' by [[Caryl Churchill]] featured Pope Joan as a character, who was invited to a restaurant along with other historically important women in the past by a modern-day woman, Marlene, to discuss the restriction of [[feminism]] in the past.

Pope Joan is referenced in the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'', as the inspiration for Johanna, one of the titular personas (cognitive beings used by humans to battle demons) belonging to Makoto Niijima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Persona® 5|url=http://atlus.com/persona5/characters-makoto.html|website=atlus.com|publisher=ATLUS|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rio Nuñez incident''' or '''Rio Nuñez affair''' was an [[international incident]] which occurred on the [[Nunez river|Rio Nuñez]] near [[Boké]], in modern-day [[Guinea]], in 1849. The incident occurred when vessels of a joint [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[French Second Empire|French]] naval force fired on two [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] traders in the area. 

During the 1840s and 50s, [[West Africa]] was the site of fledgling colonial rivalry between European powers. The Nuñez region lay between the [[French conquest of Senegal|French colony of Senegal]] and [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. French traders were increasingly challenged by commercial trading expeditions from Britain, Belgium and America.

The French regional commander, [[Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez|Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]], hoped that the Nuñez region could be formally annexed as a protectorate of the [[French colonial empire]]. The attack, far from securing the region for France, went contrary to Bouët-Willaumez's plans. Both France and Belgium led a [[cover-up]]. Attempts by the British Prime Minister, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]], to force France to pay reparations for the incident were ultimately unsuccessful and the affair lasted four years.

The incident formed part of the "Prelude to the [[Scramble for Africa]]" and, as Bouët-Willaumez had hoped, did lead to increased French control of the Nuñez. In 1866, French forces occupied Boké. The affair was therefore one of the first signs of future French hegemony in West Africa in what would become [[French West Africa]] (AOF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">'''Bruce Robert Isabell''' (June 2, 1952 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Event planning|event planner]] who was behind lavish and innovative events including weddings and funerals of the richest and most famous. He helped make Christmas at the [[White House]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] and helped create innovative events that made [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] into the place to be in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Isabell was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he worked in a flower shop as a youth. After graduating from high school he moved to [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/nyregion/11isabell.html "Robert Isabell, Who Turned Events Into Wondrous Occasions, Dies at 57"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 2009. Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1970s and was hired by [[Ian Schrager]] at [[Studio 54]], after Schrager had seen the creative designs Isabell had developed while he was working for event planner Renny Reynolds who had done work at the club and was the leading planner in his day. Schrager described how Isabell "never tried to do too much, it was never design on steroids, yet there was always the razzle-dazzle".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He started on his own operating a floral shop within [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. He established "a full-service event-production house" in the city's [[West Village]] where he would oversee the creation of events around the world, in which the entire setting including flowers, lighting, sound and table decorations would be part of his craft. [[Anna Wintour]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as "the king of the event world" who was "a magician"&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; and the first person that top hostesses would approach to create spectacular events. Isabell created roughly 30 events for writer and editor [[Tina Brown]]. She regarded him as "sort of a genius" who had the ability to "take any space and make magic in it".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For over a decade, he designed the annual [[Met Ball]] for ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=TCBG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/11894/|title=The Charity Ball Game|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2005-05-21|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, he had four tons of [[glitter]] dumped on the floor of [[Studio 54]] for a New Year's Eve event, with club co-owner Ian Schrager describing how guests felt "like you were standing on stardust".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Bracketed between the 1986 wedding of [[Edwin Schlossberg]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]] and the 1996 nuptials of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Carolyn Bessette]], he worked on the 1994 funeral of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For the July 1995 wedding of billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]]'s daughter [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] at [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in [[Bayswater]], [[London]], Isabell created a virtual Greek temple in a tent, including pillars topped with roses, with a budget variously estimated at $5–8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bob.

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

'''The Poppy Fields''' were a fictitious teenage group, invented by the [[Wales|Welsh]] rock band, [[The Alarm]]. The Poppy Fields scored a hit with the release of "[[45 RPM (song)|45 RPM]]" that would become The Alarm's first hit in over a decade. [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] revealed the truth on live radio as [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] was conducting a 2004 broadcast of their then current chart countdown. The story was highlighted by international news outlets with several headlines being published globally.

Immediately after exposing the hoax, the music video for "45 RPM" was replaced by an edited version that included The Alarm's members alongside the hyped members of The Poppy Fields.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt; Peters had enticed a young band called the Wayriders to lip-sync the song for the music video while posing as members of the nonexistent group.&lt;ref name="amusic" /&gt; The events surrounding this hoax have spawned the cinematic release of ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'', its soundtrack, The Alarm ''Vinyl Tour 2013'', and the subsequent announcement of a 2013 tour by The Alarm in support of the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt;

== Hoax ==

In an interview with [[BBC News]] Online, [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] said "[[The Alarm]], most famous for their 1983 hit '[[68 Guns]]', were not always taken seriously by DJs" because of a combination of the age of the band's members and a perception that their image was outdated. Peters said, "The Alarm as an entity have been going for 20-odd years and history can go against you &amp;ndash; we wanted to break the barrier down." He continued by saying that "[The Alarm members] wanted to stir up the water a little bit, break the mould" and have the song judged on its own merits and musical value, instead of judgement being based on the perception of the band.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; Peters told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "We noticed that a lot of bands suffer when they attempt comebacks because people generally don't believe they can ever be as good as they once were. We wanted to make sure we are judged purely on the strength of the music, and not by our old hairstyles."&lt;ref name="BBCNewsWales" /&gt;

=== The Poppy Fields ===

With The Alarm's decision to perpetrate the hoax, Mike Peters gained the cooperation of a group of young musicians from [[Chester]] called the Wayriders&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; to lip-sync The Alarm's material and pass it off as their own. The first release by the fictitious band was promoted as a cover of The Alarm's 1983 hit, "[[68 Guns]]".&lt;ref name="encofpm" /&gt; In fact it was The Alarm all along, and instead of a cover, it was a re-released version. The demo enticed executives in music production to record an album from the band called ''In The Poppy Fields'' which saw its advance release of the single, "45 RPM" entering Britain's top 30 chart. Critical reviews of the band echoed the promoters' official introduction of the band as a tribute to bands like [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]], with even more modern acts like [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] being compared.&lt;ref name="musicomh" /&gt; The truth of the song's origin was not revealed until after the song entered the charts at number 24,&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; a credit originally earned by The Poppy Fields from unsuspecting patrons who had accepted the act as fresh and new.&lt;ref name="11-30" /&gt;

== ''Vinyl'' ==

Filming for ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'' began in the [[Denbighshire]] resort town of [[Rhyl]] in August 2010.&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; ''Vinyl''{{'}}s soundtrack features new songs by [[The Alarm]] specifically composed for the film including the cinematic anthem, "Free Rock And Roll", recorded by The Alarm with ''Vinyl''{{'}}s leading actor, [[Phil Daniels]],&lt;ref name="BBCNews3" /&gt; in a song with The Alarm's lead vocalist and founding member, Mike Peters. The song was released as an EP single on 28 January 2013 in tandem with a national television campaign featuring both the film's cast and members of The Alarm.&lt;ref name="alarm" /&gt;

==Participants==
On the date of cancellation, two countries had finished selection of the participating couples for the contest:

*{{esc|Azerbaijan|Dance}} – host country
*{{esc|Belarus|Dance}} – winners of 3-month long preselection show ''Star Dances'' were [[Yulia Raskina]] and [[Denis Moryasin]]. Producer of the show confirmed that they would take part in Eurovision Dance Contest 2010 if it is organised.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;
*{{esc|Poland|Dance}} – [[Natasza Urbańska]] and Jan Kliment.
*{{esc|Portugal|Dance}} – internal selection was expected to take place with the couple being selected from the RTP series ''Dança Comigo''.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurofire.blog.de/2009/04/15/news-splitter-5950321/|title=News Splitter (208)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{esc|Russia|Dance}} – was set to be represented by professional couple [[Sergey Konovaltsev]] and [[Olga Konovaltseva]], named as participants of the show as early as in May 2008 and confirmed in 2009 edition of Russian version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

==Cancellation==
However, on 28 May 2009, [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) had announced that the contest was postponed at least until Autumn 2010 as "the number of broadcasters that signed up for participation had not reach the desired level". According to a preliminary calculations, at least five countries that were taking part in [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008]], namely {{esccnty|Austria|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Finland|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Lithuania|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Netherlands|Dance}} and {{esccnty|Sweden|Dance}} had announced withdrawal from the contest, with only {{esccnty|Belarus|Dance}} confirming its participation as a début country.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

According to contest coordinator on behalf of EBU Tal Barnea "concrete plans for a 2010 autumn event were being developed, with considerable changes to introduce a new programme proposal". These plans were expected to be unveiled in the autumn of 2009. EBU also praised "the commendable work on the next Eurovision Dance Contest already completed by our partners Ictimai Television and the Azerbaijani officials" stating that 2010 edition of the contest was planned to take place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] as well. 

In January 2010, EBU Eurovision coordinator, [[Svante Stockselius]], announced that contest has been postponed again, and is now unlikely to happen at all, at least within the next couple of years. He explained this decision was the fact that the popularity of televised dance shows had calmed down recently.&lt;ref name="date1"/&gt;

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.

'''Year zero''' does not exist in the [[anno Domini]] system usually used to number years in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and in its predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]. In this system, the year {{nowrap|[[1 BC]]}} is followed by {{nowrap|[[AD 1]]}}.  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year {{nowrap|1 BC}})  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year {{nowrap|1 BC}}) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.

== Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems ==

=== Historians ===

The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era was introduced in 525 by [[Scythia Minor|Scythian]] monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. He introduced the new era to avoid using the ''[[Diocletian Era|Diocletian era]]'', based on the accession of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]], as he did not wish to continue the memory of [[Diocletianic Persecution|a persecutor of Christians]]. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the "present year" was "the [[consulship]] of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]] [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]" which was also 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Dionysius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|title=DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS. LIBER DE PASCHATE SIVE CYCLUS PASCHALIS|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025617/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric [[Bede]] (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English [[Anno Domini|before Christ]] once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number [[Roman calendar#Months|days of the month]], weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the [[week#numerical|days of the week]] using a counting origin of one in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Previous Christian histories used ''[[anno mundi]]'' ("in the year of the world") beginning on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]], or ''anno Adami'' ("in the year of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]), used by Africanus, or ''anno Abrahami'' ("in the year of [[Abraham]]") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the [[Septuagint]], used by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], all of which assigned "one" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of ''Ecclesiastical history'', Bede stated that [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Britain "in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord", while stating in chapter III, "in the year of Rome 798, [[Claudius]]" also invaded Britain and "within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term "before Christ" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, ''not'' a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' ("before the time of the lord's incarnation"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of [[Roman numerals]]. The [[Babylonian numerals#Numerals|Babylonian system]] of the BC era had used the idea of "nothingness" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use [[Latin]] number words, or the word ''nulla'' (meaning "nothing") alongside Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=Dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans. ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time'' (725), Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004. {{ISBN|0-85323-693-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Byrhtferth's Enchiridion'' (1016). Edited by Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge. Early English Text Society 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-19-722416-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero ([[0 (number)|0]]) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The ''anno Domini'' nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the {{nowrap|1 January}} to {{nowrap|31 December}} historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Rolevinck, ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''anno Domini'', ''Dionysian era'', ''Christian era'', ''vulgar era'', and ''common era'' were used interchangeably between the [[Renaissance]] and the 19th century, at least in [[Latin]]. But ''vulgar era'' was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after ''vulgar'' acquired the meaning of "offensively coarse", replacing its original meaning of "common" or "ordinary". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|500 BC}} and {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|AD 500}}, there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage ''anno Domini'' 1 is preceded by the year 1 [[Ante Christum Natum|BC]], without an intervening year zero.&lt;ref&gt;While it is increasingly common to place ''AD'' after a date by analogy to the use of ''BC'', formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., {{nowrap|100 BC}}, but {{nowrap|AD 100}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the choice of calendar system (whether [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) nor the era (''Anno Domini'' or [[Common Era]]) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (1958), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomers ===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is &amp;minus;1, and so on.

The letters "AD", "BC", "CE, or "BCE" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to &amp;minus;1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Univ Science Books| isbn = 1-891389-85-8| editor1-first = Sean E. | editor1-last= Urban | editor2-first = P.

G. | author-last = Richards | page = 591 | location = Mill Valley, CA| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History of astronomical usage ====
In 1627, the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. He labeled the year ''Christi'' and inserted it between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (BC) and ''Post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae – Ioannes Keplerus] (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78).&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae – Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (AD).&lt;ref&gt;[Jacques] Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques'' (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISO 8601 ===

[[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an [[absolute value]] one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only [[ISO 646]] (7-bit [[ASCII]]) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a [[hyphen-minus]].

== Other traditions ==

=== South Asian calendars ===
All eras used with [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist calendar]]s, such as the [[Saka era]] or the [[Kali Yuga]], begin with the year 0. All  these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a [[24-hour clock]]: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, ''n'' minutes.

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
