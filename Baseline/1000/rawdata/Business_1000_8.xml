      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">An '''account manager''' is a person who works for a company and is responsible for the management of [[sales]] and [[Customer relationship management|relationships]] with particular [[customer]]s. An account manager maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The account manager does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the [[Customer|client]] of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one account manager throughout the duration of hiring the company. Account managers serve as the interface between the [[customer service]] and the [[sales]] team in a company.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The account manager serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Model_Job_Descriptions.html?id=z6R_uExfMGAC
 |title=Handbook of Model Job Descriptions |author =Barry.C|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key accounts''' provide the most business because they contain a small number of clients which contribute a large portion of the company's sales. According to research, sales from a company's key accounts have increased from 23% in 1975 to 60% currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815025753/http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-15 |title=The Evolution of Key Account Management |author=Phill J. |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of an account manager can vary depending on the industry they work in, size of the company and nature of the business. Each [[customer account]] can vary in demands and an account manager may work with [[brand manager]]s for one account and a media department for another. Account managers usually report directly to the account director or agency director of the activity and status of accounts and transactions. An account manager may also manage a single account or a variety of accounts depending on the requirement of the company. Although the responsibility can vary between companies and between accounts, there are a shared set of common responsibilities which are as follows:

# Generate sales for a portfolio of accounts and reach the company's [[sales target]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Identify new sales opportunities within existing accounts to retain a client-account manager relationship by [[up-selling]] and [[cross-selling]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Manage and solve conflicts with clients&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; The Account Manager is expected to have specific information regarding daily operations of the Company and keep the Client updated.
# Interact and coordinate with the sales team and other staff members in other departments working on the same account&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Establish budgets with the client and company&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Meet time deadlines for accounts&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are situations in which an account manager, for example in advertising firms, is responsible for more than one account and therefore looks after multiple clients. When account locations do not overlap the account manager can be placed at the divisional, district, or territory level. When a sales team has a senior sales manager, the account manager coordinates sales accounts from other departments or specialties.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYKyKAxpUvwC&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Sales management: a global perspective |author1=Earl D. Honeycutt |author2=John B. Ford |author3=Antonis C. Simintiras |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, the sales team will work under the direct supervision of influencers and deciders instead of with a [[buyer]].&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

* '''Global account managers:''' Manage company accounts worldwide. This typically occurs in large companies with international accounts.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;
* '''National account managers:''' Manage numerous accounts nationwide. This typically occurs in medium to large companies when a company has multiple locations across the country.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

Global account managers and national account managers may work together in a hierarchical or matrix structure. The trend is to move responsibility for the major key accounts to the global level.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

==Key account manager==
Key account manager is assigned to a company headquarters to oversee the account team assigned to a particular account.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; Key account management includes sales but also includes planning and managing the full relationship between a business and its most important customers. An account manager who works in this role will engage in a variety of tasks including [[project management]], coordination, [[strategic planning]], [[relationship management]], negotiation, leadership and innovative development of opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YutAr0bk2OUC&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Key Account Plans |author1=Lynette Ryals |author2=Malcolm McDonald |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and keeping record of transaction of sale and purchase goods. The tasks may include working with [[product design]] and application, [[logistics]], sales support, and [[marketing]].

==Key account management models==
The basic assumption for a key account management model is the correct classification of the key accounts. A basic model often used in the period of 1950-1970 was the classification model of Webster. This model has been adapted by Milman and Wilson into a two-dimensional model and was paramount in the period of 1970-1990. Bensaou has tested this model empirically by his research of [[carmaker]]s in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|United States]] and [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japan]] and made revisions. De Blick synthesized the adaptations into the 4S-model, a key account classification model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor=Sloan Management Review volume 4 issue 4|title=Portfolios of buyer-seller relationships|author =M.Bensaou, |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, key account management spread to most B2B ([[business-to-business]]) models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Account_Management.html?id=QEwXt2F3GssC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Global Account Management |author =Peter C.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work environment==
Account managers can work for small or large companies either corporate, financial, retail, or government for instance.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Any company with a specific clients they conduct business with, can employ an account manager. Typical employers can be: 
#Direct marketing consultancies and agencies
#Marketing departments 
#Major commercial organizations

Account managers usually work in an office setting and can work more than 40 hours weekly. Travel is usually included in the job description. National or global account managers will very likely experience extra travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://davidmaister.com/articles/key-account-management/
 |title=Key Account Management |author =David.M|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Although personality and an [[business acumen|aptitude for sales]] is key, a degree in business, marketing, or related field is typically required and depending on the nature of the account, a background in marketing or [[media studies]] may be preferred.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Due to each company having different requirements, it is important to obtain information from each potential company of employment.

'''BRFplus''' (Business Rule Framework plus) is a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS) offered by [[SAP AG]]. BRFplus is part of the [[SAP NetWeaver]] [[ABAP]] stack. Therefore, all SAP applications that are based on SAP NetWeaver can access BRFplus within the boundaries of an SAP system. However, it is also possible to generate [[web service]]s so that BRFplus rules can also be offered as a service in a [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] landscape, regardless of the software platform used by the service consumers.

BRFplus development started as a supporting tool that was part of [[SAP Business ByDesign]], an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] solution targeted at small and medium size companies. By that time, the tool was called “Formula and Derivation Tool” (FDT). Later on, it was decided to maintain BRFplus on those codelines that serve as the basis for [[SAP Business Suite]]. With that, [[business rule]]s that have been created for Business ByDesign can easily be taken over in a full-size SAP system where they are ready for use without any changes.

== Overview ==
BRFplus offers a unified modeling and runtime environment for business rules that addresses both technical users (programmers, system administrators) as well as business users who take care of operational business processes (like procurement, bidding, tax form validation, etc.). The different requirements and usage scenarios of the different target groups can be covered with the help of the SAP authorization system and a [[user interface]] that can be individually customized.

Being integrated into SAP NetWeaver, BRFplus-based applications can look at, and model, business rules from a strictly business-oriented perspective, rather than starting with the underlying technical artifacts. This is because the integration allows for direct access to the business objects available in the SAP dictionary (like customer , supplier, material, bill, etc.).

In addition to the predefined expression types (decision table, decision tree, formula, database access, loops, etc.) and actions (sending e-mails, triggering a workflow, etc.), BRFplus can be extended by custom expression types. Also, direct calls of function modules as well as ABAP OO class methods are supported so that the entire range of the ABAP programming language is available for solving business tasks.

BRFplus comes with an optional [[Software versioning|versioning mechanism]]. Versioning can be switched on and off for individual objects as well as for entire applications. Versioned business rules are needed in certain use cases for legal reasons, but they also allow for simulating the system behavior as it would have been at a particular point in time.

Once the rule objects are in a consistent state and active, the system automatically generates ABAP OO classes that encapsulate the functional scope of the underlying rule object. This is done on an on-demand base and speeds up processing.

The execution of functions as well as of single expressions can be [[Simulation|simulated]]. The processing log of the simulation is useful for checking the implementation and for investigating problems.

BRFplus applications can be exported and imported as an [[XML]] file. This is an easy way of creating a [[Backup|data backup]]. XML files can also be used for deploying rule applications throughout the company.

== Main Object Types ==

=== Application ===
The application object serves as a container for all the BRFplus objects that have been assembled to solve a particular business task.  It is possible to define certain default settings on application level that are inherited by all objects that are created in the scope of that application.

=== Function ===
A function is used to connect a business application with the rule processing framework of BRFplus. The calling business application passes input values to the function which are then processed by the expressions and rulesets that are associated with the called function. The calculated result is then returned to the calling business application.

=== Expression types and action types ===
* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]
* BRMS Connector
* [[Switch statement|Case]]
* Database Lookup
* [[Decision table|Decision Table]]
* [[Decision Tree]]
* [[Formula]]
* Function Call
* Loop
* Procedure Call
* [[Random number generation|Random Number]]
* Search Tree
* Step Sequence
* Value Range1
* [[XSL Transformation]]

=== Ruleset ===
A ruleset is a container for an arbitrary number of rule objects which in turn carry out the necessary calculations with the help of assigned expressions and actions. Instead of assigning an expression to a function, it is also possible to assign any number of rulesets to a function. When the function is called, all assigned rulesets are subsequently processed.

=== Data Objects ===
BRFplus supports elementary data objects (text, number, boolean, time point, amount, quantity) as well as structures and tables. Structures can be nested. For all types of data objects it is possible to reference data objects that reside in the data dictionary of the backend system. With that, a BRFplus data object does not only inherit the type definition of the referenced object but can also access associated data like domain value lists or object documentation.

=== Other objects ===
With catalogs, it is possible to define business-specific subsets of the rule objects that reside in the system. This is helpful for hiding the complexity of a rule system, thus improving usability.

Object filters are used by system administrators to ensure that for selected users, only a predefined subset of object types is visible. This is useful to enforce access rights as well as modeling policies.

== Other BRM solutions offered by SAP ==
BRFplus is positioned as the successor product of an older business rule solution known as BRF (Business Rule Framework). For a longer transition phase, both solutions exist in parallel. However, an increasing number of SAP applications that used to be based on BRF are constantly migrating to BRFplus.

While BRFplus supports business rules for applications based on the SAP NetWeaver ABAP stack, SAP is offering another product named SAP NetWeaver Business Rules Management (BRM). BRM supports business rule modeling for the SAP NetWeaver [[Java (software platform)|Java]] stack. Both products do not compete. They are available in parallel and can be used in a collaborative approach to deal with use cases where both technology stacks are used in parallel. BRFplus comes with a special expression type that helps bridging the gap between the two different technologies.

== Availability ==
BRFplus has been delivered to the public with SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 1 for the first time. Being part of SAP NetWeaver, the usage of BRFplus is covered by the "SAP NetWeaver Foundation for Third Party Applications" license, with no additional costs.

'''Bill of IT''' is an exhaustive list of IT [[asset]]s and services owned by a company. The bill displays a breakdown of all the IT assets and services in relation to various items.The bill is often used by companies as a [[IT chargeback and showback|chargeback and showback]] tool because it shows the relation between specific service/asset and employee, cost center, department, location, line of business, etc. It allows companies to see what they own and how their resources are allocated in the organizations. Most bills of IT show the following element (among other details):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/what-is-a-bill-of-it-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is a Bill of IT and Why is it Important?|last=Cheang|first=Henry|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cost - What each asset/service cost (price per unit)
* Price- The price of each service/asset multiply by the quantity of service/asset (predefined unit rate)
* Budget -The full budget (cost) associated with the use of this service/asset for a year or any chosen reporting period
* Quality -The quality of the service/asset is shown through various metrics: uptime, response time (with support), etc.
* Benchmarking - Comparison of this service/asset to the company’s benchmarks (use, efficiency, etc.)

Ultimately, the goal of a bill of IT is to clarify IT investments in an organization by presenting a detailed view of IT expenses.

The '''Board of Investment''' (BOI) is the national investment promotion agency of the Government of Mauritius with the mandate to promote and facilitate investment in the country. It is the first point of contact for investors exploring business opportunities in Mauritius and the region. BOI also assists investors in the growth, nurturing and diversification of their business.

With a view to facilitating the implementation of investment projects and, more importantly, to continuously improve the investment and business climate, BOI works in close collaboration with Government bodies, institutions and private sector companies.  [[Mauritius]] capitalized on the sale of strategic coastal land to foreigners through the Property Development Scheme programmes of the Board of Investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CCS_Research-Report_Chinese_Presence_South-Africa_Mauritius_Honita_Cowaloosur_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

BOI has an important role of policy advocacy to continuously improve the competitiveness of Mauritius.

'''Business communication''' is [[information sharing]] between people within and outside an organization that is performed for the commercial benefit of the organization. It can also be defined as relaying of information within a [[business]] by its people.

==Overview==

Business communication (or simply "communication," in a business context) encompasses topics such as [[marketing]], [[brand management]], [[customer relations]], [[consumer behavior]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[Organizational communication|corporate communication]], [[community]] engagement, [[reputation management]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[employee engagement]], and [[event management]]. It is closely related to the fields of [[professional communication]] and [[technical communication]].

Media channels for business communication include the [[Internet]], [[print media]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[ambient media]], and [[word of mouth]].

Business communication can also be said to be the way employees, management and administration communicate in order to reach to their organizational goals.

Business communication is a common topic included in the curricular of Undergraduate and Master's degree programs at many colleges and universities.

Methods of business communication include: 
*[[Web-based]] communication;
*[[Video conferencing]] – allows people in different locations to hold interactive meetings;
*[[Report]]s – important in documenting the activities of any department;
*[[Presentation]]s – popular method of communication in  all types of organizations, usually involving audiovisual material, like copies of reports, or material prepared in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] or [[Adobe Flash]];
*[[Telephone]] meetings – which allow for long distance [[speech]];
*Forum boards – which allow people to instantly post information at a centralized location;
*Face-to-face meetings – which are personal and should have a written followup;
*Suggestion box – primarily for [[upward communication]], because some people may hesitate to communicate with management directly, so they can give suggestions by drafting one and putting it in the suggestion box.

== Organizations ==
*Founded in 1936 by Shankar is the Association for Business Communication (ABC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141734/http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally called the Association of College Teachers of Business Writing, is "an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship,research ,education, and practice."
*The IEEE Professional Communication Society (PCS) [http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/] is dedicated to understanding and promoting effective communication in engineering, scientific, and other environments, including business environments. PCS's academic journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/?q=node/24 IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the premier journals in Europe communication. The journal’s readers are engineers, writers, information designers, managers, and others working as scholars, educators, and practitioners who share an interest in the effective communication of technical and business information.
*The [[Society for Technical Communication]] is a professional association dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of technical communication. With membership of more than 6,000 technical communicators, it's the largest organization of its type in North America.
*The [[International Business Communication Standards]] are practical proposals for the conceptual and visual design of comprehensible reports and presentations.

'''Business engineering''' ('''BE''') is the development and implementation of business solutions, from [[business model]] to [[business process]]es and [[organizational structure]] to [[information systems]] and [[information technology]] (cf.&lt;ref name="Oesterle_1995"&gt;[[Hubert Österle]]: ''Business Engineering: Prozess- und Systementwicklung.'' Band 1: Entwurfstechniken. Springer, Heidelberg 1994; 2., verbesserte Auflage 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Business engineering focuses on developing innovative business solutions that take a [[sociotechnical system]]s (STS) approach. The STS approach addresses an enterprise as a total system in the same manner as an airplane system or an industrial facility, since they possess a similar level of complexity.

Business engineering combines knowledge in the fields of business administration, Industrial Engineering, as well as information technology and connects it to all aspects of transformation, from means of presentation to [[process model]]s to cultural and political considerations (cf. Baumöl/Jung&lt;ref name="Baumöl_Jung"&gt;Ulrike Baumöl, Reinhard Jung: ''Rekursive Transformation: Entwicklung der Business Engineering-Landkarte.'' In: [[Walter Brenner (computer scientist)|Walter Brenner]], Thomas Hess (Hrsg.): ''Wirtschaftsinformatik in Wissenschaft und Praxis – Festschrift für Hubert Österle. Business Engineering.'' Springer, Berlin 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Overview  ==
Business engineering focuses on challenges arising from the transformation of the [[industrial society]] into an [[information society]] (cf. Winter&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"/&gt;), that is the digitization of enterprises, economy, administration and society. Through the ongoing consumerization digital services for individuals have also become a crucial part of research (cf. Hess/Legner&lt;ref name="Hess_Legner"&gt;Thomas Hess, Christine Legner, Werner Esswein, Wolfgang Maaß, Christian Matt, [[Hubert Österle]] et al.: ''Digital Life as a Topic of Business and Information Systems Engineering?'' Business and Information Systems Engineering (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of the major importance of information technology, business engineering is often held to be a subfield of Business Informatics, although it is also sometimes regarded as a form of Organization Development for its emphasis on Change Management.&lt;ref name="Sol_1995"&gt;Jeroen van Meel, [[Henk Sol]]: ''Business Engineering: Dynamic Modeling Instruments for a Dynamic World.'' Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 27 (4), 440-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineering Management]] is a very close discipline which overlaps significantly with Business Engineering; the main differences are that Industrial Engineering focuses primarily on the goods sector (less on services), on technical systems and the interface between those systems as well as the users from a production point of view.

[[Hubert Österle|Österle]]/Blessing&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Blessing_2005"&gt;[[Hubert Österle]], Dieter Blessing: ''[//www.alexandria.unisg.ch/export/DL/214185.pdf Ansätze des Business Engineering].'' In: HMD. 42, Nr. 241, 2005, S. 7-17.&lt;/ref&gt; characterize business engineering as follows:

* Beside the technical design, business engineering includes the political and cultural dimensions of a new business solution. The political and cultural dimensions and [[change management]] are crucial factors for the success or failure of a transformation (cf. Baumöl&lt;ref name="Baumöl_2010"&gt;Ulrike Baumöl: ''Cultural Change in Process Management.'' In: Jan vom Brocke, Michael Rosemann (Hrsg.): ''Handbook on Business Process Management 2.'' Springer, Berlin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;). Therefore, business engineering is an interdisciplinary approach. It divides the design levels of a company.
* Business engineering distinguishes between a strategic, an organizational and a technological design level. Contemplating different design objects on different levels enables a focused view of the individual dimensions of transformation (,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_etal_2007"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Hubert Österle]]|Surname2=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|Surname3=Frank Höning|Surname4=Stephan Kurpjuweit|Surname5=Philipp Osl|Periodical=Wisu - Das Wirtschaftsstudium|Title=Business Engineering: Core-Business-Metamodell |Volume=36|Issue=2|Year=2007|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;191-194|Date=  2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. 191). Segmenting task at hand into different levels provides for security and helps reducing the complexity of the transformation process.
* Business engineering ensures a holistic view of all dimensions. It supports not only the design of new business models, [[business process]]es and [[information system]]s, but also their implementation. Therefore, it contemplates all dimensions (resources and processes involved) of the transformation.
* Business engineering refers to the method and model-based design theory for companies in the information age (,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"/&gt; S. 7). Business transformations along with their technical and socio-economic aspects are far too important and complex to be realized without applying methods and models. Methods and models not only provide for transparency during the process of transformation, they also specify the division of labor, create a foundation for communication and enable the documentation of the company’s systematic reorientation. The division of labor and application of engineering principles differentiate the "construction" in accordance with business engineering from individualistic "creation" (cf.,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|EditorSurname1=[[Hubert Österle]]|EditorSurname2=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|Periodical=Business Engineering - Auf dem Weg zum Unternehmen des Informationszeitalters|Title=Modelle, Techniken und Werkzeuge im Business Engineering |Edition=2|Publisher=Springer|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=2003|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;87-118|Date=  2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. 88).
* Business engineering focuses on the consumer from a business perspective. As of now, this also holds true for the deep penetration of all spheres of private life with [[information technology]] (consumerization), which is equally being treated from a business and not an individual point of view.

At the Business Engineering Forum in St. Gallen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Business-Engineering-Forum |url=https://be-forum.iwi.unisg.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts from science and business annually discuss new developments within the discipline.

== Approaches ==

=== ARIS (Architecture of Integrated Information Systems) ===
The [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS concept]] (cf. Scheer&lt;ref name="Scheer_2001"&gt;[[August-Wilhelm Scheer]]: ''ARIS: Modellierungsmethoden, Metamodelle, Anwendungen.'' Springer, Berlin, 4.Auflage, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;) distinguishes between views and levels of description. The views are the organizational, data, performance, functional and control view of processes. For every description view there are three distinct levels of description. These are the technical concept, the data processing concept and the implementation level.
Through this framework, specific methods can be used to describe individual elements of the model. Those methods help depict and improve business processes, from fundamental business questions to the implementation on the IT level.

=== Business Engineering St. Gallen ===
The St. Gallen approach to Business Engineering comprises fundamentals and methods for different kinds of transformation projects. It distinguishes between the design level strategies, organization and information systems within the transformation process and, thus, reduces the complexity of the transformation.

* Strategy: Capabilities (incl. brand) and resources, business segments (products, services, customer segments), customer access, competitive position, ecosystem, and revenue and cost structures
* Organization: company organization structure and operational structure, focus on business processes with accompanying process performances, procedures, tasks and business objects
* Information system: System of applications and technical services, [[software]] and data components as well as [[IT infrastructure]] components. According to the relevance of IT in the respective organization, this level is further divided into the subcategories of "alignment", "software and data" and "IT infrastructure" (cf. Winter/Fischer&lt;ref name="Winter_Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]], Ronny Fischer|title=Essential Layers, Artifacts, and Dependencies of enterprise architecture|journal=Journal of Enterprise Architecture|volume= 3 |issue=2|pages=7–18|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The St. Gallen approach to Business Engineering has already been applied in more than 1.000 consultancy projects (S&amp;T 2008). Moreover, it receives support from renowned software tools such as the ARIS toolset (Scheer 2001, S. 18), ADOben (Aier et al. 2008) or Semtalk.

=== Semantic Object Model (SOM) ===
The [[:de: Semantisches Objektmodell|Semantic Object Model (SOM)]] (cf. Ferstl/Sinz&lt;ref name="Ferstl_Sinz"&gt;Otto K. Ferstl, Elmar J. Sinz: ''Der Ansatz des Semantischen Objektmodells (SOM) zur Modellierung von Geschäftsprozessen.'' In: Wirtschaftsinformatik, Vol. 37 (3), 209-220, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;) provides a framework for the conceptual modeling of system types. The modeling concept differentiates three levels of such systems: The strategic business plan; the operational business process models which focus on process types; and the specifications for implementing application systems. These levels can also be regarded as constituting perspectives on the system. They correspond to the external, internal, and resource perspectives. Subsequently, the levels of the model undergo a further conceptual division according to the organizational architecture, the process model, the principles of coordination or the object system.

=== The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) ===
[[The Open Group Architecture Framework|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]] (cf. Weinberger&lt;ref name="Weinberger_2010"&gt;Danny Weinberger: ''...und am Anfang steht die Geschäftsanforderung, oder?'' In: OBJEKTspektrum, Ausgabe EAM, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) presents a structure for organizational architectures which offers a holistic approach to designing, planning, implementing and maintaining information architectures and, thus, covers an important section, albeit not the entire scope, of BE. 
When applying TOGAF, the [[enterprise architecture]] is usually modeled in the three domains: [[business architecture]], [[information systems architecture]] (consisting of [[application architecture]] and [[data architecture]]), and [[technology architecture]].

=== Integral Design of Organizational Structures and Information Systems ===
Van Meel and [[Henk Sol|Sol]] (1996)&lt;ref name="Sol_1995"/&gt; define business engineering as an „integral design of organizational architectures and information systems". Dynamic modeling as well as simulation constitute the key components of their approach.

=== The3rdgear Business Engineering Model ===
With a specific focus on the demands of small business, The3rdgears' Business Engineering system has proven to be effective and relatively easy to implement for small to medium-sized businesses. Unique in that it involves the use of a specialised customisable software platform that integrates key business structures and operational performance processes. While The3rdgear system encapsulates the key areas of Strategy, Business Process, Technology and People, it has been proven to provide unusually consistent, predictable outcomes for small businesses due to the SME specific design of its improvement processes and software applications. This, combined with its ease of use for business owners and managers has made The3rdgear model popular within the SME marktet place.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Day_2011 - 'Management Trinity - How To Manage Any Business Without Having and MBA'&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business Engineering IBE Hong Kong ===
There has been another notion and approach put forth since 2005 by the Institute of Business Engineers (IBE)&lt;ref name="ibehk.org"&gt;http://www.ibehk.org/index.php/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iabep.org/about-us/corporate-members/&lt;/ref&gt; while sharing the common vision and advocacy of multi-disciplinary and holistic business view, and targeting the addressed issues in business practice and education.

The IBE put forth some principles and framework addressing the modeling of the business in a holistic, concise and structural manner. The model abstracts distinct, clearly defined key elements, processes, functions and relations from the complex, vague and loosely coupled business concepts. With the emphasis of holistic and integrative system view, it helps structurally and concisely capture a specific circumstance of business in four tiers, which are in turn composed of smaller constituents, for strategic planning and implementation:

* Finance: an internal tier that concisely reflects the enterprise’s financial status and performance, indicating the well-being of the enterprise by the financial data presented in balance sheet and income statement.
* Business functions: an internal tier that reflects an enterprise’s composition of the core business functions that collaboratively undertake all internal processes to achieve business goals with the constraints of their allocated cost.
* Market environment: an external tier that reflects the environment that affect the micro marketing circumstance that the business is facing. 
* Industry environment: an external tier that reflects the environment that affect the macro marketing or industrial circumstance that the business is facing.

Furthermore, to a certain extent, this model is claimed to provide a generic framework for filling the gap of other business engineering approaches in specifying business circumstances, serving as one of key pieces of puzzle in the full picture of business engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin Hui, Andrew Siu, Gary Ching: The Business “MINDFRAME”: SCPG Publishing Corporation: 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-938368-09-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin Hui, Andrew Siu, Gary Ching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16456">'''Business relations''' are connections between [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in the process of businesses, such as [[employer]]–[[employee]] relationships, managers as well as outsourced [[business partner]]s. The association of businesses began relationships which have been constructed through communication channels such as the likes of [[telephone]]s, personal contacts, and [[e-mail]]s. These types of contacts  are maintained and deepened through similar channels in internal businesses and organizations.

Within the business of this era, the aim of many businesses whether small or internationally established is to develop a target to [[motivation|motivate]] all types of employees to form a professional relationship with one-another which will have many benefits to the business which will strongly lead to success. Furthermore, external business relationships are essential to any organization as it will improve the companies image, develop [[brand loyalty]], and improve sales.

There are many different forms through which business relations are maintained. Primarily, these relations as stated previously, constructed through [[communication]] channels however face-to-face interactions and the [[social media]] are seen to be the most effective allowing people to form stronger ties. There have been many research studies suggesting that multiple modes of communication are important to build strong business relationships. Face-to-face interactions are typically the most effective due to the in-person communication aspect, as it allows people to form stronger ties. The more communication and interaction there is  between two entities, the stronger the business relationship builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smallbiztrends.com/2015/06/build-lasting-business-relationships.html|title=11 Ways to Build Solid, Lasting Business Relationships - Small Business Trends|website=smallbiztrends.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, internal business relations are important to maintain, as loyal employees can benefit the business by increasing profits. Moreover, loyal employees allow better relationships to be established with key suppliers and distributors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W.Y. Yee|first1=Rachel|last2=Yeung|first2=Andy C.L.|last3=Cheng|first3=T.C. Edwin|title=An empirical study of employee loyalty, service quality and firm performance in the service industry.|journal=international journal of Production economics|date=2010|volume=1|issue=124|pages=109–120|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the business will be able to retain its [[customer satisfaction]] which will influence the service quality. Commitments of employees is therefore highly recommended for further positive influence on the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The new age employee: An exploration of changing employee-organization relations.|last = Mir|first = Ali|date = 2002|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = 10.1177/009102600203100205|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Raza|first2 = Mir|issue = 2|pages = 187–200|last3 = Mosca|first3 = Joseph B.|volume = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Importance Of Loyalty and Trust in a Business ==

Business relations are important both externally and internally. Research has shown that "trust" is one of the most critical factors to develop and enhance effective long-term relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yimin|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Ian F.|title=The dynamics and evolution of trust in business relationships|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=April 2013|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether its with other business networks, individuals in a partnered firm or employees within the organization; who with a strong positive relationship can increase one or more of the following; long-term [[stock market]], [[employment rate]], [[productivity]], overall performance and other measures as  stated, with companies that are more aware and engaged with [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] matters, leading to a better performance level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karnes|first1=Roger Eugene|title=A Change in Business Ethics: The Impact on Employer–Employee Relations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=12 August 2008|volume=87|issue=2|pages=189–197|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9878-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, researchers of organizational behavior stress about organizational effectiveness being linked with employee's attribution. Therefore, creating an environment with employee satisfaction will hinder and solve such disagreements and arguments between one employee to another and the data will significantly preferable.

Moreover, as the business environment is constantly changing, it is causing firms to address new entrepreneurial innovative ideas that could out-stand them from the [[competition]]. Trust plays an important role in this as with developed business relations it allows one to react and initiate such innovative ideas to the business more effectively. There are two different types of trust that exists between business relations that affect one another, firstly " interpersonal" which refers to the individuals trust in one organization on other in the partnered organization. Secondly " inter organizational " which refers to members from the organization having a collective orientation or culture of trust towards a partner in a different organization.

With loyalty established internally in the organization and the employer aims and directs constant communication, the employer will form a strong relationship and bond between the employees and organizations; allowing them to feel more attached and sense commitment. This will result in a more motivated group of employees that will deliver high-quality services which is one of the key characteristics of  "[[social exchange]]". Delivering high quality services is essential as it allows organizations to gain customer satisfaction which gives a positive impact on the firm as customer satisfaction boosts [[customer loyalty]] and future behaviors. Customers become less concerned and sensitive towards prices as by being satisfied they tend to pay and tolerate such an increase in prices which in the long-term establishes a positive reputation as well as increasing the economic performance of the firm. Therefore, loyalty is essential in order to gain a strong employee relationship which can link to having a better customer loyalty, with time resulting in a more organized business that has a good flow of communication both internally and externally.

== Communication and Its Effect On Business Relations ==

Communication contact plays an important role in re-shaping the internal and external management in the organization. Communication cooperation internally can encourage " processes, strategies, activities, policies and programs" to be developed which enforce information and communication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisner|first1=Joel D.|last2=Stanley|first2=Linda L.|title=Internal Relationships and Activities Associated with High Levels of Purchasing Service Quality|journal=The Journal of Supply Chain Management|date=June 1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=25–32|doi=10.1111/j.1745-493X.1999.tb00059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have an effect on external relations which is considered to be rather important. Furthermore, establishing good communications at the beginning of the business between the employees, will provide the business with a positive reputation in the industry towards its rivalries and competitors in the market. Therefore, this could be constructed though the use of effective training programs and measurement systems.

Focusing on the internal aspect of communications, will allow external networks to trust the business by having the right perspective on the processes which may occur. This is due to the fact that communication is vital to sustain, especially when partnering with another company; whether its through [[mergers and acquisitions|merging]] or just joining a particular project. Therefore, the ability of associating with the right businesses is relevant in order to keep the company more innovative; as networks allow for " an effective transfer of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geigenmüller|first1=Anja|last2=Mitręga|first2=Maciej|title=Network partner knowledge and internal relationships influencing customer relationship quality and company performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=27 July 2012|volume=27|issue=6|pages=486–496|doi=10.1108/08858621211251488}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by gaining connections through networks; it can provide employee's, managers or owners to develop personal networks that can benefit oneself in the long term whether its towards a new entrepreneurial business plan, a project or even an incident that may occur within the business. An example is an entrepreneurial designer who used his personal connections in the industry to seek a potential supplier in China to continue developing his new business plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ian F.|last2=Young|first2=Louise C.|title=Innovation and Evolution of Business Relations and Networks: Theory and Method |arxiv=1203.1332|date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes on why obtaining and sustaining relations is beneficial for a business. Moreover, communication links with relationship marketing perfectly as both focus towards activities directed as establishing, developing and maintaining successful exchanges with customers and other constituents. (Morgan and Hunt 1994).

On the other hand, even though communication is a key concept to any business. Organizations should not fully depend on establishing only a few relations and shutting down others that may be beneficial, due to the fact that networking and developing relationships should not have limits. Engaging with new businesses frequently can provide positive change within the business by introducing new concepts and innovative ideas that keep up with the changes that take place in the industry regularly. Thus, businesses should accept some new organizations as well as keep close to old ones in order to sustain its position in the industry and adapt to the changes that take place.

To further extend, there are multiple ways of communicating within a business to improve relations whether its through technology, discussions in the office or through annual reports. More specifically, organizations are recommending the use of technological devices such a videoconferencing and teleconferencing which allows individuals to not be present at the same place but still be able to interact with one another, similarly the use of laptops and such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Dave|last2=Raffo|first2=Carlo|last3=Anderton|first3=Alain|title=Business studies.|date=2008|publisher=Causeway|location=Ormskirk|isbn=9781405892315|pages=446–455|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners and managers consequently highlight the importance of communication in the business, especially in large organizations as there are longer layers in the [[hierarchy]] as well as more commitment.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The effect of Social Media on business relationships'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

Nowadays, Social Media plays an important role in establishing relationships. It is reported that there  is 1.5 billion social media users globally, with at least 70% of companies using some form of social media ([[McKinsey Global Institute]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The social economy: Unlocking value and productivity through social technologies|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many connections can be constructed through organizations  such as “ [[LinkedIn]]” where one can form new relations that can be beneficial in the longterm and contacts are usually made between individuals from different businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The art of business relationships through social media {{!}} Ivey Business Journal|url = http://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-art-of-business-relationships-through-social-media/|website = iveybusinessjournal.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Millennials|millennial generation]] more specifically are actively involved with social media on a daily basis and with the continuous change that is occurring in the industry, social media is essential for improving business performance and helping firms achieve a [[competitive advantage]]. In addition, (Cross and Katzenbach 2012 ) found that 90% of the information used for decision making came from informal networks rather than formal reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Rob|last2=Katzenbach|first2=Jon|title=The Right Role for Top Teams|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00103?gko=97c39|website=www.strategy-business.com/|publisher=Strategy and Leadership|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with Different Business Sizes ==

Business relations within a small organization differs from the regular as it is a mix of both formal and informal management. However, this depends on the internal management and more specifically the owners/managers own personal preferences. Even though this style of management is seen to be less flexible, it is more beneficial towards expanding in size and profitability. Many believe that with owners/managers, having both a formal and informal approach operations will occur more efficiently; resulting with a better positive outcome causing growth, an increase in profitability and a positive reputation between other competitors in the market, which is what every small business intends to achieve. In addition, small business control more than half of the market but many are seen to fail due to poor planning and inefficient external business relations.

Small businesses external relations are essential for success, an external relationship is defined as " a commercially oriented connected between a small business and other two organizations". The most known types are alliances and networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Street|first1=Christopher T.|last2=Cameron|first2=Ann-Frances|title=External Relationships and the Small Business: A Review of Small Business Alliance and Network Research*|journal=Journal of Small Business Management|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=2|pages=239–266|doi=10.1111/j.1540-627X.2007.00211.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a relationship based on mutual interests and benefits as well as forming relationships within different organizations together into one. An example of forming an external relationship based on networking is engaging with a foreign organization, to increase financial gain and [[market share]] within the industry.This emphasizes the importance of forming external relationships, as this can push the business into having a more effective; higher position in the market, ahead of its competitors with greater brand awareness and recognition. Small businesses have a difficult time building good business relations as business relations is connected with such marketing performances and the need of having a good starting profit, time, planning and marketing expertise, therefore establishing strong external social ties from different organizations can strengthen the overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamprinopoulou|first1=Chrysoula|last2=Tregear|first2=Angela|title=Inter‐firm relations in SME clusters and the link to marketing performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=2 August 2011|volume=26|issue=6|pages=421–429|doi=10.1108/08858621111156412}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business war gaming''' (Corporate war gaming) or business wargaming is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting. Unlike [[Military simulation|military war games]], or [[Wargaming|fantasy war games]] which can be set hundreds of years in the past,  business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development, but they are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9257879 "Shall We Play a Game?"] ''[[The Economist]]'', June 2, 2007, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for running a business [[wargaming|war game]] is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change, as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change, and to each other. The benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable, and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from Richard Clark, CEO of [[Merck and Co.]], who in an interview to [[USA Today]] said: "''I am a strong believer in if you’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that…it can’t be just the CEO or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2006-02-26-merck-cover-usat_x.htm USA Today, "Merck CEO sets sight on change", February 27, 2006, p. B1]&lt;/ref&gt;".

At the Paul Merage School Of Business at [[University of California, Irvine]] the final exam for the [[competitive intelligence]] class is a war game in which the students role play various companies to try to win in the marketplace. Each year student teams have developed strategies - some of which have actually happened in the market place indicating that a war game is a very powerful predictive tool for businesss when planned properly.

== Methodologies ==

=== Market level ===
Currently there are three schools of thought about business [[wargaming|war game]], depending on the underlying philosophy of their creators: "Business is War" war games, "Business is a Game" war games, and "Business is Business" war games. The three types have accordingly, different strengths and weaknesses, and are useful for different applications throughout business.

==== "Business is War" ====
Sometimes abbreviated as 'BIW' war games, 'Business is War' games are a direct adaptation from the military [[wargaming|war games]], and envision competitors as the "enemy" and the goal as "victory" in a market "battle". These games are based on mathematical modeling of contestable markets, including [[chaos theory]], random variable generation ([[Monte Carlo simulations]]), and [[econometric model]]ing of demand and supply conditions. Participants’ generated moves are fed into computer program which generates optimal solutions in the mathematical space. Not surprisingly these games come with a high price tag, and are advocated by large consulting firms which tend to work with the US military establishment.

==== "Business is a Game" ====
'BIG' war games regard business transactions as a game between participants with potentially conflicting goals. BIG advocates apply [[game theory]], a branch of mathematics to business situations with the goal of finding an equilibrium, or "stable" solution (so called [[Nash equilibrium]]) whereby no one can further improve on the outcome. The solution can be computed over a large space of all possible (hypothetical) moves of the players. A leading proponent of this type of war games is Niall Fraser, a game theorist and the founder of a consultancy called [[Open Options]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, N.M. and K.W. Hipel (1984). Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions. New York: North-Holland&lt;/ref&gt; A variant on BIG is computer simulations’ games using simultaneous equations to solve for demand and supply equilibrium (not a game theory solution). Participants input numerical values for decisions on a wide range of business investments (in production, sales force, advertising, etc.), and receive a computer output of the equilibrium results.

==== "Business is Business"  ====
Also referred to as 'BIB' regard business as neither a war nor a game.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben. "Neither a War Nor a Game", CI Magazine, 9(6), Nov.-Dec. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The goals and tactics of war are incompatible with business goals; competitors do not aim to defeat each other but to satisfy customers’ preferences better than others. Government precludes total victories and cooperation is as prevalent as competition. Similarly, BIB criticizes "Business is Game" thinking on the ground that hypothetical or generic moves are irrelevant or trivial, stable solutions are not a substitute for specific, real life practical and innovative strategies for management, and computer/mathematical simulations do not approach the complexity of competitive dynamics in real markets. Instead, BIB advocates using state-of-the-art [[competitor analysis]] techniques and real life [[competitive intelligence]] to generate an in-depth profiling of competitors through role playing. The goal of BIB is predicting most likely moves by most significant competitors or other third parties (customers, regulators) so that strategy can be pressure–tested in the most realistic setting. The creator of BIB games is [[Benjamin Gilad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben (2008). Business War Games. NJ: [[Career Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; A variation combines BIB war gaming with computer simulations. This approach, used by Mark Chussil, founder of Advanced Competitive Strategies, uses simulations to estimate the likely outcomes from moves made by a business, its competitors, and other relevant actors, across multiple scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ACS-Business-War-Gaming-Bibliography-1-12.pdf|title=ACS Business War Gaming Bibliography|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allows for both competitive dynamics and quantitative analysis, at the cost of additional time to set up the war game.

=== Negotiation level ===
In contrast to the often larger “Business is War”, “Business is a Game” and “Business is Business” war games, which all primarily deal with market level issues, Negotiation War Games are smaller in scope and only deal with business related negotiations. Even though the US military have long referred to the practice of ”War Gaming a negotiation”, the term ”Negotiation War Game” was first coined by Soren Malmborg in 2010.

==== Negotiation War Games (aka. NWG) ====

A "NWG" is a Business War Game conducted at negotiation level. I.e. A structured framework for conducting a preparatory Negotiation Simulation&lt;ref&gt;Shell, G. Richard (2006). "Bargaining for Advantage". Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; on a specific, upcoming negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Henry S. (2001). “Game, set, match: winning the negotiations game”. ALM Publishing/ALM Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt;

A Negotiation War Game is most often divided into three steps:
1/ Gather Intelligence
2/ Simulate Upcoming Negotiation
3/ Debrief and calibrate negotiation strategy.

By adding Competitive Intelligence to the simulation, Negotiation War Gaming differentiates itself from normal mock negotiations and other training exercises. The act of gathering and including Competitive Intelligence on the forthcoming negotiation and its parties, lets participants in the Negotiation War Game gain an in-depth understanding of the negotiation itself and the negotiation parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Playing_war_games_to_win_2757&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of doing a Negotiation War Game is threefold; 
1/ Predicting your opponents' next move 
2/ Revealing opportunities, threats and issues 
3/ Developing and testing a calibrated negotiation strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghauri, Pervez N., Jean-Claude Usunier (2003). “International business negotiations”. Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==== Role-Play ====

Even though software applications can play an important role in the facilitation of a Role-Play Negotiation War Game, the method is inherently focused on role-play simulation. War Games can be used to prepare for virtually all two or three party negotiations. By gathering Competitive Intelligence on the actual negotiation (as well as the individuals involved) an accurate simulation can be created. A client’s employees will then become involved in the actual War Game by acting partly as the company itself, partly as the other negotiating party. Through a series of structured simulations, a tailor-made strategy can then be developed and calibrated.

Role-Play Negotiation War Games are especially effective when preparing for Sales- and Procurement negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holdenadvisors.com/news/1112.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through more than 30 years of business usage and scientific research, the method has been shown to generate significantly better negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods. (Please see Application section below for references).In 2010, 64,7% of young US Sales-Managers Role-Played their upcoming negotiations, making "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Gaming one of the most used negotiation preparation techniques in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmaglobal.org/MMJ-Archive/Spring2010/47035-1MMA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
A leading proponent and provider of these types of War Games is Outcome Simulations ApS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outcomesimulations.com&lt;/ref&gt; led by Soren Malmborg.&lt;ref&gt;"Krigsspil kan hjælpe erhvervschefer". Dagbladet Børsen 26.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Outcome's Negotiation War Gaming method is taught in MBA courses on negotiation at [[Columbia Business School]] and [[NYU Stern School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.business.dk/?article=25236318-Ivaerksaetter-vil-saelge-%C2%BBkrigsspil%C2%AB-til-amerikanerne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/46460/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== BIW ===
Given the high budget requirements and long preparations time, BIW games are more appropriate for big companies' big decisions and large budgets, such as corporate games, involving top executives with considerable staff and consultant support. Corporate games are played over major portfolio decisions such as diversification and/or divestiture moves of the parent company (i.e., which acquisitions to go for, which business to get rid of), and over longer term horizons. BIW games are less appropriate for business units,  or ''business'' strategy decisions, as their high price tag and extensive time required from top executives are no match for small scale games with more tailored application and flexible format.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, David. "War Games Help Businesses Prepare For Anything". Wall Street Journal (Eastern edition), Newswire: Dow Jones,5/3/02&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the difference between corporate games played over corporate strategy (portfolio management) and business games played over business strategy (competitive strategy), read Michael Porter’s articles.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E. ["From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy". ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', May–June, 1987 pp. 43-59 and "What is Strategy", ''Harvard Business Review'', Nov-Dec. 1996, pp. 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BIG ===
Game theory and computer simulation games are appropriate for planning and decision support in industries in relatively stable state, known distributions of outcomes, and predictable competitors, as they are best suited for finding equilibrium solutions among a relatively large set of known variables (payoffs and moves). On the other hand, BIG games are handicapped in rapidly changing industries, markets where surprise moves by new players is a possibility, situations requiring innovative and creative approaches, and in decisions calling for specific practical ideas rather than more generic moves (such as raise, stay or lower prices by x%). Decision makers looking at war gaming should also be minded of game theory’s own lack of empirical support, as people seem to irrationally follow behaviors that do not result in their best outcome.

=== BIB ===
Business war games employing role-playing and competitor analytical techniques are most beneficial in business strategy at the business unit, market, brands, product and project levels. BIB games have been applied with great success to new product launches, offensive and defensive moves against specific competitors (whose response is analyzed using the advanced competitor analysis techniques), in organizational development’s (training the next generation executive cadre) "competitive landscape" games, and in brand revival and new market entry situations. According to participants, BIB games provide touch reality-based challenge to strategies and plans that helps companies cope with uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; They are less useful in conglomerate strategy as they apply to business strategy and not across unrelated industries. BIB are also more culture sensitive, and should be applied with caution in cultures where honest discussion of blindspots is less than appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The methodological superiority of BIB games over other techniques received strong empirical support from a meta study on the effectivenes of predictions of competitive outcomes using "role playing".&lt;ref&gt;Kesten C. Green, “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts: Further evidence”, International Journal of Forecasting 21 (2005) 463– 472&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWG (Pure Role-Play) ===
"Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have shown to generate significantly better predictions of negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods.&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. C. (2005), “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts,” International Journal of Forecasting, 21, 463-472&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have also been shown to ensure significantly lower prices in procurement negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Robert J. (1991),“Simulated Negotiations: A Measure of their Effectiveness on Negotiated Outcome”. Naval Postgraduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and greater writedowns in auditor vs. client negotiations concerning obsolete inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Trotman, Ken T. (2005),“Auditor negotiations: An examination of the efficacy of intervention methods”.The Accounting Review, Vol. 80, No. 1. pp. 349-367&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games have been used extensively in business negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games are furthermore often used in politics. Negotiation War Gaming was used to prepare President Ronald Reagan for his negotiations with Gorbachev in Reykevik and Geneva in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Matlock, J.F. Jr. (2004). Reagan and Gorbachev: How the cold war ended. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential candidate John Kerry used a Negotiation War Game to prepare for his first TV-duel with George W. Bush in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Wilgoren, J. &amp; Stevenson, R.W.  (2004). The 2004 campaign: Strategy; day after debate, campaigns assess the performances. The New York Times, October 2, Later edition – final, Section A, p. 10 column 1&lt;/ref&gt; Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney used the method prior to the 2012 presidential TV-duels. The NTC (National Training Center, Fort Irwin. Ca.) recommend that all U.S. and Canadian Army officers be trained in the method before deployment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/PUB792.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board Games ===
Board games can be used for business war games. In this case, they are [[wargaming|war games]] for civilians applied with a [[marketing warfare]] analogy to a market situation.&lt;ref&gt;Goria, S. [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00584200/fr/ Information display from board wargame for marketing strategy identification], International Competitive Intelligence Conference: Delivering excellence in Competitive Intelligence thinking and practice in a challenging environment, Bad Nauheim, Germany, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, these authors talk about [[creative competitive intelligence]].

== The war metaphor ==
To some, the war metaphor implicit in "business war game" is an accurate or useful depiction of business and competitive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/55076/business-war|title=Business As War|last=Fuller|first=Mark B.|date=October 31, 1993|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-2015-2|title='Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary explains why business is war|last=Feloni|first=Richard|date=February 5, 2015|website=Business Insider|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find the war metaphor potentially counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/2010/08/18/the-war-game-metaphor/|title=The War (Game) Metaphor|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=August 18, 2010|website=|publisher=Advanced Competitive Strategies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/debunking-the-myth-that-business-is-war/|title=Debunking the Myth that Business is 'War'|last=Heffernan|first=Margaret|date=January 24, 2011|website=|publisher=CBS Moneywatch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies play up the war metaphor simply to encourage out-of-the-box thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/27580/business-war-so-lets-have-war-game|title=Business is War - So Let's Have a War Game|last=Diamond|first=David|date=December 31, 1996|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others downplay it with terms such as "strategy game."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8553">The '''chief privacy officer''' (CPO) is a senior level executive within a United States-based business or organization. "Consumer concerns over the use of personal information, including medical data and financial information along with laws and regulations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} DefineFinance|url = http://www.definefinance.com/chief-privacy-officer|website = www.definefinance.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the key reasons that the CPO role exists, as this was introduced to help keep personal information safe.

There is legislation in different sectors concerning the use of personal information. For example, in medical industry, the protection of patient medical records (e.g. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or [[HIPAA]]). Another example is in the finance sector with the safeguarding of consumer financial and banking transactions (e.g. The [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] and its Disposal Rule, and the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and its Safeguards Rule and Financial Privacy Rule).

== History ==
In the United States, the position of chief information officer was first established at Acxiom Corporation in 1991 with the appointment of Jennifer Barrett as CPO,&lt;ref&gt;https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlPjEAAV/&lt;/ref&gt; with the second appointment of CPO at the Internet advertising firm [[AllAdvantage]] in August 1999, when it appointed privacy lawyer [[Ray Everett-Church]] to the newly created position, starting a trend that quickly spread among major corporations, both offline and online. The role of the Chief Privacy Officer was solidified within the U.S. corporate world in November 2000 with the naming of Harriet Pearson as Chief Privacy Officer for [[IBM|IBM Corporation]]. That event prompted one influential analyst to declare, "the chief privacy officer is a trend whose time has come." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/IBM+appoints+chief+privacy+officer/2100-1001_3-249135.html news.com IBM appoints chief privacy officer]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, the non-profit research organization Privacy and American Business reported that a significant number of [[Fortune 500]] firms had appointed senior executives with the title or role of Chief Privacy Officer. The growth of the Chief Privacy Officer trend was further fueled by the European Union's passage in the late 1990s of [[information privacy|data privacy]] laws and regulations that included a requirement for all corporations to have an individual designated to be accountable for privacy compliance.

By 2002, the position of Chief Privacy Officer and similar privacy-related management positions were sufficiently widespread to support the creation of professional societies and trade associations to promote training and certification programs. In 2002 the largest of these organizations, the Privacy Officers Association and the Association of Corporate Privacy Officers, merged to form the International Association of Privacy Officers, which was later renamed the [[International Association of Privacy Professionals]] (IAPP). The IAPP holds several conferences and training seminars each year around the world, hosting association members from major global corporations and government agencies, with executives seeking certification programs in privacy management practices.

== Responsibilities &amp; Duties ==

Some of the key responsibilities that a CPO has to have are: being able to use business strategies and procedures and apply it to the business, being able to organize plans and lastly looking at privacy program reviews by checking and analyzing the information to ensure it is correct. They are also responsible for making sure data is secure from unauthorized users and making. They would also have to help to improve systems for auditing and monitoring, to therefore resolve any privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Current Openings|url = http://www.merkleinc.com/careers/current-openings?gnk=job&amp;gni=8a7880ec5088917c015090c5ff850d3a&amp;gns=Indeed&amp;source=indeed.com#.Vjj9xWvS7Tg|website = Merkle|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a CPO is responsible for all the privacy of the data in an organization, one major part of their job is to avoid [[Data breach|data breaches]], especially if the organization is a large corporation. However some major companies have been hacked and have data breaches.

These include:
*[[eBay]] -  up to 145 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful"&gt;{{Cite web|title = World’s Biggest Data Breaches &amp; Hacks {{!}} Information is Beautiful|url = http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/|website = www.informationisbeautiful.net|accessdate = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Target Corporation|Target]] -  up to 70 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Home Depot]] - up to 56 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] - up to 80 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Chase]] - up to 76 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;

Data breaches are commonly high-profile events and not only the reputation of the CPO will be affected but also the company's reputation, impacting consumer confidence.

== Qualities  ==
One key quality a CPO will need to have is being good at communicating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 7 habits of highly effective CPOs - Supply Business|url = http://www.supplybusiness.com/previous-articles/winter-2009-2010/features/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-cpos/|website = www.supplybusiness.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; because poor communication could lead to a leakage of data which the CPO would be accountable for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Government Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} ICT.govt.nz|url = https://www.ict.govt.nz/governance-and-leadership/the-gcio-team/government-chief-privacy-officer/|website = www.ict.govt.nz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another quality a CPO should have is staying aware of any new developments and risks in the field.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
There are some major benefits to having a CPO in your organization. The first would be that they help to keep data secure, so this ensures that security of data is not compromised.  Another benefit is that they help develop policies which is why "''30% of CPOs are attorneys''" and "''15% are in the information security department''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why your company needs a chief privacy officer|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2290212/lan-wan/why-your-company-needs-a-chief-privacy-officer.html|website = Network World|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this means that CPO can legally help to ensure that the data stays secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer|url = https://hbr.org/2000/11/chief-privacy-officer|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of what industries a CPO can be beneficial, a CPO would be favorable in almost every sector. For example, the finance sector is perhaps one of the main areas where you are dealing with consumer information. It's not just the finance sector, basically anywhere you have and store customers information, a CPO would be a good idea as they will help to ensure that customers data is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Does Your Company Need A Chief Privacy Officer?|url = http://www.informationintersection.com/2012/10/does-your-company-need-a-chief-privacy-officer/|website = Information Intersection|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some drawbacks to having a CPO in your organization, the first being cost. According to [[payscale.com]] the average salary for a CPO in the United States is over 6 figures, roughly about $107,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy &amp; Security Officer Salary|url = http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Chief_Privacy_%2526_Security_Officer/Salary|website = www.payscale.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback to having a CPO in your business would be that some may argue that it's just too much power for one person to have, especially if they are dealing with personal information{{who|date=November 2015}}.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015).

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''. Center for Effective Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Willingness to take risks
# Eager listeners
# Passion for the cause
# Optimistic about the future
# Able to share knowledge, power and credit

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017). Collaborative leadership and the implementation of community-based fall prevention initiatives: a multiple case study of public health practice within community groups. ''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concern''' ({{lang-de|Konzern}}) is a type of [[Corporate group|business group]] common in Europe, particularly in [[Germany]]. It results from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management.

A concern consists of a controlling enterprise and one or more controlled enterprises.&lt;ref name="s17"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 17&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the controlling and controlled enterprises is based on the actual commercial and management relationships, unlike [[parent company|parent]] and [[subsidiary]] companies which are related by share ownership and voting rights.&lt;ref name="s16"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of professionals, the term ''Group'', also mistakenly ''within the meaning of large companies'' – regardless of its corporate structure – is understood.

The Group concept is one of [[European Union competition law|anti-trust]] relevance: the so-called Group privilege, the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of the consolidated Group companies involved, means that in itself, [[prohibition]] included practices did not violate [[Law of Germany|German]] or [[European Commission]] (EC) anti-trust law. On the other hand, the Group concept in [[Banking Act]] in the formation of [[borrower unit]] and particularly of the [[trade credit|large credit]] limits of paramount importance.

==Types of Concern==
The 1965 ''Aktiengesetz'', literally "stock law", but commonly known in English as the German Stock Corporation Act, defines a concern as: "one dominant and one or more dependent companies, together under the unified leadership of the ruling company".&lt;ref name="s18"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aktiengesetz'' applies only to any ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]en'' (AG; literally "stock company"; singular ''Aktiengesellschaft''), which are analogous to [[public company|public companies]] in the English-speaking world. An ''Aktiengesellschaft'' differs from a ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH), which is analogous to [[limited liability]] companies in other countries. A GmbH is regulated under the ''Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung'' of 1892 (GmbH-Gesetz; literally "law concerning companies with limited liability").

Three different kinds of concern are identified under ''Aktiengesetz'': the contractual concern, the factual concern, and the flat concern.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reich-Graefe|first1=Rene|title=Changing Paradigms: The Liability of Corporate Groups in Germany|journal=Connecticut Law Review|date=2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contractual Concern===
In this form of concern, the controlling enterprise and controlled enterprise enter into a control agreement – wherein the controlling enterprise can obtain management powers over the controlled enterprise, sometimes amounting to complete control – and/or a profit transfer agreement.&lt;ref name="s291"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 291&lt;/ref&gt; These powers may be used in a way that is detrimental to the subsidiary, provided that they are in the interests of the concern and do not damage the legal separateness of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

In return, the controlling enterprise is liable to compensate the controlled enterprise for all deficits of the controlled enterprise during the term of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

===Factual Concern===
In this form of concern, the controlling enterprise exerts a controlling influence on the controlled enterprise, but there is no formal control or profit transfer agreement.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; If one company owns a majority in another company, then the first company is deemed to exert a controlling influence.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; The parent company is then liable for any damage which results from the interference of the parent company in the subsidiary, which is judged on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt; This kind of concern is more difficult to establish and so is more common.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

===Flat Concern===
In this version, there is no parent company, instead a number of legally separate companies are subject to common direction.&lt;ref name="s18" /&gt;

==Other forms of Concern==
To apply the law of concern to concerns involving German limited liability companies, the German courts have created the qualified de facto concern, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt; This form of concern applies only in parent subsidiary relationships. If the parent is shown to have a long-standing and pervasive control over the affairs of the subsidiary, then there is a presumption that the parent was not acting in the best interests of the subsidiary. If the parent is unable to displace this presumption, then the parent is liable for all the obligations of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

This type of concern was limited by the German Federal Supreme Court in 2002 to only apply where the control is such that the subsidiary will inevitably collapse or become insolvent, on the basis that the parent has abused the separate legal personality of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

==Conglomerate==
''(inorganic groups)''
The '''[[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]''' consists of enterprises in different businesses. Unlike the concern, the companies in a conglomerate have limited business relationships with each other.

==Criticism of corporations==
The result of the merger often emerging political power of (wholesale) companies has been criticised for their formation. The critics can be divided into three groups:
#'' ''Politicians: Political criticism about the group size are reflected in the [[European Union competition law]] and [[competition law|anti-trust laws]].
#'' ''The Church: The Church's criticism comes through Christian [[catholic social teaching|social teaching]] (or [[business ethics|corporate ethics]]).
#'' ''Society: Social criticism can be found since the formation of the [[labour movement]], especially in the currents of [[Social democracy]] and [[Marxism]].
Since the emergence of [[social movement|New Social Movements]], corporations have also become the focus of movements such as the [[Environmental movement]] and the [[Anti-globalization movement]] (see [[Black Book brand companies]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">The '''core business''' of an organization is an idealized construct intended to express that organization's "main" or "essential" activity.  

The [[corporation|corporate]] trend in the mid-20th Century, of acquiring new enterprises and forming [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s, enabled [[corporation]]s to reduce costs funds and similar investment vehicles, and sometimes the following of a popular trend among corporate management seeking to appeal to current and impress investors.

Core business process means that a business's success depends not only on how well each department performs its work, but also on how well the company manages to coordinate departmental activities to conduct the core business process, which is;

1. '''The market-sensing process'''
Meaning all activities in gathering marketing intelligence and acting on the information.

2. '''The new-offering realization process'''
Covering all activities in research, development and launching new quality offerings quickly and within budget.

3. '''The customer acquisition process'''
all the activities defining the target market and prospecting for new customers

4. '''The customer relationship management process'''
all the activities covering building deeper understanding, relationships and offerings to individual customers.

5. '''The fulfillment management process'''
all the activities in receiving and approving orders, shipping out on time and collecting payment.

To be successful, a business needs to look for competitive advantages beyond its own operations. The business needs to look at the competitiveness value chain of suppliers, distributors and customers. Many companies today have partnered with specific suppliers and distributors to create a superior value delivery network.

'''Cross ownership''' is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership.

In the US, "cross ownership" also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.

==Cross ownership of stock==
Some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:
* [[Japan]]
* [[Germany]]

Positives of cross ownership:
* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners
* Promotes a slow rate of economic change

Cross ownership of shares is criticized for:
* Stagnating the economy
* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity
* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital

A major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains tax]] rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.

For example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 25% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,
the company has $800 which is 20 percent less than before it sold the stock.

Long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.

==Media cross ownership==
{{main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}

Cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's former ownership of [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with WGN Radio ([[WGN-AM]]) and Television ([[WGN-TV]]).

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.

The mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.

'''Disagree and commit''' is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it. The principle can also be understood as a statement about ''when'' it is useful to have conflict and disagreement, with the principle saying disagreement is useful in early states of [[decision-making]] while harmful after a decision has been made.&lt;ref name="Origbo"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://seekingmastery.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/make-disagree-and-commit-work-for-you/ | title = Make "Disagree and Commit" Work for You | website = Seeking Mastery | publisher = WordPress.com | first = Efesa | last = Origbo | date = May 29, 2017 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/140262 | title = Consensus trap {{!}} World Problems &amp; Global Issues | publisher = ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|The Encyclopedia of World Problems]]'' | accessdate = July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9s1QihGPIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | date = March 14, 2012 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | quote = Great teams avoid the consensus trap by embracing a concept that Intel, the legendary microchip manufacturer, calls "disagree and commit."

==History==

[[Scott McNealy]] used the phrase as early as sometime between 1983 and 1991, as part of the line "Agree and commit, disagree and commit, or get out of the way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;f=false | title = High Noon: The Inside Story of Scott McNealy and the Rise of Sun Microsystems | first = Karen | last = Southwick | year = 1999 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.| isbn = 9780471297130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Origbo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ecorner.stanford.edu/1642.ect | title = Agree and Commit, Disagree and Commit | first = Greg | last = Ballard | date = November 15, 2006 | publisher = Stanford eCorner | quote = This is a phrase, agree and commit, disagree and commit, that actually comes from Scott McNealy. At least that's where I was told it was from.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been attributed to [[Andrew Grove]] at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/patrick-lencioni/innovation-wont-get-you-very-far.html | title = Why Great Leadership Fuels Innovation | date = November 20, 2014 | publisher = Inc.com | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | quote = At Intel, Grove demanded not only that his people argue well, but also that they leave those argument-rich meetings fully committed to the decisions that had been made.

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added "Have a Backbone; Disagree and Commit" as one of its leadership principles sometime in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | title = Amazon.com: Amazon Values | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092317/http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | archivedate = 2011-05-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] mentioned the term in his "2016 Letter to Shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t | title = About Amazon - 2016 Letter to Shareholders | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | date = April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Due diligence''' is an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract, or an act with a certain [[standard of care]].

It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations. A common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoskisson |first=Robert E. |last2=Hitt |first2=Michael A. |last3=Ireland |first3=R. Duane |year=2004 |title=Competing for Advantage |location=Mason, OH |publisher=South-Western/Thomson Learning |page=251 |isbn=0-324-27158-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate in a reflexive manner on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=C. E. |year=2006 |title=Conducting Due Diligence |publisher=[[Practicing Law Institute]], New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term “due diligence” means "required carefulness" or "reasonable care" in general usage, and has been used in this sense since at least the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title='Due Diligence' Merriam-Webster entry |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/due%20diligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a specialized legal term and later a common business term due to the United States’ [[Securities Act of 1933]], where the process is called "reasonable investigation" (section 11b3). This Act included a defense at Section 11, referred to later in legal usage as the “due diligence” defense, which could be used by [[broker-dealer]]s when accused of inadequate disclosure to investors of [[material information]] with respect to the purchase of [[securities]]. In legal and business use, the term was soon used for the process itself instead of how it was to be performed, so that the original expressions such as "exercise due diligence in investigating" and "investigation carried out with due diligence" were soon shortened to "due diligence investigation" and finally "due diligence".

As long as broker-dealers exercised “due diligence” (required carefulness) in their investigation into the company whose [[Stock|equity]] they were selling and as long as they disclosed to the investor what they found, they would not be held liable for non-disclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation.

The broker-dealer community quickly institutionalized, as a standard practice, the conducting of due diligence investigations of any stock offerings in which they involved themselves. Originally the term was limited to public offerings of equity investments, but over time it has come to be associated with investigations of private mergers and acquisitions as well.

== Examples ==
=== Business transactions and corporate finance ===
Due diligence takes different forms depending on its purpose:
# The examination of a potential target for merger, acquisition, privatization, or similar corporate finance transaction normally by a buyer. (This can include self due diligence or “reverse due diligence”, i.e. an assessment of a company, usually by a third party on behalf of the company, prior to taking the company to market.)
# A reasonable investigation focusing on material future matters.
# An examination being achieved by asking certain key questions, including, how do we buy, how do we structure an acquisition, and how much do we pay?
# An investigation of current practices of process and policies.
# An examination aiming to make an acquisition decision via the principles of valuation and shareholder value analysis.&lt;ref name="Gillman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillman | first=Luis | year=2010 | title= Due Diligence, a Strategic and Financial Approach | edition=2nd |publisher=LexisNexis |location=Durban |isbn=978-0-409-04699-1 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The due diligence process (framework) can be divided into nine distinct areas:&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;

 {{Div col end}}

It is essential that the concepts of valuations (shareholder value analysis) be linked into a due diligence process. This is in order to reduce the number of failed mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillman |first= |year=2002 |journal=Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal |title=The link between valuations and due diligence |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=1096-3685 |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/Academy-Accounting-Financial-Studies-Journal/179817638.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, two new audit areas have been incorporated into the Due Diligence framework:&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;
* the Compatibility Audit which deals with the strategic components of the transaction and in particular the need to add shareholder value and
* the Reconciliation audit, which links/consolidates other audit areas together via a formal valuation in order to test whether shareholder value will be added.&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;

The relevant areas of concern may include the financial, legal, labor, tax, IT, environment and market/commercial situation of the company. Other areas include intellectual property, real and personal property, insurance and liability coverage, debt instrument review, employee benefits (including the [[Affordable Care Act]]) and labor matters, immigration, and international transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Truax|first1=Margret |title=M&amp;A Transactions: Affordable Care Act Due Diligence Considerations |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/ma-transactions-affordable-care-act-due-diligence-considerations |publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary M.

Due Diligence has emerged as a separate profession for accounting and auditing experts.

=== Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ===
{{main|Foreign Corrupt Practices Act}}
With the number and size of penalties increasing, the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) has caused many U.S. institutions to look into how they evaluate all of their relationships overseas. The lack of a due diligence of a company’s agents, vendors, and suppliers, as well as merger and acquisition partners in foreign countries could lead to doing business with an organization linked to a [[foreign official]] or state owned enterprises and their executives. This link could be perceived as leading to the bribing of the foreign officials and as a result lead to noncompliance with the FCPA. Due diligence in regard to FCPA compliance is required in two aspects:

# Initial due diligence – this step is necessary in evaluating what risk is involved in doing business with an entity prior to establishing a relationship and assesses risk at that point in time.
# Ongoing due diligence – this is the process of periodically evaluating each relationship overseas to find links between current business relationships overseas and ties to a [[foreign official]] or illicit activities linked to corruption. This process will be performed indefinitely as long as a relationship exists, and usually involves comparing the companies and executives to a database of foreign officials. This process should be performed on all relationships regardless of location&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcompliance.com/fcpa-definition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830160102/http://worldcompliance.com/fcpa-definition.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=mdy }} WorldCompliance.com&lt;/ref&gt; and is often part of a wider [[Integrity Management]] initiative . {{failed verification|date=November 2011}}

In the M&amp;A context, buyers can use the due diligence phase to integrate a target into their internal FCPA controls, focusing initial efforts on necessary revisions to the target's business activities with a high-risk of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brooks|first1=Robin | last2=Stacey |first2=Oliver | last3=Jarman|first3=Daniel |title=Tackling Corruption and Regulatory Risk in M&amp;A Transactions|url= https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/tackling-corruption-and-regulatory-risk-ma-transactions|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While financial institutions are among the most aggressive in defining FCPA best practices, manufacturing, retailing and energy industries are highly active in managing FCPA compliance programs.

===Human rights===
Passed on May 25, 2011, the [[OECD]] member countries agreed to revise their guidelines promoting tougher standards of corporate behavior, including human rights. As part of this new definition, they utilized a new aspect of due diligence that requires a corporation to investigate third party partners for potential abuse of human rights.

In the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises document, it is stated that all members will “Seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations, products or services by a business relationship, even if they do not contribute to those impacts”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/29/48004323.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904230329/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/29/48004323.pdf |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was originally put forth by UN Special Representative for Human Rights and Business [[John Ruggie]], who uses it as an umbrella to cover the steps and processes by which a company understands, monitors and mitigates its human rights impacts. [[Human Rights Impact Assessment]] is a component of this.

The UN formalized guidelines for Human Rights Due Diligence on June 16 with the endorsement of Ruggie’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf |title= Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary – General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie|publisher=Human Rights Council|date= |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil litigation ===
Due diligence in civil procedure is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of [[judicial relief|relief]] are requested.

For example, duly diligent efforts to locate and/or serve a party with civil process is frequently a requirement for a party seeking to use means other than [[service of process|personal service]] to obtain jurisdiction over a party. Similarly, in areas of the law such as [[bankruptcy]], an attorney representing someone filing a bankruptcy petition must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made in the bankruptcy petition are factually accurate. Due diligence is also generally prerequisite to a request for relief in states where civil litigants are permitted to conduct pre-litigation discovery of facts necessary to determine whether or not a party has a factual basis for a cause of action.

In civil actions seeking a foreclosure or seizure of property, a party requesting this relief is frequently required to engage in due diligence to determine who may claim an interest in the property by reviewing public records concerning the property and sometimes by a physical inspection of the property that would reveal a possible interest in the property of a tenant or other person.

Due diligence is also a concept found in the civil litigation concept of a [[statute of limitations]]. Frequently, a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when that plaintiff knew or should have known had that plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant. In this context, the term “due diligence” determines the scope of a party’s [[constructive knowledge]], upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute “inquiry notice” that alerts a would-be plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action.

=== Criminal law ===
In [[criminal law]], due diligence is the only available defense to a crime that is one of [[strict liability]] (i.e., a crime that only requires an [[actus reus]] and no [[mens rea]]). Once the criminal offence is proven, the defendant must prove on balance that they did everything possible to prevent the act from happening. It is not enough that they took the normal standard of care in their industry – they must show that they took every reasonable precaution.

Due diligence is also used in criminal law to describe the scope of the duty of a prosecutor, to take efforts to turn over potentially [[exculpatory evidence]], to (accused) criminal defendants.

In criminal law, “due diligence” also identifies the standard a prosecuting entity must satisfy in pursuing an action against a defendant, especially with regard to the provision of the Federal and State Constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial or to have a warrant or detainer served in an action. In cases where a defendant is in any type of custodial situation where their freedom is constrained, it is solely the prosecuting entities duty to ensure the provision of such rights and present the citizen before the court with jurisdiction. This also applies where the respective judicial system and/or prosecuting entity has current address or contact information on the named party and said party has made no attempt to evade notice of the prosecution of the action.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Revised Statues 353-66.5 and 604-7.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, "proper use of a due diligence system" may be used as a defence against a charge of breach of regulations e.g. under the Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/233/pdfs/uksi_20130233_en.pdf Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013, SI 233/2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1312/pdfs/uksi_20171312_en.pdf Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, SI 1312/2017]&lt;/ref&gt; businesses may be able to defend a charge of non-compliance with regulations if they can show that they have undertaken supplier due diligence to a necessary standard.

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

'''Ensure''' is the brand name of [[nutritional supplement]]s and [[meal replacement]]s manufactured by [[Abbott Laboratories]]. 

A 237-ml (8-fl oz) bottle of Ensure Original contains 220 [[calorie]]s, six grams of [[fat]], 15 grams of [[sugar]], and nine grams of [[protein]]. The top six ingredients are water, corn [[maltodextrin]], sugar, [[milk protein concentrate]], [[canola oil]], and [[soy protein]] isolate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ensure.com/nutrition-products/ensure-original "Ensure® Original Milk Chocolate Nutrition Shake"], ensure.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1903, Harry C. Moores and Stanley M. Ross launched the "Moores &amp; Ross Milk Company", which specialized in bottling milk for home delivery for the first few years.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross  Laboratories|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Ross_Laboratories|website=Ohio History Central|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, however, the company merged with Abbott Laboratories. A drink called Ensure was first marketed by Ross Laboratories in 1973.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

In the 1990s, Ensure and other nutritional drink products like [[Mead Johnson]]'s Sustacal and [[Nestlé]]'s Boost and Resource brands were fiercely competing to capture market share among healthy adults.&lt;ref name=NYT1997/&gt; In 1996, Ensure had sales of about $300 million and accounted for 80% of protein supplement sales; Abbott spent $45.4 million to advertise Ensure during the first nine months of 1996, around 70% more than it spent during the same period of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellene|first1=Denise|title=Ensure Maker Settles Ad Charges|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-03/business/fi-14929_1_ensure-protein|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] said that ads for Ensure were "the most misleading food ad" of that year.&lt;ref name=NYT1997/&gt; In 1997, Abbott settled charges from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] that it was falsely marketing Ensure as having a similar amount of vitamins as multivitamin supplements, as being recommended by doctors more than any other nutritional supplement, and as being recommended by doctors as a way to stay healthy and active for people who were otherwise healthy.&lt;ref name=NYT1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burros|first1=Marian|title=Eating Well|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/08/garden/eating-well.html|work=The New York Times|date=8 January 1997 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket No. C-3745: In the Matter of Abbot Laboratories, a corporation.|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1997/06/c3745cmp.pdf|publisher=FTC|date=May 30, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
When Abbott split off its pharmaceuticals division, [[Abbvie]], in 2013, the Ensure product line remained with Abbott with the other nutritional products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marbury|first1=Donna|title=As Abbott and AbbVie move toward split-up, Wall Street waits|url=http://newsarchive.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news-211938.html|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=Medill Reports|date=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ECBE's [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] process is based upon self and peer evaluation, aimed to ensure the continual improvement of educational quality. ECBE is overseen by a Board of Directors elected from the accredited members. A separate Board of Commissioners, independent of the Board of Directors are selected to oversee the application of procedures and the awarding of accreditation. ECBE is a registered affiliate of the [[European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education]] (ENQA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=AFFILIATES ENQA|url=http://www.enqa.eu/index.php/enqa-agencies/affiliates/|journal=http://www.enqa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) International Quality Group (IQG) [https://web.archive.org/web/20141003190226/http://www.cheainternational.org/pdf/CIQG%20Members.pdf]

{{European patent law}}
The '''European Patent Convention''' ('''EPC'''), also known as the '''Convention on the Grant of European Patents''' of 5 October 1973, is a multilateral [[treaty]] instituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] and providing an autonomous legal system according to which '''European patents''' are granted.  The term ''European patent'' is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents,&lt;ref name="SingerArt2andScourfield"&gt;The view that a European patent issues as independent national patents in each designated Contracting state is very convenient from a practical point of view. Some however consider this view as incorrect:
:"''The view that, after grant, a European patent breaks up into a bundle of national patents in designated Contracting States may appear plausible, but it is incorrect both in law and systematically''", Singer/Stauder, ''The European Patent Convention, A Commentary'', Munich, 2003, under Article 2.
Singer/Stauder's view seems in turn rather theoretical in view of decisions ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'' and ''GAT v LUK'' of the [[European Court of Justice]] (see also "Enforcement and validity" section), which reinforced the independent character of a European patent in each Contracting State. As Tom Scourfield wrote in an article commenting on these two decisions:
:"''(...) a European patent is no more than a bundle of national patents pursuant to a single application. Until a true community patent becomes a reality it seems likely that true community enforcement will continue to elude patent owners.''" Tom Scourfield, ''Jurisdiction and Patents: ECJ rules on forum for validity and cross-border patent enforcement'', The CIPA Journal, August 2006, Volume 35 No. 8, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition procedure]], which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and [[limitation and revocation procedures]], which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.

The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a single, harmonised procedure before the [[European Patent Office]]. A single [[patent application]], in one language,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be filed at the European Patent Office in [[Munich]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its branch in [[The Hague]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"/&gt;{{refn|The Hague branch of the EPO is actually located in [[Rijswijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g880007ep1.html Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 7/88 (Administrative Agreement) of 16.11.1990], Summary of Facts and Submissions, V.(3)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} at its sub-office in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj1989/p189_270.pdf Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 10 May 1989 on the setting up of a Filing Office in the Berlin sub-office of the European Patent Office]'', OJ 1989, 218&lt;/ref&gt; or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.&lt;ref name="Art75-1-b"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and rationale==
Before 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages.  While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.

== History ==

In September 1949, French Senator [[Henri Longchambon]] proposed to the [[Council of Europe]] the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the "Longchambon plan", marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bossung |first=Otto |title=The Return of European Patent Law in the European Union |journal=IIC |volume=27 |issue=3/1996 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |url=http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |quote=Work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent" had begun in Strasbourg in 1949 with the Longchambon plan. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232011/http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the [[European Convention relating to the Formalities required for Patent Applications|formalities required for patent applications]] (1953) and one on the [[European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention|international classification of patent]] (1954).&lt;ref name="Tookey"&gt;G. W. Tookey, ''Patents in the European Field'' in Council of Europe, Council of Europe staff, ''European Yearbook 1969'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1971, pages 76–97, {{ISBN|90-247-1218-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the [[Strasbourg Patent Convention]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Tookey"/&gt;

In 1973, the ''Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents'' took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the "Munich Convention"). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which [[Kurt Haertel]], considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and [[François Savignon]] played a decisive role.

The Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: [[Belgium]], Germany (then [[West Germany]]), France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for [[Sweden]]. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the [[European Patent Organisation#Administrative Council|Administrative Council]] which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977).  Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.

The EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Turkey]], [[Monaco]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[San Marino]], [[Albania]] and [[Serbia]] are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of January 2015, in force in 38 countries.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/epo/member-states.html|title=Member states of the European Patent Organisation|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref name="serbia"/&gt;

A diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in [[international law]] and to add a level of judicial review of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal]] decisions. The revised text, informally called the [[EPC 2000]], entered into force on 13 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|Official Journal of the EPO]], 2/2006, [http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj006/02_06/02_1386.pdf ''Notice from the European Patent Office dated 27 January 2006 concerning deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the EPC Revision Act'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation agreements with non-contracting states: extension and validation agreements===
Throughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became "extension states" or "validation states", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to {{EPC Article|33|4}}, are not based on a "direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/a/index.htm|title=National Law relating to EPC|publisher=EPO|quote=The extension system largely corresponds to the EPC system operating in the EPC contracting states, except that it is based not on direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC. It is therefore subject to the national extension rules of the country concerned.|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|1}}: "Extension agreements and ordinances", "Legal nature"&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is "not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|2}}: "No jurisdiction of the boards of appeal"&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2015, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]]&lt;ref name="ME"/&gt; have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application. Several other "extension states" have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called "validation agreements" with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150119.html|title=Morocco recognises European patents as national patents|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=19 January 2015|work=European Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150302.html|title=Validation agreement with Morocco enters into force|date=1 March 2015|publisher=EPO|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moldova-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20151008.html|title=European patents to cover Moldova|date=8 October 2015|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunisia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2017/20171004.html|title=Brevets européens en Tunisie : L’accord de validation entre l’OEB et la Tunisie entrera en vigueur le 1er décembre|trans-title=European patents in Tunisia: The validation agreement between the EPO and Tunisia will enter into force on December 1|date=3 October 2017|publisher=European Patent Office|language=French|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/foundation/validation-states.html|title=Validation states|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="validation-agreement-KH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/information-epo/archive/20180209.html|title=Validation of European patents in Cambodia (KH) with effect from 1 March 2018|date=9 February 2018|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal nature and content ==
{{EPC requirements}}
The European Patent Convention is "a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the [[Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] of 19 June 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/apre.html|title=Preamble [of the European Patent Convention]|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}} See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/g980002ep1.pdf Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G2/98], "Reasons for the Opinion", point 3, first sentence: "The EPC constitutes, according to its preamble, a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention".&lt;/ref&gt; The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 38 countries, although the [[European Union patent]] would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.

The content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ma1.html|title=The European Patent Convention|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* the "Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European patents", commonly known as the "Implementing Regulations". The function of the Implementing Regulations is "to determine in more detail how the Articles should be applied".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iii|h|6}}: "Implementing Regulations"&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the Implementing Regulations, the provisions of the EPC prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Protocol on Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions in respect of the right to the grant of a European patent", commonly known as the "Protocol on Recognition". This protocol deals with the right to the grant of a European patent but exclusively applies to European patent applications.
* the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Patent Organisation", commonly known as the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities";
* the "Protocol on the Centralisation of the European Patent System and on its Introduction", commonly known as the "Protocol on Centralisation";
* the "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the Convention";
* the "Protocol on the Staff Complement of the European Patent Office at The Hague", commonly known as the "Protocol on Staff Complement".

== Substantive patent law ==
One of the most important articles of the Convention, {{EPC Article|52|1}}, entitled  "''Patentable [[invention]]s''", states:
{{quotation|European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, providing that they are [[Novelty under the European Patent Convention|new]], involve an [[inventive step under the European Patent Convention|inventive step]], and are susceptible of [[industrial applicability|industrial application]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{EPC Article|52|1}}. The state of the art is further defined in Articles 54(2)-(5), and a limited grace period is specified in {{EPC Article|55}}, but this is only relevant in cases of breach of confidence or disclosure of the invention in a recognised international exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article constitutes the "fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions".&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"&gt; [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t040154ex1.htm Decision T 154/04] of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6, to be published at the [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.

First, [[discovery (observation)|discoveries]], [[theory|scientific theories]], mathematical methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic creations,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presentations of information&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not regarded as inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is "a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC."&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"/&gt; ''(For further information, see also: [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|Software patents under the EPC]]).''

The second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include
* inventions contrary to "''ordre public''" or morality,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] methods practised on the human or animal body,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been excluded for "socio-ethical considerations and considerations of [[public health]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/cdd5fb0c3153e9c3c12576cb00563d2d/$FILE/G1_07_en.pdf Decision G 1/07 of February 15, 2010], Reasons 3.3.6. See also [[G 1/07]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unified prosecution phase ==
{{main|Grant procedure before the European Patent Office}}

The Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.

European patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in a language other than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14|2}}; {{EPO Guidelines|a|vii|1|1}}: "Admissible languages; time limit for filing the translation of the application"; "European patent applications can be filed in any language."&lt;/ref&gt; within two months from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|6|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the "language of proceedings" and is used by the EPO for communications.

European patent applications are [[patent prosecution|prosecuted]] in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.

During the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and "the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the [[invention]] is desired,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; and the designations need to be "confirmed" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once granted by the EPO,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.

==Opposition==
{{main|Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office}}

There are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the [[limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation procedures]]. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute).  National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.

== Grant, effect and need for translations ==

In contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the opposition procedure and even after it has ended, particular acts can still be performed before the European Patent Office, such as requesting a rectification of an incorrect designation of inventor under {{EPC Rule|19|1}}. {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; "Rectification may [indeed] be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated" (Guid. A III 5.6).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State&lt;ref&gt;There is no consistent usage of a particular expression to refer to "the European patent in a particular designated Contracting State for which it is granted". The article uses the expression "a European patent in a Contracting State" which is considered to be the most consistent with the authoritative text, i.e. the EPC.&lt;/ref&gt; is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.

A European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the [[European Patent Bulletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}: EP patent has same effect as national patent in "each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted"; {{EPC Article|97|2) and (4}}: decision to grant "for the designated Contracting States" is made by the examining division.&lt;/ref&gt; That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).

A translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have "prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European patent is ''[[void ab initio]]'' in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Veronese|Watchorn|2011|}}, Chapter XI.4&lt;/ref&gt; If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|2}}; [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/national/html/en/iv/index.htm National law, Chapter IV, Filing of translations of the patent specification under Article 65 EPC] (regarding implementation in EPC Contracting States)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement and validity ==
{{main|Enforcement of European patents}}
Almost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{EPC Article|2|2}}, {{EPC Article|64|1) and(3}}, {{EPC Article|66}}, {{EPC Article|74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings – including [[renewal (patent)|renewal]], revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and [[patent infringement|infringement enforcement]] are determined under national law.

EPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9-month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.

===Infringement===
[[patent infringement|Infringement]] is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the "direct product of a patented process" to be an infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "extent of the protection" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and [[patent drawing|drawing]]s, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a "fair" middle position, neither "strict, literal" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Southco Inc v Dzus'', [1992] R.P.C. 299 CA; ''Improver Corp. v Remington Products Inc'' [1990] FSR 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerArt2Precedence"&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|Stauder|2003}}, under Article 2, section "EPC provisions on European patents that take precedence over national law"&lt;/ref&gt;

All other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]].  In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]], the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
Validity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. {{EPC Article|138|1}} limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:

* if the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable within the terms of Articles 52 to 57 EPC (see "Substantive patent law" section above);
* if the [[disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention|disclosure does not permit the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if [[amendments under the European Patent Convention|amendments have been made]] such that the subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|c}}, {{EPC Article|123|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if the claims have been broadened post-grant, e.g. in opposition proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|d}}, {{EPC Article|123|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an improper proprietor&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|e}}, {{EPC Article|60}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in some jurisdictions, only the person pretending to be entitled to the European patent can raise this specific ground, so that the resulting nullity of the patent may be relative to some persons only&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Teyssedre, [http://europeanpatentcaselaw.blogspot.com/2012/03/la-nullite-tiree-du-motif-de-lart-1381.html ''La nullité tirée du motif de l'Art 138(1) e) est relative''], Le blog du droit européen des brevets, 5 March 2012. Consulted on 10 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—.

A national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.

A European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.

== Term (duration) of a European patent ==

The EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a [[Term of patent|term]] of 20 years from the filing date,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|PCT]] designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the [[priority right|priority date]], which can be up to one year earlier.  The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states this is by means of a [[supplementary protection certificate]].

== Relation with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==

A European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into "European regional phase",&lt;ref&gt;See {{PCT Article|11|3}}, which provides a [[legal fiction]] according to which an international application, i.e. a PCT application, has the effect of a regular European patent application as of the international filing date under certain conditions (see for instance [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j090018ex1.html Decision J 18/09 of the Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.01 of 1 September 2010], Reasons 7 and 8); and {{EPC Article|150|2), (first sentence}}: "International applications filed under the PCT may be the subject of proceedings before the European Patent Office."&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a "Euro-PCT application" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|viii|2}}: "EPO as designated or elected Office".&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|150|2), (third sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve EPC Contracting States, namely [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], France, [[Greece]], Ireland, Italy, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Slovenia]] have "closed their national route".&lt;ref&gt;For Malta, source: "European Patent Office web site, [http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html ''Accession to the PCT by Malta (MT)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220506/http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html |date=26 September 2007 }}, Information from the European Patent Office, January 2, 2007; for Latvia, source: [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2007/pct_news_2007_4.pdf ''Latvia: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] of April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. Lithuania closed its "national route" most recently, on 4 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_02.pdf ''Lithuania: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] No. 02/2012, p. 1.; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2014/pct_news_2014_05.pdf|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|work=PCT Newsletter No. 05/2014|publisher=WIPO|page=3|accessdate=11 May 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|date=July–August 2014|work=PCT Newsletter No. 07-08/2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142535/http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''everywoman''' is a membership organisation that champions the advancement of women in business to close the gender pay gap. It provides personal development resources, leadership training, events, award programmes, networking opportunities and inspiration for women in business and female entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everywoman.com/ |title=Women in Business &amp;#124; Personal Development &amp;#124; Role Models |publisher=Everywoman.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

everywoman believes that getting greater representation of women across all business areas will drive better, more profitable businesses, creating wider benefits for both women and men in the workplace.

They work closely with government, opinion formers and business support organisations, and are supported by leading corporate partners including [[NatWest]] &amp; [[Specsavers]].

In November 2010 everywoman launched the Modern Muse project, designed to engage the next generation of female business leaders and entrepreneurs by showcasing women of today in all walks of business life.

'''Expander System Sweden AB''' is a Swedish company that designs, manufactures, and sells a pivot-pin system for commercial heavy machinery and equipment.  Their headquarters is in [[Åtvidaberg]], [[Sweden]]. It was founded in 1986 by Everth and Roger Svensson. The Expander Group includes two subsidiaries, Expander Americas Inc, in the [[United States]], and Expander Deutschland GmbH, in [[Germany]].

The expander system consists of patented products that are intended to take the place of conventional pivot pins in [[heavy machinery]] and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called [[Boring (manufacturing)|line boring]]. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.

Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is a modelling language which combines [[structural modelling]], [[business process modelling]], [[goal modelling]] with goal hierarchies and [[resource modelling]]. It was intended to bridge the gap between goal modelling and other modelling approaches. According to Johannesson and Söderström (2008) "the process logic in EEML is mainly expressed through nested structures of tasks and decision points. The sequencing of tasks is expressed by the flow relation between decision points. Each task has an input port and the output port being decision points for modeling process logic".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johannesson and Eva Söderström (2008) .''Information Systems Engineering''. p.58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

EEML was designed as a simple language, making it easy to update models. In addition to capturing tasks and their interdependencies, models show which roles perform each task, and the tools, services and information they apply.

==History==
Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is from the late 1990s, developed in the EU project EXTERNAL as extension of the Action Port Model (APM) by S. Carlsen (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Carlsen, S. (1998). "Action port model: A mixed paradigm conceptual workflow modeling language". In: ''Proceedings of Third IFCIS Conference on Cooperative Information Systems'' (CoopIS'98), New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The EXTERNAL project &lt;ref&gt;EXTERNAL EXTERNAL - ''Extended Enterprise Resources, Networks And Learning'', EU Project,
IST-1999-10091,&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to "facilitate inter-organisational cooperation in knowledge intensive industries. The project worked on the hypothesis that interactive process models form a suitable framework for tools and methodologies for dynamically networked organisations. In the project EEML (Extended Enterprise Modelling Language) was first constructed as a common metamodel, designed to enable syntactic and semantic interoperability".&lt;ref&gt;Håvard D. Jørgensen (2004). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/phd/Jorgensen-thesis.pdf ''Interactive Process Models'']. Thesis Norwegian University of Science and Technology
Trondheim, Norway. p.173-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was further developed in the EU projects Unified Enterprise Modelling Language (UEML)&lt;ref&gt;[[François Vernadat]] (2002). "UEML: towards a unified enterprise modelling language". In: ''Int. J. Production Research'', 40 (17), 4309-4321.&lt;/ref&gt; from 2002 to 2003 and the ongoing ATHENA project.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]] and [[T.A. Halpin]], Keng Siau (2004). ''Information Modeling Methods and Methodologies''. Idea Group Inc (IGI), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the UEML Working group were to "define, to validate and to disseminate a set of core language constructs to support a Unified Language for Enterprise Modelling, named UEML, to serve as a basis for interoperability within a smart organisation or a network of enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=072ba8459dce4167a84182c016b32551 Unified Enterprise Modelling Language]. Accessed 29 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

===Modeling domains===
The EEML-language is divided into 4 sub-languages, with well-defined links across these languages:&lt;ref name="Kro06"&gt;[[John Krogstie]] (2006). [http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-337/paper9.pdf " Using EEML for Combined Goal and Process Oriented Modeling: A Case Study"].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Process modelling]]
* [[Data modelling]]
* [[Resource modelling]]
* [[Goal modelling]]
Process modelling in EEML, according to Krogstie (2006) "supports the modeling of process logic which is mainly expressed through nested structures of tasks and decision points. The sequencing of the tasks is expressed by the flow relation between decision points. Each task has minimum an input port and an output port being decision points for modeling process logic, Resource roles are used to connect resources of various kinds (persons, organisations, information, material objects, software tools and manual tools) to the tasks. In addition, data modeling (using UML class diagrams), goal modeling and competency modeling (skill requirements and skills possessed) can be integrated with the process models".&lt;ref name="Kro06"/&gt;

===Layers===
EEML has four layers of interest:
* '''Generic Task Type''': This layer identifies the constituent tasks of generic, repetitive processes and the logical dependencies between these tasks.
* '''Specific Task Type''': At this layer, we deal with process modelling in another scale, which is more linked to the concretisation, decomposition and specialisation phases. Here process models are expanded and elaborated to facilitate business solutions. From an integration viewpoint, this layer aims at uncovering more efficiently the dependencies between the sub-activities, with regards for the resources required for actual performance.
* '''Manage Task Instances''': The purpose of this layer consists in providing constraints but also useful resources (in the form of process templates) to the planning and performance of an enterprise process. The performance of organisational, information, and tool resources in their environment are highlighted through concrete resources allocation management.
* '''Perform Task Instances''': Here is covered the actual execution of tasks with regards to issues of empowerment and decentralisation. At this layer, resources are utilised or consumed in an exclusive or shared manner.

These tasks are tied together through another layer called '''Manage Task Knowledge''' which allows to achieve a global interaction through the different layers by performing a real consistency between them. According to EEML 2005 Guide, this Manage Task Knowledge can be defined as the collection of processes necessary for innovation, dissemination, and exploitation of knowledge in a co-operating ensemble where interact knowledge seekers and knowledge sources by the means of a shared knowledge base.

===Goal modelling===
{{further|Goal modeling}}
Goal modelling is one of the four EEML modelling domains age. A goal expresses the wanted (or unwanted) state of affairs (either current or future) in a certain context. Example of the goal model is depicted below. It shows goals and relationships between them. It is possible to model advanced goal-relationships in EEML by using goal connectors. A goal connector is used when one need to link several goals.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:Eemlgoal.JPG|Goal modeling in EEML
File:Goal modeling Tabel.gif|Connecting relationships
Image:Goalandprocess.JPG|Goal modeling and process modeling
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In goal modelling to fulfil Goal1, one must achieve to other goals: both Goal2 and Goal3 (goal-connector with “and” as the logical relation going out). If Goal2 and Goal3 are two different ways of achieving Goal1, then it should be “xor” logical relationship. It can be an opposite situation when both Goal2 and Goal3 need to be fulfilled and to achieve them one must fulfil Goal1. In this case Goal2 and Goal3 are linked to goal connector and this goal connector has a link to Goal1 with ”and”-logical relationship.

The table indicates different types of connecting relationships in EEML goal modelling. Goal model can also be interlinked with a process model.

==Goal and process oriented modelling==
We can describe process model as models that comprise a set of activities and an activity can be decomposed into sub-activities.&lt;ref name=eeml1&gt;
Yun Lin and Arne Sølvberg Goal Annotation of Process Models for Semantic Enrichment of Process Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt; These activities have relationship amongst themselves. A goal describes the expected state of operation in a business enterprise and it can be linked to whole process model or to a process model fragment with each level activity in a process model can be considered as a goal.&lt;ref name =eeml1 /&gt;

Goals are related in a hierarchical format where you find some goals are dependent on other sub goals for them to be complete which means all the sub goals must be achieved for the main goal to be achieved. There is other goals where only one of the goals need to be fulfilled for the main goal to be achieved. In goal modelling, there is use of deontic operator which falls in between the context and achieved state.&lt;ref name=emml2&gt;J. Krogstie (2005) EEML2005: EXTENDED ENTERPRISE MODELING LANGUAGE&lt;/ref&gt; Goals apply to tasks, milestones, resource roles and resources as well and can be considered as action rule for at task. EEML rules were also possible to although the goal modelling requires much more consultation in finding the connections between rules on the different levels.&lt;ref name=eeml3&gt;John Krogstie (2008) Using EEML for Combined Goal and Process Oriented Modeling: A Case Study. IDI, NTNU,Trondheim, Norway. Proceedings of EMMSAD 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Goal-oriented analysis focuses on the description and evaluation of alternatives and their relationship to the organisational objectives.&lt;ref name=eeml4&gt;	[[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos]], Chung, and Yu (1999) : “From Object-oriented to Goal-oriented Requirements Analysis”. Communications of the ACM, January&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource modeling==
Resources have specific roles during the execution of various processes in an organisation. The following icons represent the various resources required in modelling.

The relations of these resources can be of different types:
:a.	Is Filled By – this is the assignment relation between roles and resources. It has a cardinality of one-to-many relationship.
:b.	Is Candidate For – candidate indicates the possible filling of the role by a resource.
:c.	Has Member – this is a kind of relations between organisation and person by denoting that a certain person has membership in the organisation. Has a cardinality of many-to-many relation.
:d.	Provide Support To – support pattern between resources and roles.
:e.	Communicates With – Communication pattern between resources and roles.
:f.	Has Supervision Over – shows which role resource supervises another role or resource.
:g.	Is Rating Of – describes the relation between  skill and a person or organisation.
:h.	Is required By – this is the primary skill required for this role
:i.	Has Access to – creating of models with the access rights.

==Benefits==
From a general point of view, EEML can be used like any other modelling languages in numerous cases. However we can highlight the virtual enterprise example, which can be considered as a direct field of application for EEML with regard to Extended Enterprise planning, operation, and management.
* Knowledge sharing: Create and maintain a shared understanding of the scope and purpose of the enterprise, as well as viewpoints on how to fulfil the purpose.
* Dynamically networked organisations: Make knowledge as available as possible within the organisation.
* Heterogeneous infrastructures: Achieve a relevant knowledge sharing process through heterogeneous infrastructures.
* Process knowledge management: Integrate the different business processes levels of abstraction.
* Motivation: creates enthusiasm and commitment among members of an organisation to follow up on the various actions that are necessary to restructure the enterprise.

EEML can help organisations meet these challenges by modelling all the manufacturing and logistics processes in the extended enterprise. This model allows capturing a rich set of relationships between the organisation, people, processes and resources of the virtual enterprise.&lt;ref name=eeml5&gt;H.D. Jørgensen (2004) Interactive Process Models. Department of Computer and Information Science Faculty of Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.  Trondheim, Norway&lt;/ref&gt; It also aims at making people understand, communicate, develop and cultivate solutions to business problems&lt;ref name=eeml6&gt;R. Matulevičius and P. Heymans (2007) Visually Effective Goal Models Using KAOS. PReCISE Research Center, Computer Science Department, University of Namur, rue Grandgagnage 21,5000 Namur, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. Krogstie (2008), enterprise models can be created to serve various purposes which include:

# Human sense making and communication – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to make sense of the real world aspects of an enterprise in order to facilitate communicate with parties involved.
# Computer assisted analysis – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to gain knowledge about the enterprise through simulation and computation of various parameters.
# Model deployment and activation – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to integrate the model in an enterprise-wide information system and enabling on-line information retrieval and direct work process guidance.

EEML enables Extended Enterprises to build up their operation based on standard processes through allowing modelling of all actors, processes and tasks in the Extended Enterprise and thereby have clear description of the Extended Enterprise. Finally, models developed will be used to measure and evaluate the Extended Enterprise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">The '''Global Network for Advanced Management''' is a collaboration of [[graduate school]]s of business that seeks to foster intellectual ties among [[business school]]s, students and deans&lt;ref name="GlobeandMail"&gt;[http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/b-schools-create-alliance-to-prosper-in-a-global-market/article4170273/?service=mobile B-schools create alliance to prosper in a global market]. ''The Globe and Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; from both economically strong regions and those on the horizon of [[economic development]]. It was founded by a consortium of 21 schools and launched on April 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedmanagement.net/#missionSub1 {{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Network has since expanded to include 30 member schools.&lt;ref name="advancedmanagement.net"&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/whos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The Global Network for Advanced Management was founded on the premise that enterprises need leaders who understand how markets and organizations work in increasingly diverse and complex contexts.&lt;ref name="GNFAM"&gt;[http://www.advancedmanagement.net/ Global Network for Advanced Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The network provides an organizational structure to facilitates connections among faculty, students, and alumni from diverse regions, cultures, and economies in different phases of development. Chief goals are the exchange of ideas, collaboration on [[data collection]], and the promotion of research in areas of interest to global [[commerce]]. Member schools share course materials, including [[Case study|case studies]] that incorporate specialized regional expertise.

==Activities==
The Global Network is a platform for innovation, hosting programs that include Global Network Weeks, which give students at network schools the opportunity to travel to another Network school for a one-week intensive mini-course that takes advantage of localized expertise;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/network-weeks&lt;/ref&gt; Global Network Courses, online graduate-level business courses that connect students at member schools in group project work;&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/programs/global-network-courses&lt;/ref&gt; and Global Network cases, teaching materials that examine business challenges from the points of view of at least two Global Network regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedmanagement.net/cases&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Global Network hosted two sessions at "Business + Society: Leadership in an Increasingly Complex World," a conference at the [[Yale School of Management]]. Deans and directors from nine Global Network schools discussed the skills they believed critical to leaders with moderator [[Margaret Warner]] in a panel entitled "Preparing Leaders for a Flatter World."&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/preparing-leaders-flatter-world&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty, deans, and students from three network schools participated in "Bank of Ireland: A Raw Case Study" with American investor [[Wilbur Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/edward-p-evans-hall/opening-events/business-society-leadership-increasingly-complex-world/bank-ireland-raw-case-study&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The network includes graduate management schools on six continents, with members in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="advancedmanagement.net"/&gt;

'''Hamburger University''' is a {{convert|130000|sqft|sing=on}} [[training]] facility of [[McDonald's]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], a western [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of [[restaurant management]]. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.&lt;ref name="hamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/corporate_careers/training_and_development/hamburger_university.html|title=Hamburger University|publisher=McDonald's|date=2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an {{convert|80|acre}} campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder [[Ray Kroc]] oversaw lessons at its beginning.

In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/13/mcdonalds-moving-headquarters-to-chicago/85821422/ McDonald's moving headquarters to downtown Chicago by 2018] (Retrieved from USA Today on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mcdonalds-headquarters-0603-biz-20160602-story.html McDonald's to move HQ to Chicago as soon as 2018, source says] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-property-20180112-story.html McDonald's begins selling off Oak Brook property before headquarters move] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus.

==Popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, ''[[Hamburger... The Motion Picture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BFI Explore|id=4ce2b722ee9e8|title=Hamburger - The Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with [[Ronald McDonald]] in which several [[animatronic]] hamburgers were shown graduating from school.

{{Companies law}}
A '''limited partnership''' ('''LP''') is a form of [[partnership]] similar to a [[general partnership]] except that while a general partnership must have at least two general partners (GPs), a limited partnership must have at least one GP and at least one limited partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. |last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| pages = 190| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPs are, in all major respects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm: they have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have [[joint and several liability]] for the [[debt]]s of the partnership.

As in a general partnership, the GPs have actual authority, as [[agency law|agents]] of the firm, to bind the partnership in [[contract]]s with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. As with a general partnership, "an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners."&lt;ref&gt;United States [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] § 402(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of limited liability==
Like [[shareholder]]s in a [[corporation]], limited partners have [[limited liability]]. This means that the limited partners have no management authority, and (unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guarantee) are not liable for the debts of the partnership. The limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment (similar to a [[dividend]]), the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement. General Partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners, and in cases of financial loss, the GPs will be the ones which are personally liable.

Limited partners are subject to the same alter-ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the partnership and the members do not co-mingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce the veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/piercing-the-corporate-veil/ |title=What is "Piercing the Corporate Veil" |last= |first= |publisher= |date=21 May 2015 |website=Law 4 Small Business |access-date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnership interests (including the interests of limited partners) are afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor’s share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

When the partnership is being constituted, or the composition of the firm is changing, limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] registration office. Limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties, so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability. It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent [[Agency (law)|agency]] authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently ''held out'' as agents (and so create an agency by [[estoppel]]); or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority.

Limited partnerships are distinct from [[limited liability partnership]]s, in which all partners have limited liability. In some jurisdictions, the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management.

==History==
The ''societates publicanorum'', which arose in [[Rome]] in the third century BC, may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership. During the heyday of the [[Roman Empire]], they were roughly equivalent to today's [[corporation]]s. Some had many investors, and interests were publicly tradable. However, they required at least one (and often several) partners with unlimited liability.&lt;ref name=Malmendier&gt;Malmendier, Ulrike; ''Societas publicanorum: staatliche Wirtschaftsaktivitäten in den Händen privater Unternehmer ''; Böhlau Verlag; Cologne, FRG;  2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept's roots===
According to Jairus Banaji, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''[[Mudaraba]]'' institutions in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic economic jurisprudence|economic jurisprudence]] were similar to the modern limited partnership. In medieval [[Italy]], a business organization known as the ''commenda'' appeared in the 10th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade. In a commenda, the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability, and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract. In contrast, his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk. A ''commenda'' was not a common form for a long-term business venture as most long-term businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml ''Law and the Rise of the Firm''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224214019/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; 119; Harvard Library; Rev.; Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, and Richard Squire; p. 1333; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As an institution, the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Robert H.; ''Limited Liability in Historical Perspective'', "Washington and Lee Law Review," Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colbert's Ordinance]] (1673) and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1807) reinforced the limited partnership concept in European law. In the [[United States]], limited partnerships became widely available in the early 19th century, although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures. Britain enacted its first limited partnership statute in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml ''Entity Shielding and the Development of Business Forms: A Comparative Perspective''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224190251/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; p. 119; Harvard Library; Rev. F.; Lamoreaux, Naomi R. and Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent; p. 238 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
:''For a list of types of corporation and other business types by country, see [[Types of business entity]].''

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the limited partnership organization is most common among [[film industry|film production companies]] and real estate investment projects, or in types of businesses that focus on a single or limited-term project. They are also useful in "[[manual labour|labor]]-[[Capital (economics)|capital]]" partnerships, where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work. In such situations, liability is the driving concern behind the choice of limited partnership status. The limited partnership is also attractive to firms wishing to provide shares to many individuals without the additional tax liability of a corporation. [[Private equity]] companies almost exclusively use a combination of general and limited partners for their investment funds. Well-known limited partnerships include [[Enterprise Products]] and [[Blackstone Group]] (both of which are [[Public company|public companies]]), and [[Bloomberg L.P.]] (a [[private company]]).

Before 2001, the limited liability enjoyed by limited partners was contingent upon their refraining from taking any active role in the management of the firm. However, Section 303 of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (if adopted by a state legislature) eliminates the so-called "control rule" with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings limited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.

The 2001 amendments to the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] (to the extent the amendments are adopted by state legislature) also permitted limited partnerships to become [[Limited Liability Limited Partnership]]s in states that adopt the change. Under this form, debts of a limited liability limited partnership are solely the responsibility of the partnership, thereby removing general-partner liability for partnership obligations. This change was made in response to the common practice of naming a limited-liability entity as a 1% general partner that controlled the limited partnership and organizing the managers as limited partners. This practice granted a general partner de facto limited liability under the partnership structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on this practice and background on the modification of GP liability, see Thomas E. Geau &amp; Barry B. Nekritz, ''Expectations for the Twenty-First Century:  An Overview of the New Limited Partnership Act'', 16 Probate &amp; Property 47, 48-49 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], limited partnerships are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. The UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]]) consulted in 2008 on proposals to modify and merge the Act with the Partnership Act 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |title=The Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009: Explanatory Document |publisher=UK Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform |date=June 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135622/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the proposals did not go ahead, and the 1907 Act remains the governing Act.

[[English law]] and [[Scottish law]] are distinct on partnerships. In English law, limited partnerships are not legally separate entities: the partners are jointly and severally liable and any lawsuits filed are filed against the partners by name. There has been discussion over whether limited partnerships operating under English law should be made separate legal entities in the same way as limited liability partnerships are. The [[Law Commission]] report on partnership law [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613041633/http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc283.pdf LC283] suggested that creation of separate legal personality should be left as an option for the partners to decide upon when a partnership is formed. There were concerns that automatically making partnerships separate legal entities would restrict their ability to trade in some European countries and also expose them to different tax regimes than expected.

===Japan===
[[Japanese law]] has historically provided for two business forms similar to limited partnerships:
* ''[[Goshi gaisha]]'', a form of close [[corporation]] (''[[mochibun kaisha]]'') with unlimited liability for certain shareholders
* ''[[Tokumei kumiai]]'' (lit. "anonymous partnerships"), a form of partnership in which non-operating partners have limited liability so long as they remain anonymous

In 1999, the [[Diet of Japan]] passed legislation enabling the formation of {{Nihongo|"limited partnerships for investment"|投資事業有限責任組合|''tōshi jigyō yūgen sekinin kumiai''}}. These are very similar to Anglo-American limited partnerships, in that they adopt most provisions of [[general partnership]] law but provide for limited liability for certain partners. Profits of an investment limited partnership pass through to all partners proportional to their investment share. For tax purposes, profits and losses will only pass through to the general partner(s) while the partnership has [[negative equity]] (i.e. liabilities exceeding assets); however, profits and losses while the partnership has positive equity are shared equally.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], Limited Partnerships are a form of partnership involving General Partners, (who are liable for all the debts and liabilities of the partnership) and Limited Partners (who are liable to the extent of their capital contribution to the partnership). The Limited Partnerships Act 2008 replaces Special Partnerships that exist under Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908. Special partnerships are considered obsolete as they do not provide the appropriate structure preferred by foreign venture capital investors.

Features of Limited Partnerships include:
* a list of activities that the limited partners can be involved in while not participating in the management of the Limited Partnership (safe harbour activities)
* an indefinite lifespan if desired
* separate legal personality
* tax treatment for Limited Partnerships.

The registers of Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are administered by the New Zealand [[Companies Office]]. Registration, maintenance and annual return filing for Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are conducted through manual forms.

===Germany===
'''Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien''' – abbreviated '''KGaA''' – is a [[Germany|German]] [[corporation|corporate]] designation standing for 'partnership limited by shares', a form of corporate organization roughly equivalent to a [[master limited partnership]]. A [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] auf Aktien has two types of participators. It has at least one partner with unlimited liability (Komplementär). It is in that sense a private company. Komplementärs are [[natural person]]s or [[legal person]]s. If the Komplementär is a corporation with limited liability then the type of the company has to be named as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung#Requirements of formation|UG (haftungsbeschränkt)]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[GmbH]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] &amp; Co. KGaA'' or ''[[Societas_Europaea|SE]] &amp; Co. KGaA''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sas.ac.uk/amicus/article/view/1229 The German Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien]. Amicus Curae. Accessed April 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Under consideration of the aspects of European freedom of establishment it is also possible that corporations established under foreign law can become Komplementärs of a KGaA forming companies like ''Limited &amp; Co. KGaA''.

The investment of the [[Partnership|partners]] with [[limited liability]] (Kommanditisten) is the stock of the company (Grundkapital) and divided into shares. A KGaA is in that aspect comparable with a German [[Aktiengesellschaft]].

The investment of all partners is the corporate's total capital (Gesamtkapital). The KGaA is a traditional type of very large [[family business]]es (that are partly publicly traded) in Germany; the consumer products giant [[Henkel]] and pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] are prominent examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5885211 |title=Company Overview of DORMA Holding GmbH + Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Merck, besides the owning family Merck also the members of the executive board are fully and privately liable for the company (including a period after withdrawal). Also the German football club [[Borussia Dortmund]] uses this corporate organization for its professional football team.

===Denmark===
A [[kommanditselskab]] (abbreviated K/S) is the Danish equivalent of the limited partnership. The owners are divided into general partners (komplementarer in Danish) and limited partners (kommanditister in Danish). Often the only general partner of a K/S is an Anpartsselskab with the least possible capital, thus reducing the liability of the K/S to the capital of the Anpartsselskab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7267">'''Management fad''' is a term used to characterize a change in philosophy or operations implemented by a business or institution.

The term is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and tends to be used in a [[pejorative]] sense, as it implies that such a change is being implemented (often '''''by''''' [[management]] '''''on''''' its [[employee]]s, with little or no input from them) solely because it is (at the time) "popular" within managerial circles, and not necessarily due to any real need for organizational change.  The term further implies that once the underlying philosophy is no longer "popular", it will be replaced by the newest "popular" idea, in the same manner and for the same reason as the previous idea.

Several authors have argued that new management ideas should be subject to greater critical analysis, and for the need for greater conceptual awareness of new ideas by managers.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. and Michael E. Raynor, "Why Hard-Nosed Executives Should Care About Management Theory," ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 81, No. 9, Sept. 2003, pp. 66-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors Leonard J. Ponzi and Michael Koenig believe that a key determinant of whether any management idea is a "management fad" is the number and timing of published articles on the idea.  In their research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://informationr.net/ir/8-1/paper145.html Ponzi, Leonard J. and Michael Koenig, "Knowledge Management: Another Management Fad?," ''Information Research'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Oct. 2002, paper no. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ponzi and Koenig argue that once an idea has been discussed for around 3–5 years, if after this time the number of articles on the idea in a given year decreases significantly (similar to the right-hand side of a bell curve), then the idea is most likely a "management fad".

==Common characteristics==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Management fads are often characterized by the following:
*New [[jargon]] for existing business processes.
*External [[consultants]] who specialize in the implementation of the fad.
*A ''[[certification]]'' or ''appraisal'' process performed by an external agency for a fee.
*Amending the [[job title]]s of existing employees to include references to the fad.
*Claims of a measurable business improvement via measurement of a [[metric system|metric]] (e.g. [[key performance indicator]]) that is defined by the fad itself.
*An internal sponsoring department or individual that gains influence due to the fad's implementation.
*Big words and complex phrases ([[puffery]]).

==Examples==
The following [[management theory|management theories]] and practices appeared on a list of management fashions and fads compiled by [[Adrian Furnham]],&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, Adrian, ''Management and Myths: Challenging Business Fads, Fallacies and Fashions'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, U.K., 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who arranged them in rough chronological order by their date of appearance, 1950s to 1990s:

*[[Management by objectives]]
*[[Matrix management]]
*[[Theory Z]]
*[[The One Minute Manager|One-minute management]]
*[[Management by wandering around]]
*[[Total quality management]]
*[[Business process reengineering]]
*[[Delayering]]
*[[Empowerment]]
*[[360-degree feedback]]
*[[Business process reengineering|Re-engineering]]
*[[Teamwork]]

Other theories and practices which observers have tagged as fads include:

* the tendency to replace every occurrence of "data" in compound managerial terminology with "information", see e.g. [[information integration]] vs. [[data integration]]

A '''meeting and convention planner''' supervises and coordinates the strategic, operational and logistical activities necessary for the production of [[convention (meeting)|events]]. The planner can be employed or hired ad hoc by [[corporation]]s, [[Voluntary association|association]]s, [[government]]s, and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventionindustry.org/glossary/seealso.asp?id=2488|title=CIC - Convention Industry Council|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.onetcenter.org/link/summary/13-1121.00|title=13-1121.00 - Meeting, Convention, and Event Planners|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardization issues==
* Although the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), sponsored by the [[United States Department of Labor]] and [[Employment and Training Administration]], identified this occupation as "meeting and convention planner," other titles are more commonly used. These titles include ''event planner'', ''meeting planner'', and ''meeting manager''. In addition, a number of other titles specific to the categories of events produced are used, such as ''corporate planner'' and ''party planner
* The ''[[banquet event order]]'' (BEO), a standard form used in the [[hospitality industry]] to document the requirements of an event as pertinent to the venue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventionindustry.org/glossary/seealso.asp?id=328|title=CIC - Convention Industry Council|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has presented numerous problems to meeting and convention planners due to the increasing complexity and scope of modern events. In response, [[Convention Industry Council]] developed the ''[[event specifications guide]]'' (ESG) that is currently replacing the BEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conventionindustry.org/Files/APEX/APEX_Event_Specifications_Guide.pdf Convention Industry Council: Event Specifications Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, the Convention Industry Council is spearheading [http://www.conventionindustry.org/apex/about.htm The Accepted Practices Exchange] (APEX). By bringing planners and suppliers together to create industry-wide accepted practices and a common terminology, the profession continues to enhance the professionalism of the meetings, conventions and exhibitions industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6538">In [[business]] or [[commerce]], an '''order''' is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer's point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a [[purchase order]]. From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a [[Sales Order|sales order]]. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a [[contract]] between the buyer and seller.

Within an organization, the term order may be used to refer to a [[work order]] for manufacturing, a [[preventive maintenance]] order, or an order to make repairs to a facility.

In many businesses, orders are used to collect and report [[cost]]s and [[revenue]]s according to well-defined purposes. Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.

==Spoken orders==
Businesses such as [[retail store]]s, [[restaurant]]s and [[filling station]]s conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer's actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a [[take-out]] or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one's tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an "[[implied in fact contract]]".

==Steps in commercial orders==
In commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.

There are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of "in writing" sometimes applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mallor |first=Jane P. |author2=A. James Barnes |author3=Thomas Bowers |author4=Michael J. Phillips |author5=Arlen W. Langvardt  |title=Business Law and the Regulatory Environment: Concepts and Cases |publisher=Irwin/McGraw-Hill |year=1998 |pages=175 |isbn=0-256-19716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concern for commercial orders is that there must be '''agreement''' (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a [[request for quotation]], request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Once an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Uniform Commercial Code==
In the US, Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2-106 describes the difference between a '''present sale''' (recorded as a sales order) and a '''sale''' (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "[[contract]]" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.  "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time.  A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401).  A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aggregate level of orders==
In their "Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services", the US Census Bureau publishes estimates of US retail and food services sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/svsd/www/retail.html Advance Monthly Sales For Retail And Food Services: Latest Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These "sales" are orders that have been filled; payment has been made or is an account receivable.
In their "Preliminary Report on Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders", the US Census Bureau publishes statistics for "new orders", shipments, "unfilled orders" and inventories for manufactured durable goods. This gives an indication whether trade is increasing or decreasing for manufactured durable goods in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/indicator/www/m3/index.htm Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, &amp; Orders (M3)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partner relationship management (PRM)''' is a system of methodologies, strategies, [[software]], and [[web-based]] capabilities that help a [[vendor]] to manage [[Business partner|partner relationships]]. The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svcawards.com/files/Forrester%20Wave%20PRM%20Q4%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sales-focused-partner-relationship-management-prm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/partner-relationship-management&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based PRM systems typically include a [[Content Management System]], a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a [[vendor]]'s sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries.

Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale.  Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.compubase.net/Partners-Resellers-ISVs-MSPs-Integrators-lists-for-business_a272.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf.  As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:
* [[Market development funds|MDF]] Request Programs
* Training, [[Certification]], and [[Accreditation]] Automation
* [[Qualified prospect|Deal]] Registration Programs
* Indirect [[Sales process|Sales Pipeline]] Reporting
* Joint [[Business Plan]]ning
* [[Bounty (reward)|Reward]] and [[Loyalty Program]]s
* [[Digital library|Content Library]]

==Trends==

Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Path Analysis Graphic.png|400px|thumb|A path analysis graph]] --&gt;
'''Path analysis''', is the analysis of a path, which is a portrayal of a chain of consecutive events that a given user or cohort performs during a set period of time while using a website, online game, or eCommerce platform. As a subset of [[behavioral analytics]], path analysis is a way to understand user behavior in order to gain actionable insights into the data. Path analysis provides a visual portrayal of every event a user or cohort performs as part of a path during a set period of time.

While it is possible to track a user’s path through the site, and even show that path as a visual representation, the real question is how to gain these actionable insights. If path analysis simply outputs a "pretty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thayer|first=Shelby|title=Why Do We Care About Path Analysis?|url=http://www.trendingupward.net/2008/09/ditch-path-analysis/|work=Trending Upward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  graph, while it may look nice, it does not provide anything concrete to act upon.

==Examples==
In order to get the most out of path analysis the first step would be to determine what needs to be analyzed and what are the goals of the analysis. A company might be trying to figure out why their site is running slow, are certain types of users interested in certain pages or products, or if their user interface is set up in a logical way.

Now that the goal has been set there are a few ways of performing the analysis. If a large percentage of a certain cohort, people between the ages of 18-25, logs into an online game, creates a profile and then spends the next 10 minutes wandering around the menu page, then it may be that the user interface is not logical. By seeing this group of users following the path that they did a developer will be able to analyze the data and realize that after creating a profile, the “play game” button does not appear. Thus, path analysis was able to provide actionable data for the company to act on and fix an error.

In eCommerce, path analysis can help customize a shopping experience to each user. By looking at what products other customers in a certain cohort looked at before buying one, a company can suggest “items you may also like” to the next customer and increase the chances of them making a purchase. Also, path analysis can help solve performance issues on a platform. For example, a company looks at a path and realizes that their site freezes up after a certain combinations of events. By analyzing the path and the progression of events that led to the error, the company can pinpoint the error and fix it.

==Evolution==

Historically path analysis fell under the broad category of [[website analytics]], and related only to the analysis of paths through websites. Path analysis in [[website analytics]] is a process of determining a sequence of pages visited in a visitor session prior to some desired event, such as the visitor purchasing an item or requesting a newsletter.  The precise order of pages visited may or may not be important and may or may not be specified.  In practice, this analysis is done in aggregate, ranking the paths (sequences of pages) visited prior to the desired event, by descending frequency of use.  The idea is to determine what features of the website encourage the desired result.  "Fallout analysis," a subset of path analysis, looks at "black holes" on the site, or paths that lead to a dead end most frequently, paths or features that confuse or lose potential customers.

With the advent of big data along with web-based applications, online games, and eCommerce platforms, path analysis has come to include much more than just web path analysis. Understanding how users move through an app, game, or other web platform are all part of modern-day path analysis.

== Understanding visitors ==
In the real world when you visit a shop the shelves and products are not placed in a random order. The shop owner carefully analyzes the visitors and path they walk through the shop, especially when they are selecting or buying products. Next the shop owner will reorder the shelves and products to optimize sales by putting everything in the most logical order for the visitors. In a supermarket this will typically result in the wine shelf next to a variety of cookies, chips, nuts, etc. Simply because people drink wine and eat nuts with it.

In most web sites there is a same logic that can be applied. Visitors who have questions about a product will go to the product information or support section of a web site. From there they make a logical step to the frequently asked questions page if they have a specific question. A web site owner also wants to analyze visitor behavior. For example, if a web site offers products for sale, the owner wants to convert as many visitors to a completed purchase. If there is a sign-up form with multiple pages, web site owners want to guide visitors to the final sign-up page.

Path analysis answers typical questions like: &lt;br /&gt;
''Where do most visitors go after they enter my home page?''&lt;br /&gt;
''Is there a strong visitor relation between product A and product B on my web site?''. &lt;br /&gt;
Questions that can't be answered by page hits and unique visitors statistics.

== Funnels and goals ==

Google Analytics provides a path function with funnels and goals. A predetermined path of web site pages is specified and every visitor walking the path is a goal. This approach is very helpful when analyzing how many visitors reach a certain destination page, called an end point analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis Tools|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/analysis-tools.html|publisher=Google Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using maps ==

The paths visitors walk in a web site can lead to an endless number of unique paths. As a result, there is no point in analyzing each path, but to look for the strongest paths. These strongest paths are typically shown in a graphical map or in text like: Page A --&gt; Page B --&gt; Page D --&gt; Exit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9486">In law, '''perfection''' relates to the additional steps required to be taken in relation to a [[security interest]] in order to make it effective against third parties&lt;ref&gt;See generally "Perfection of security interest," Black's Law Dictionary, pp. 1023-1023 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or to retain its effectiveness in the event of default by the grantor of the security interest.  Generally speaking, once a security interest is effectively created, it gives certain rights to the holder of the security and imposes duties on the party who grants that security.&lt;ref&gt;''Mace Builders v Lunn'' [1987] Ch 191&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in many legal systems, additional steps --- perfection of the security interest --- are required to enforce the security against third parties such as a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, section 395 of the Companies Act 1986 of the United Kingdom requires certain security interests to be filed at [[Companies House]] within 21 days of being created.  A failure to make such a filing does not affect the validity of the security interest between the debtor and the secured party, but if the debtor goes into insolvent liquidation, the security interest is [[void (law)|void]] against the liquidator.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

As a legal concept, perfection must be distinguished from:
*the ''grant'' or ''creation'' of the security interest, which creates its primary validity;
*''attachment'', which are steps that link the security interest to the underlying asset; and,
*''priority'', which is an ordering of competing security interests in same asset.

The same rule --- the [[common law]] [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']], for instance --- may govern both perfection against third parties (e.g., subsequent security holders) and prioritization of competing security interests.

In most legal systems, the need for perfection arises only in relation to security interests that are proprietary in nature (such as a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[equitable charge]]).  Other arrangements which constitute security in the loose sense of the word --- for instance, [[retention of title clause|title retention arrangements]], [[hire purchase]], and [[lease|leasing transactions]] --- need not in general be perfected in the legal sense.

In India, Section 125 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that certain charges shall be void against liquidator or creditors unless registered. Thus,if a charge is not registered with Registrar of Companies, and company happens to go for liquidation, even secured creditor shall be treated as unsecured.

==Types of perfection==

There are three principal modes by which a security interest may be perfected (which method of perfection is applicable depends upon the nature of the security interest and the laws of the relevant country).

# possession of the [[collateral (finance)|collateral]];
# statutory registration or filing;&lt;ref&gt;Such as the filing under section 395 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1986 referred to above&lt;/ref&gt; and
# notice to the debtor or a fundholder.

===Possession===

Some security interests can be perfected only by the actual possession of the asset.  For example, under a  common-law [[Pledge (law)|pledge]] (or pawn), the right to enforce the sale of the asset is contingent upon the possession of that asset: an agreement that leaves the debtor in possession of the pledged collateral does not give rise to an enforceable security interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Dublin City Distilery Co Ltd v Doherty'' [1914] AC 823&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, the possession does not need to be ''actual'' possession, but may be ''constructive'' possession.  For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods.&lt;ref&gt;Although see ''Official Assignee of Madras v Mercantile Bank of India'' [1935] AC 53 where Lord Wright inferred that this may not be the case, discussed and explained in other terms in ''Commercial Law'' by [[Roy Goode]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by [[attornment]].

The law relating to perfection of security interests by taking of possession can sometimes be confused with the law relating to the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually documents of title) can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent example an equitable mortgage created this way in Australia, see {{cite AustLII|HCA|45|2005|litigants=Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd |courtname=auto |parralelcite=(2005) 221 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 612 |date=1 September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration or filing===

Certain security interests may be perfected by some kind of registration or filing.  Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is more accurate to speak of registration as the lodgment of particulars, and filing as the lodgment of the security instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit (Cmnd. 4596, 1971), para 5.7.13; the distinction does have some meaning, as registration of particulars only makes third parties aware that there is a security interest, whereas filing they can see the terms of the security interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally systems of registration divide into two types:
# registration against a particular debtor; and
# registration against a particular asset.
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Registration against a particular asset only tends to be practical where the assets are of a nature and substance that makes it feasible to have a register for recording security interests against them.  Most countries have systems for the registration of security relating to land, aircraft, ships and intellectual property rights.  The advantage of a register relating to the asset is that if the debtor wishes to provide an asset as collateral, the proposed lender can swiftly check definitively whether the asset is encumbered or not. Nevertheless, specialist registers in some jurisdictions cannot always be considered "a one-stop source of information".&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the uncertainties surrounding Intellectual property registers in the UK see Andrea Tosato, Security interests over intellectual property  (2011) Journal of intellectual property law and Practice 99 [http://jiplp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/2/93.short?rss=1][http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073301]&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration against a debtor tends to operate by way of requiring the registration of certain security interests by the debtor.  The advantage is that a lender can quickly see which assets of the debtor are encumbered and which are not.  However, because many registration systems do not require all types of security interest to be registered gaps can remain.  Also, systems which register security against the debtor do not act as a check that the debtor actually has title to any of the relevant assets, merely that he has not created any security interest over them.&lt;ref&gt;A lender can still be in difficulty if it transpires that the goods are subject to a lease, or retention of title arrangement, or other form of non-registrable arrangement.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the position is complicated by the fact that many legal systems employ both, interchangeably.  A security interest granted by a debtor over a particular asset in any given country may need to be registered against the debtor, against the asset, both or neither.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] if a [[company (law)|company]] was to grant a mortgage over land and its rental income, this would be registrable both against the company (under section 395 of the Companies Act) and the asset (under the Land Registration Act and/or the Land Charges Act), but the same company granting a fixed equitable charge over a car would not be required to register it anywhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notice ===

In some legal systems, perfection of a security interest requires notice to be given to a relevant third party.  This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other ''[[Chose (English law)|chose in action]]'', notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund.  Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].  Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an [[equitable charge]] over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X.  The controversy in the rule relates to the fact that it is also a rule of ''priority'', meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted.

Similarly, in many common law legal systems, where there is an [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of a debt, the assignee cannot enforce the rights of the assigning creditor against the debtor unless notice of the assignment has been given, and until notice of the assignment has been given, the debtor can still discharge the debt by paying the money to the creditor, notwithstanding the assignment.

A '''performance supervision system''' ('''PSS''') is a [[software system]] used to improve the performance of a [[Industrial process|process]] [[Factory|plant]].  Typical process plants include [[oil refineries]], [[paper mills]], and [[chemical plant]]s.

The PSS gathers real-time data from the [[process control]] system, typically a [[distributed control system]].  Using this data, the PSS can calculate performance [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for process equipment, controls, and operations.

The '''President''' is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group. The relationship between the president and the [[Chief Executive Officer]] varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similar vein to the [[Chief Operating Officer]], the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[Corporate_title#Senior_management|C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and Chief Executive Officer" or "President and Chief Operating Officer") is also loosely defined; the President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various [[Vice_president#In_business|Vice Presidents]] (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of the president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws (e.g. the president can make an "executive decision" only if the bylaws allow for it).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 456|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term "president" was used to designate someone who presided over a meeting, and was used in the same way that "foreman" or "overseer" is used now (the term is still used in that sense today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='President' Once Meant Little More Than 'Foreman'|author=Guy Raz|date=December 14, 2013|work=npr.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=250990126|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/president?s=t|title = President|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = |publisher = Dictionary.com|quote = a person who presides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now also come to mean "chief officer" in terms of administrative or executive duties.

== Duties at meetings ==
[[File:AGM Annual General Meeting of a typical small (141 member) volunteer organisation.jpg|thumb|President presiding over the AGM of a small volunteer organization. President sitting at the left of table in the background]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the president has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:
* calling the meeting to order
* determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
* [[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* enforcing the rules of the group
* putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* adjourning the meeting
While presiding, the president should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the president votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the president should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the president only has one vote (i.e. the president cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the president such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and authority ==
The powers of the president vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the president has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the president only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the president has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the president depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplinary procedures ==
If the president exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the president may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the president has the power to discipline this officer.

== President-Elect ==
{{See also|-elect}}Some organizations may have a position of President-Elect in addition to the position of President. Generally the membership of the organization elects a President-Elect and when the term of the President-Elect is complete, that person automatically becomes President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate Past President ==
Some organizations may have a position of Immediate Past President in addition to the position of President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Immediate Past President? - Association of Information Technology Professionals|url = https://www.aitp.org/news/123604/|website = www.aitp.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-Elect/President/Immediate Past President|url = http://www.asha.org/About/governance/BOD/President/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-elect, President or Immediate Past President Position Description|url = http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/leadership/nominations-and-elections/national-leadership-positions/president-elect-or-president-position-description|website = www.eatrightpro.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those organizations, when the term of the President is complete, that person automatically fills the position of Immediate Past President. The organization can have such a position only if the bylaws provide it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of such a position would also have to be provided in the bylaws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''professional conference organiser''', '''professional congress organiser''' ('''PCO''') or '''conference company''' is a company which specialises in the organisation and management of congresses, conferences, seminars and similar events.

==Role==
PCOs can typically work as consultants for academic and professional associations. They usually provide full service management for conferences including conference design, [[abstract_management|abstract management software]], program development, registration, site and venue selection and booking, audiovisuals, IT support, logistics, leisure management, marketing, printing and web services, sourcing speakers, funding,  sponsorship and exhibitor sales, financial management and budget control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKDnKFv3v0YC&amp;pg=PT322&amp;lpg=PT322&amp;dq=pco+conferences&amp;source=web&amp;ots=44eHJG8Ei5&amp;sig=ZQTKIwLhEwzOlMiEjG8Fx2b0y-4#PPT321,M1 Conferences and Conventions: A Global Industry By Tony Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies offer related services including travel agents and public relations companies. They tend to focus on limited areas such as destination management.

==Size of market sector==
Recent surveys of UK conference venues have found that a third of conference bookings were made by PCOs or venue-finding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC Information drawn from the British Conference Venues Survey 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100649/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf Survey of Conferences in Scotland in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070507/http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html Paid report in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (first part free)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207013830/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 UK-based conferences generated £7.6 billion in direct sales giving PCOs a central role in some £2.5 billion of revenue generation. The UK is ranked second behind the US for global market share of conferences. Thus, although there is no one source of global statistics for the conference market it appears that PCOs play a central role in several billion dollars' worth of revenue generation worldwide.

The '''profit impact of market strategy''' ('''PIMS''') database "yields solid evidence in support of both common sense and counter-intuitive principles for gaining and sustaining competitive advantage": Tom Peters and Nancy Austin. It was developed with the intention of providing [[empirical evidence]] of which [[business strategy|business strategies]] lead to success, across different industries. Data from the study is used to craft strategies in [[strategic management]] and [[marketing strategies|marketing strategy]]. The study identified several strategic variables that typically influence profitability. Some of the most important strategic variables studied were market share, product quality, investment intensity, and service quality, (all of which were found to be highly correlated with profitability).

According to Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford (''Essentials of Marketing'', 4th edition, McGraw Hill), PIMS seeks to address three basic questions:

* What is the typical profit rate for each type of business?
* Given current strategies in a company, what are the future operating results likely to be?
* What strategies are likely to help improve future operating results?

Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (Marketing Concepts and Strategies, 4th European edition, Houghton Mifflin) cite six principal areas of information that PIMS holds on each business:

* characteristics of the business environment
* competitive position of the business
* structure of the production process
* how the budget is allocated
* strategic movement
* operating results.

== Brief history of PIMS ==

The PIMS project was started by [[Sidney Schoeffler]] working at [[General Electric]] in the 1960s, managed by the [[Marketing Science Institute]] in the early 1970s, and has been administered by the [[American Strategic Planning Institute]] since 1975.

It was initiated by senior managers at GE who wanted to know why some of their business units were more profitable than the others. With the help of Sidney Schoeffler they set up a research project in which each of their strategic business units reported their performance on dozens of variables. This was then expanded to outside companies in the early 1970s.

The initial survey, between 1970 and 1983, involved 2,600 [[strategic business unit]]s (SBU), from 200 companies. Today 12,500 observations exist for 4162 SBU's; PIMS is managed by PIMS Associates in London. Each SBU give information on the market within which they operated, the products they had brought to market and the efficacy of the strategies they had implemented.

The PIMS project analysed the data they had gathered to identify the options, problems, resources and opportunities faced by each SBU. Based on the spread of each business across different industries, it was hoped that the data could be drawn upon to provide other business, in the same industry, with empirical evidence of which strategies lead to increased profitability. The database continues to be updated and drawn upon by academics and companies today.

== Conclusions drawn by PIMS ==

The original PIMS data survey led the PIMS project to identify 37 variables which account for the majority of business success. Two leading marketing texts differ slightly on which variables are the most important, with Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (p676) identifying:

* a strong market position
* high quality of product
* lower costs
* lower requirement for capital investment

and Lanacaster, Massingham and Ashford (p535) citing:

* market share
* image
* investment intensity
* market growth
* life cycle stage
* marketing expense to sales ratio.

While many of these seem obvious, PIMS has the advantage of providing empirical data that define quantitative relationships and back what some may consider to be common-sense.

== Participation in the PIMS study: cost and benefits ==

PIMS evaluated businesses' market position and suggest possible strategies, based on the data gathered from participating companies. Businesses wishing to use the service provide detailed information, including details of their:

* competitors and market
* balance sheet

In return, PIMS provides four reports, described by Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford as:

1. A 'Par' report - showing the ROI and cash flows that are 'normal' for this type of business, given its market, competition, technology, and cost structure. 

2. A 'Strategy Analysis' report, which computes the predicted consequences of each of several alternative strategic actions, judged by information in similar businesses making similar moves, from a similar starting-point and in a similar business environment.

3. A 'Report on Look-Alikes' (ROLA), which aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, by analyzing strategically similar business more closely.

4. An 'Optimum Strategy' report, which is aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, again based on the experiences of other businesses in 'similar' circumstances.

== A critique of PIMS ==

Clearly, it could be argued that a database operating on information gathered in the period 1970 - 1983 is outdated. However data continues to be collected from participating companies and PIMS argues that it provides a unique source of time-series data, the conclusions from which have proven to be very stable over time.

It has also been suggested that PIMS is too heavily biased towards traditional, metal-bashing industries, such as [[car manufacturing]]; perhaps not surprising, considering the era in which the majority of the surveys were carried out. In reality, as of 2006, the 3,800+ businesses contained within the database includes data from the consumer, industrial and service sectors.

It is also heavily weighted towards large companies, at the expense of small entrepreneurial firms. This resulted from the data collection method used. Generally only larger firms are prepared to pay the consulting fee, provide the survey data, and in return have access to the database in which they can compare their business with other large businesses or SBUs. [[Mintzberg]] (1998) claims that because the database is dominated by large established firms, it is more suitable as a technique for assessing the state of "being there rather than getting there". (page 99)  This criticism is very important because if one is trying to get "average" results across industries to give us the "laws of the marketplace", a dubious enterprise as it is, the sampling strategy is important if one wants to obtain results that are representative.

The most important criticism leveled at PIMS is the fact that causation implies correlation but correlation does not imply causation.  One of the most important "findings" of the PIMS program was to find a statistically significant relationship between profitability and market share (see Buzzell and Gale (1987)).  The empirical work conducted by PIMS suggested that high market share yielded high profitability, but this correlation cannot be considered a "true" causal relationship because of the fact that correlation does not imply causation.  In the multivariate correlation analysis, high market share was  associated with high profits, but high profits could have been associated with high market share, or a third factor common to both could have caused the correlation.  Many analysts believe that it is possible to use a statistical causality test to determine causation, but if the whole problem is that correlation is insufficient to determine causation in the first place, then how can using another correlation, which is what is used in the tests, determine causation.

Another important criticism of PIMS is that it does not take into account heterogeneity in the data set.  The presumption of PIMS analysis is that the same "laws of the marketplace" apply to all industries.  However, the statistical assumptions employed in the econometric analysis make the assumption that all cross-sectional observations come from one statistical distribution that is the same for all cross-sectional observations.  This tends to be the Achilles heel of virtually all cross-sectional analyses.  If this homogeneous assumption is false, then cross-sectional observations are being drawn from different populations.  While one can use estimation techniques such as fixed-effects to control for different population means, co-variances can also differ across populations (meaning behavior differs across populations) and the only way one can control for this aspect is to run regressions on each population separately.  This means that the "laws of the marketplace" differ across populations, directly contradicting one of the main presumptions of using the PIMS data base for analysis.

Tellis and Golder (1996) claim that PIMS defines markets too narrowly. Respondents described their market very narrowly to give the appearance of high market share. They believe that this self reporting bias makes the conclusions suspect. They are also concerned that no defunct companies were included, leading to "survivor bias".

      <comment>/* Origins and background */ I do not thinl you can say that scholars "generally" hold that Penrose made a substantive contribution; two scholars have advanced this view, but the reality is that such a view is widely dismissed by scholars more generally; an article about RBV is simply not the place to debate Penrose's contributions to management theory; editors who want to do so should put their comments on Penrose's article directly</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18683">The '''resource-based view''' ('''RBV''') is a managerial framework used to determine the strategic resources with the potential to deliver comparative advantage to a firm. These resources can be exploited by the firm in order to achieve sustainable [[competitive advantage]].

Barney's 1991 article "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" is widely cited as a pivotal work in the emergence of the resource-based view. However, some scholars argue that there was evidence for a fragmentary resource-based theory from the 1930s. RBV proposes that firms are heterogeneous because they possess heterogeneous resources, meaning firms can have different strategies because they have different resource mixes.

The RBV focuses managerial attention on the firm's internal resources in an effort to identify those assets, capabilities and competencies with the potential to deliver superior competitive advantages.

==Origins and background==

During the 1990s, the ''resource-based view'' (also known as the ''resource-advantage theory'') of the firm became the dominant paradigm in strategic planning. RBV  can be seen as a reaction against the positioning school and its somewhat prescriptive approach which focused managerial attention on external considerations, notably [[Porter's five forces analysis|industry structure]]. The so-called positioning school had dominated the discipline throughout the 1980s. In contrast, the emergent resource-based view argued that the source of sustainable advantage derives from doing things in a superior manner; by developing superior capabilities and resources. [[Jay Barney]]'s article, "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" (1991), is seen as pivotal in the emergence of the resource-based view.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prahalad | first1 = C. K. | last2 = Hamel | first2 = G. | year = | title = The Core Competence of the Corporation | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 79–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of scholars point out that a fragmentary resource-based perspective was evident from the 1930s, noting that Barney was heavily influenced by Wernerfelt's earlier work which introduced the idea of resource position barriers being roughly analogous to entry barriers in the positioning school.&lt;ref name="priem1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based 'View' a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 20–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Pandian | first2 = J.R. | year = | title = The Resource-Based View Within the Conversation of Strategic Management | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 363–380 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250130505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that the resource-based view represents a new paradigm, albeit with roots in "Ricardian and Penrosian economic theories according to which firms can earn sustainable supranormal returns if, and only if, they have superior resources and those resources are protected by some form of isolating mechanism precluding their diffusion throughout the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, A. and Kipley, D., "Resource-Based View," in: Matthew R. Marvel (ed), ''Encyclopedia of New Venture Management,'' Sage Publications, 2012, p. 397, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452218571.n158 &lt;/ref&gt;  While its exact influence is debated, Edith Penrose's 1959 book ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' is held by two scholars of strategy to state many concepts that would later influence the modern, resource-based theory of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Penrose's (1959) "Contributions to the Resource-based View of Strategic Management", Yasemin Y. Kor and Joseph T. Mahoney, ''Journal of  Management Studies'' 41:1 January 2004 0022-2380 http://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/Publications/jms_kor%20and%20mahoney%20(2004).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBV is an interdisciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The resource-based view is interdisciplinary in that it was developed within the disciplines of economics, ethics, law, management, marketing, supply chain management and general business.&lt;ref&gt; Hunt, S.D., "A General Theory of Business Marketing: R-A theory, Alderson, the ISBM Framework and the IMP Theoretical Structure," ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 41, 2013, pp 283-293&lt;/ref&gt; 

RBV focuses attention on an organisation's internal resources as a means of organising processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and not substitutable (now generally known as ''VRIN'' criteria).&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view suggests that organisations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"/&gt;

Although the literature presents many different ideas around the concept of the resource-advantage perspective, at its heart, the common theme is that the firm's resources are financial, legal, human, organisational, informational and relational; resources are heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile and that management's key task is to understand and organise resources for sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, pp 387-401; Hunt, D. S. and Derozier, C., "The Normative Imperatives of Business and Marketing Strategy: Grounding Strategy in Resource-Advantage View," ''Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,'' Vol. 19, No. 1, 2004, pp. 5–22&lt;/ref&gt; Key theorists who have contributed to the development of a coherent body of literature include [[Jay Barney|Jay B. Barney]], [[George S. Day]], [[Gary Hamel]], [[Shelby D. Hunt]], G. Hooley and [[C.K. Prahalad]].

== Concept ==

Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage lies at the heart of much of the literature in both strategic management and strategic marketing.&lt;ref name="fahy1"&gt;Fahy, J and Smithee, A. "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999, 10, online at http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf or https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/025b/5aa7e682f4cbf1d7637a0bbe51a2a0d602e7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view offers strategists a means of evaluating potential factors that can be deployed to confer a competitive edge. A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance, nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, R., "The Nature of Operations Strategy: Combining Strategic Decisions from an Operations and Market based Perspective," ''Management Decision,'' Vol. 41, No, 6, pp.  538–49&lt;/ref&gt; Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 108–09; Barney uses the term "causally ambiguous" which he describes as a situation when "the link between the resources controlled by the firm and the firm's sustained competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organisational learning to develop, nurture and maintain key resources and competencies.

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Wensley | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Assessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive Superiority | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.2307/1251261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G. S. | year = 1994 | title = The Capabilities of Market-Driven Organizations | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 37–52 | doi=10.2307/1251915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooley | first1 = G.

The key managerial tasks are:

1)   Identify the firm’s potential key resources.

2)   Evaluate whether these resources fulfill the following criteria (also known as ''VRIN'' criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C. K. and Hamel, G., "The Core Competence of the Corporation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 79–91; Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt;

* Valuable - they enable a firm to implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
* Rare - not available to other competitors.
* Imperfectly imitable - not easily implemented by others.
* Non-substitutable - not able to be replaced by some other non-rare resource.

3) Develop, nurture and protect resources that pass these evaluations.

== Definitions ==

Given the centrality of resources in terms of conferring competitive advantage, the management and marketing literature carefully defines and classifies resources and capabilities.

=== Resources ===

Barney  defines firm resources as: "all [[assets]], capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a firm that enable the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 101 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Capabilities===

Capabilities are “a special type of resource, specifically an organizationally embedded non-transferable firm-specific resource whose purpose is to improve the productivity of the other resources possessed by the firm.” &lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, No. 5, pp. 387–401 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive advantage===

Barney defined a [[competitive advantage]] as "when [a firm] is able to implement a “value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 102 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of resources and capabilities===

Firm-based resources may be tangible or intangible.

: ''Tangible resources'' include: physical assets such as financial resources and human resources including real estate, raw materials machinery, plant, inventory, brands, patents and trademarks and cash.&lt;ref&gt;Andriessen, D., ''Making Sense of Intellectual Capital: Designing a Method  for the Valuation of Intangibles,''  Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, Burlington, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Intangible resources'' may be embedded in organisational routines or practices such as an organization's reputation, culture, knowledge or know-how, accumulated experience, relationships with customers,  suppliers or other key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Lev, B., ''Intangibles:    Management,  Measurement, and Reporting,'' Brookings Institution Press, Washington,, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==RBV and strategy formulation==

Firms in possession of a resource, or mix of resources that are rare among competitors, are said to have a ''comparative advantage.'' This comparative advantage enables firms to produce marketing offerings that are either (a) perceived as having superior value or (b) can be produced at lower costs. Therefore, a comparative advantage in resources can lead to a competitive advantage in market position.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, S.D. and Morgan, R.M., "The Comparative Advantage of the Firm," ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 59, April, 1995, pp 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation. Hooley et al. suggest the following classification of competitive positions:&lt;ref&gt;Hooley, G., Broderick, A. and Moller, K., "Competitive Positioning and the Resource-Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of Strategic Marketing,'' Vol. 6, 1998, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Quality positioning
:* Innovation positioning
:* Service positioning
:* Benefit positioning
:* Tailored positioning (one-to-one marketing)

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of RBV have been widely cited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 41–56 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are as follows:

* The RBV is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collis | first1 = D. J. | year = | title = Research Note: How Valuable Are Organizational Capabilities? | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 1994 | issue = | pages = 143–152 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250150910}}; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Tautology in the Resource-Based View and Implications of Externally Determined Resource Value: Further Comments | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 57–66 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different resource configurations can generate the same value for firms and thus would not be competitive advantage {{cn|date=January 2018}}
* The role of product markets is underdeveloped in the argument &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based Theory a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 22–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory has limited prescriptive implications.&lt;ref name="priem1"/&gt;

Other criticisms include:

* The failure to consider factors surrounding resources; that is, an assumption that they simply exist, rather than a critical investigation of how key capabilities are acquired or developed.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, A.L., "On Equilibrium, Organizational Form, and Competitive Strategy, in Joel A.C. Baum, Frank Dobbin (eds), ''Economics Meets Sociology in Strategic Management (Advances in Strategic Management),'' Volume 17, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp 271 - 284&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is perhaps difficult (if not impossible) to find a resource which satisfies all of Barney's VRIN criteria.
* An assumption that a firm can be profitable in a highly competitive market as long as it can exploit advantageous resources does not always hold true. It ignores external factors concerning the industry as a whole; [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure Analysis]] ought also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelt, R. P., "How Much does Industry Matter?" ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 12, No. 3, 1991, pp. 167-185&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12317">'''Sales outsourcing''' is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. 

== Background ==
Full 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party [[sales]] force. It is differentiated from [[Value-added re seller|value added reselling]] or [[Distributor (business)|distribution]] in that the [[business model]] can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired [[direct sales]] force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. 
Other names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trickle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full sales outsourcing is different from [[telemarketing]] in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, [[marketing]], tools systems and methodologies as well as [[sales management]].

Sales [[outsourcing]] firms provide [[accountability]] regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service [[training]] support from the client.

== Purpose of indirect sales ==
The sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products.  Sales outsourcing providers include [[manufacturers' representative]]s, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with [[wikt:function|functionality]] and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.

Sales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novick|first=H. J.|title=Selling through independent reps|year=2000|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing [[revenue]] or providing speed of response or flexibility.

The [[business case]] for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract.  Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krafft|first=M |author2=Albers, S. |author3=Lal, R.|title=Relative Explanatory Power of Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Analysis in German Salesforces|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|year=2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate "distractions" that do not occur with external resources.

Companies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[pejorative]] term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=A M |author2=Anderson E |author3=MacInnis D J|title=Reputation Management as a Motivation for Sales Structure Decisions|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1999|volume=63|pages=74–89|doi=10.2307/1251975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.

A recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downey|first=J. M.|title=Risks of outsourcing - applying risk management to staffing methods|journal=Facilities|year=1995|volume=13|series=9/10|pages=38–44|doi=10.1108/02632779510095617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see [[Lean startup#Philosophy|Lean startup]]). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.

Contract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=Contract sales organizations (CSOs): making the transition from tactical resource to strategic partnering|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2008|volume=8|series=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jmm.5050119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salespartnerships.com/resources/articles/contract-pharmaceutical-sales-pharma-landscape|title=Contract Pharmaceutical Sales: The Changing Pharma Landscape|date=2017-09-06|work=Sales Partnerships|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poulter|first=Julian|title=Selling People Ltd|newspaper=Sales outsourcing alternatives|date=2005-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales outsourcing can also be used as a [[market entry strategy]] and avoids [[permanent establishment]] risk.

==Indirect sales growth rate==
The experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the [[electronics]], [[communications]] and [[high tech]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=What is a Master Agent?|url=http://www.telarus.com/why-telarus.php|publisher=Telecom Channel News|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.

'''Sustainopreneurship''' (entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability) is a concept that has emerged from the earlier concepts [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[ecopreneurship]], via sustainability entrepreneurship. The concept means to use creative business organizing to solve problems related to sustainability to create social and environmental sustainability as a [[strategic objective]] and purpose, at the same time respecting the boundaries set in order to maintain the life support systems in the process. In other words, it is a "business with a cause" – where the [[global issues|world problems]] are turned into [[business opportunities]] by deployment of sustainability innovations. 

==Definition==

The definition first introduced in a conference article in 2006:&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. in Science Sustainable Development – Starting Points and Critical Reflections, Uppsala: VHU – Föreningen Vetenskap för Hållbar Utveckling (Swedish Society for Sustainable Development), pp. 21-30. {{ISBN|91-631-9222-5}}. [http://www.vhu.se/site/The-Swedish-Research-Association-for-Sustainable-Development.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deployment of sustainability innovations: Entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability. 
# Short for sustainability intra-/entrepreneurship. 
# To focus on one or more (world/social/sustainability-related) problem(s), find/identify and/or invent a solution to the problem(s) and bring the innovation to the market by creating an efficient organization. With the (new alt. deep transformation of an old) mission/cause-oriented sustainability business adding ecological/economical/social values and gains, with a bias towards the intangible – through dematerialization/resocialization. The value added at the same time preserving, restoring and/or ultimately enhancing the underlying utilized capital stock, in order to maintain the capacity to fulfil the needs of present and coming generations of stakeholders.

==Conceptual development==

The business world has been nominated as a premier force for creating a sustainable world,&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Hart, S. L. (2005) Capitalism at the Crossroads: the Unlimited Business Opportunities in Solving the World's Most Difficult Problems. Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing., p 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Prahalad, C. K. (2004) The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid – Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when acting as a source of innovation and creativity – e. g. as Robinson (2004:378)&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;Robinson, J. (2004)'' ''Squaring the Circle? Some thoughts on the idea of Sustainable Development, ''Ecological Economics,'' 48:4, pp. 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it:

:''"In addition to integrating across fields, sustainability must also be integrated across sectors or interests. It is clear that governments alone have neither the will nor the capability to accomplish sustainability on their own. The private sector, as the chief engine of economic activity on the planet, and '''a major source for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship,''' must be involved in trying to achieve sustainability."'' 

Sustainopreneurship is a candidate to be the accentuating factor to give even more leverage to forces emerging from world of business activities to contribute to sustainability. The concept of sustainopreneurship was first introduced as a term in 2000&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;Schaltegger, S. (2000) Vom Bionier zum Sustainopreneur, Presentation at Rio Impuls Management Forum 2000, Home Page of conference {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001904/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, presentation accessible at {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707002241/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; where it was predominantly related to the proactive change management approaches associated with process adjustment with increased respect to the environment. The phenomenon developed with publications in 2003,&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;Hockerts, K. (2003) Sustainability Innovation: Ecological and Social Entrepreneurship and the Managing of Antagonistic Assets'', ''PhD Dissertation, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003a) Sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, Centre for Sustainability Management, University of Lueneburg, Conference Proceedings of Conference Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management 2003 in Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003b) Innovativität und Sustainability Intrapreneurship,'' ''Paper presented at Sustainable Management in Action '03, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt; and further evolved and was tentatively defined in 2006 by Anders Abrahamsson.&lt;ref name="ftn8"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This tentative definition was empirically tested in his Master thesis,&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007a) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause: Conceptualizing Entrepreneurship for Sustainability. [Master Thesis in Business Administration.] Växjö: Reports from Växjö University: Business administration and economics. http://www.diva-portal.org/vxu/abstract.xsql?dbid=1254, (accessed 2007-05-25).&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the enactive research process&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the definition stood the test contrasting it towards the auto-ethnographical empirical material. A paper to identify future research challenges was made beyond this in 2007,&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further with a book chapter published in September 2008.&lt;ref name="ftn13"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2008), Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. The Promise of Creative Organizing for Sustainability. In "Bridging the Functional and Territorial Views on Regional Entrepreneurship and Development", eds. Bengt Johannisson and Åsa Lindholm-Dahlstrand. Örebro: FSF (Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research). {{ISBN|91-89301-27-7}}. [http://www.fsf.se/publikation/lista/2008_6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the entrepreneurial discourse has opened up to move beyond a strictly economic phenomenon, rather than being perceived primarily as a social process at large.&lt;ref name="ftn17"&gt;Steyaert, C., Katz, J. (2004) Reclaiming the space of entrepreneurship in society: geographical, discursive and social dimensions, Entrepreneurship and Business Development 2004:3, pp. 179-196, special issue on Social Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the conceptual formation were two traces of social entrepreneurship and eco-preneurship, dealing primarily with the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. Primary associations with [[social entrepreneurship]] have also been establishing not-for-profit venturing and charities to innovatively address and solve social problems, whereas [[ecopreneurship]] has been primarily focused on solving environmental problems.&lt;ref name="ftn7"/&gt; See [[Principles of ecopreneurship]].

Both these traces of conceptual development are taken beyond, merge and integrate into the suggested conceptual construct at hand, where distinctions are made from both of these concepts – sustainopreneurial processes taking place institutionally through for-profit organizing, but not with profit as its main driving force. Sustainopreneurial venturing is done in a holistic manner that meets both ecological and social challenges simultaneously with regard to both purpose and process. 

=== Three main dimensions ===

The definition of sustainopreneurship needs to be highlighted by three distinguishing dimensions with all three being simultaneously present in the applied (inter)action it reflects. The first is oriented towards "why" – its purpose and motive. The second and third are reflecting two "how"-related dimensions – its process. 

'''1. Sustainopreneurship consciously sets out to find and/or create innovations to solve sustainability-related problems'''

:The conscious mission that guides the action, especially in the nascent '-preneurial' stage before venturing forms and formalizes into an institutionalized business entity, is to deliberately find practical and innovative solutions to problems related to the sustainability agenda. This is the main key to distinguish this category of entrepreneurial activity and behaviour labelled sustainopreneurship from generic entrepreneurial activity: the cause-oriented intention that places the core motive, purpose and driving-force of the business activities. To identify and further grasp what is meant by sustainability problems, central sources in the global sustainable development discourse are identified, which guide us to what is meant practically and operationally by ''sustainability in action.'' The outcome of diverse sources are summarized in this list of ''"sustainability-related problems",'' determined by the political action plan documented in ''Agenda 21'',&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;''UN, Conference on Environment and Development (1992a) Main Documents, download page, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/docs_unced.htm; including Agenda 21, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Millennium Declaration'' defining the ''[[Millennium Development Goals]],&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;''UN, Millennium Development Goals (2000) Homepage, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; both agreed at the ''Millennium Summit'' in New York 2000, and the ''WSSD Plan of Implementation'' decided upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;UN, World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002b) Homepage, http://www.johannesburgsummit.org, with WSSD Plan of Implementation, TOC with access to the full document, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; This list, derived and synthesized from these sources, lines up areas with associated problems to solve, goals to reach and values to create:

* [[Poverty]]
* [[Water and sanitation]]
* [[Public health|Health]]
* Education/[[illiteracy]]
* [[Sustainable production]] and consumption patterns
*  [[climate and energy|Climate change and energy systems]]
* Chemicals
* [[Urbanization]]
* Ecosystems, [[biological diversity]] and [[land use]]
* Utilization of sea resources
* Food and agriculture
* [[Trade justice]]
* [[Social stability]], democracy and good governance
* [[Peace]] and security


'''2. Sustainopreneurship means to get solutions to the market through creative organizing''' 

:The line-up above could make one easily depressed. But, a fundamental attitude to acquire and maintain when this list of sustainability-related problems is compiled and then considered is to avoid falling into disempowerment and despair. It is of core importance to take the agenda as entrepreneurial ''challenges'' – to view problems as ''possibilities'', obstacles as ''opportunities'', and resistance as a ''resource'', whatever the nature of the resistance. If the solution is generated by creativity, it is equally important to take it to the market in a creative and innovative way. In this dimension there is nothing that really differs from the generic entrepreneurial description I subscribe to, but this comes natural since sustainopreneurship is a conceptual extension and development from the social phenomenon named entrepreneurship, and thus inherits one of its perceived key dimensions, 'entrepreneurship as creative organizing'.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The market is used as well, not society primarily, since it implies business establishment – a sustainability business that still knows its place and role in the holarchy mentioned earlier. Bringing something to the market at the same time brings it to society and our shared physical environment.

'''3. Sustainopreneurship in process adds sustainability value with respect for life support systems '''

:The awareness that the (economic) market is an embedded sub-system in the "socio-sphere" that is in turn a part of the 'bio-sphere' is made explicit. This awareness naturally and self-evidently makes the sustainopreneurial team maximize harmony with life support systems in the process. With joy and pride the epitome of the generic definition of "sustainable development" lives in business venturing. In short – living the generic definition of sustainable development as defined by WCED,&lt;ref name="ftn18"&gt;UN, World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) Our Common Future, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to the needs of present and future stakeholders, keeping the holistic world-view and making it guide everyday (inter)action. 

===Sustainable vs. sustainability entrepreneurship===
With these dimensions clarified and distinctions made a common conceptual vagueness or lack of clarity needs to be addressed, where a strong need to distinguish clearly between sustainable, vs. ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship is identified. From this point of view, a very important distinction with the concept formed is claimed – ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship as in the concept ''sustainopreneurship; ''the use of entrepreneurial activity in a ''determined action orientation towards solving a sustainability-related problem'' with (creative) business organizing as a ''means'' to solve the problem(s) – '''business with a cause''': to turn business activity from a part of the problem to a part of the solution.'' Sustainable'' entrepreneurship is just a generic entrepreneurial process that takes into consideration the boundaries set by sustainability, and does not address where to and why, the destination, the purpose or the aim of the venture. The strategic intent and the business idea in itself are not related to sustainability ''per se,'' sustainability just being an "attachment" to the entrepreneurial process. The second and third dimensions are represented, but not the first. ''Sustainability'' entrepreneurship, in contrast, takes as its root of existence and strategic aim to solve a sustainability-related problem. This means that all three dimensions are simultaneously present: to take a sustainability innovation to the market through creative organizing with respect for life-supporting systems in the process.

== Future development ==

Given its recent date, there is a need for future research, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn13"/&gt; Main findings here are that conceptually, a deeper analysis is needed to be conducted with a nuanced and detailed taxonomy and framework created of sustainability innovations, the core of sustainopreneurship, primarily by cataloging and categorizing case stories. It is also needed to make a more detailed description to relate sustainopreneurship to other concepts in the wider, general idea-sphere of the "business case of sustainability", in the contemporary plethora of "buzz-words", approaches, methods and acronyms that already exists – and in this context also to motivate why this concept adds value. 

It has been recommended, though, to keep the research applied, to identify obstacles and institutional barriers, and how to overcome them; i. e. facilitating factors for sustainopreneurship, researching prospective tools, enablers and approaches. Appropriate areas and domains for sustainopreneurship applied are recommended to be digested. Research methods recommended are [[Enactive Research]]&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Open Space Technology]], since they add instant value among stakeholders, and in themselves naturally builds arenas where sustainopreneurship evolves and proliferates. For progress, beyond these "how"-related pointers, the key is to single out "the big questions", getting answers through collaborative, collective dialogue and conversation, with an explicit interaction and results orientation. Issues and topics have been formulated and outlined, where it is of striking importance with an intention to attract authentic forces potentially hearing this call of exploring the phenomenon further, with the purpose to collapse the degrees of separation in between the stakeholders of the sustainopreneurial concept – in idea, reflective practice and applied interaction to generate collective and collaborative wisdom for a deeper understanding of the concept. An association with this purpose is in its interim stages, ÆREAS(i).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11565">A '''retention of title clause''' (also called a '''''Romalpa'' clause''' in some jurisdictions) is a provision in a contract for the sale of goods that the title to the goods remains vested in the seller until certain obligations (usually payment of the purchase price) are fulfilled by the buyer.

==Purpose==

The main purpose of retention of title ("ROT") clauses is to ensure that where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]], the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid they should be able to repossess the goods.  Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or credit arrangement regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], where an [[Administration (insolvency)|administration order]] is made with respect to a company, section 11 of the ''[[Insolvency Act 1986]]'' prevents goods being repossessed without the leave of the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of title clauses are mandated in the [[European Union]] by Article 9 of the [[Late Payments Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial= 2011/7/EU|year= |date= 16 February 2011|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions (recast)|eurlextag= OJ:L:2011:048:0001:0010:EN:PDF}}, replacing Article 4 of {{cite EU directive |serial= 2000/35/EC|year= |date= 29 June 2000|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions|eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:200:0035:0038:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sellers' ROT rights are recognized by Article 7 of the [[Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000|Insolvency Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU regulation| serial= 1346/2000| date= 29 May 2000| description = on insolvency proceedings| eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:160:0001:0018:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially prevalent in [[Germany]],{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=13{{endash}}15}} these clauses are permitted in the United Kingdom by s.19 of the ''[[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]'', which expanded upon the 1976 judgment of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in ''[[Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 676&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to English law,{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=633}} the common-law jurisdictions in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] have instituted the concept of "[[security interest]]", under which ROT clauses may need to be registered in order to have effect:{{sfn|Duggan|2011|p=654}}

:* in the United States, states have adopted [[Secured transactions in the United States|Article 9]] of the ''[[Uniform Commercial Code]]'', which limits the clause's effectiveness{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=15{{endash}}18}}
:* common-law provinces in Canada have adopted their ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Acts]]'' which operate similarly
:* in [[Quebec]], there is no "presumption of [[hypothec]]", and therefore an ROT clause is not considered to be a [[security interest]]; art. 1497 of the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' provides that "An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives legal authority to such clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Peter J. Cullen|chapter = Canada|editor= Alexander von Ziegler|year= 2011|title= Transfer of Ownership in International Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H5m9VatRGkkC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=VCZ3hQQezh&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page = 73|location= The Netherlands|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Law International BV]]|isbn= 978-90-411-3134-8|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Australia and New Zealand have also adopted their own versions of the ''[[Personal Property Securities Register|Personal Property Security Act]]''

==Legal analysis==
Although title retention clauses are conceptually very simple, they have become increasingly widely drafted, which has resulted in the courts in a number of countries striking down the clauses, or recharacterising them as the grant of a [[security interest]]. It has consequentially been noted that "the practical outcome of a series of later cases has put it beyond doubt that 'extended' title reservation clauses will not work."{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=639}}  Several particular problems have been identified:

:* If for example, the clause reserves only part of the title to the seller (instead of reserving title to the whole thing) then in many jurisdictions this is [[recharacterisation|recharacterised]] as an [[Security interest#Equitable charge|equitable charge]], and is often void if certain registration requirements are not complied with.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England in ''Re Bond Worth Ltd'' [1980] Ch 228 such a clause was held to be void as it had not been registered within 21 days as required by section 395 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Problems can also arise where the goods sold are mixed with other goods of a similar nature, so that they are no longer identifiable (e.g. a quantity of oil, or grain).&lt;ref&gt;In most common law jurisdictions, so long as the clause prohibited mixing in this manner, the rule is that the buyer and the seller jointly own the whole mixture as [[Concurrent estate#Tenancy in common|tenants in common]], see ''[[Indian Oil v. Greenstone Shipping]]'' [1987] 3 WLR 869&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Many jurisdictions allow the buyer to re-sell the goods before title has passed to him (often this is the only way that he can pay the seller).  In many jurisdictions such an onward sale passes good title to the subsequent purchaser, and the original seller loses title despite the clause&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England this is the effect of section 25(1) of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], and section 2(1) of the Factors Act 1889&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where the seller tries to have a clause which provides that, if the buyer re-sells the goods, then the proceeds of sale of the goods shall be held on [[trust (law)|trust]] for the seller, this can be recharacterised as a registrable charge, which may also be void for non-registration.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''[[E Pfeiffer v. Arbuthnot Factors]]'' [1988] 1 WLR 150, although a differently worded clause was distinguished and upheld in ''[[Compaq Computer v. Abercorn]]'' [1991] BCC 484&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Another frequently litigated problem occurs where the goods which are subject to the clause are then either improved (e.g. raw thread is worked into cloth) or mixed with other raw materials to form a new product (e.g. silica is used to make glass).&lt;ref&gt;Generally speaking, in England, the law has been consistently applied that if the retention of title clause purports to apply to the new substance which has been made, then it takes effect as a charge and would be void if not registered, see for example, ''[[Re Peachdart]]'' [1984] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In some countries, where a clause purports to retain title until, not only the purchase price, but also any other debts of the buyer to the seller are paid in full, such clauses have been struck down for non-compliance with security registration requirements in those jurisdictions.

==Sample clauses==
Retention of title clauses will obviously vary from country to country, and even within countries they will usually be specialised to the form of industry used in, and the type of goods which are sold.  The following are just two examples of the types of clause which can be seen.

''A shorter form clause:''
:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.

''A longer form clause:''

:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.  Until title to {''the Goods''} passes:
:##{''the Seller''} shall have authority to retake, sell or otherwise deal with and/or dispose of all or any part of {''the Goods''};
:##{''the Seller''} and its agents and employees shall be entitled at any time and without the need to give notice enter upon any property upon which {''the Goods''} or any part are stored, or upon which {''the Seller''} reasonably believes them to be kept; 
:##{''the Buyer''} shall store or mark {''the Goods''} in a manner reasonably satisfactory to {''the Seller''} indicating that title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}; and
:##{''the Buyer''} shall insure {''the Goods''} to their full replacement value, and arrange for {''the Seller''} to be noted on the policy of insurance as the loss payee.
:#Irrespective of whether title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}, risk in {''the Goods''} shall pass to {''the Buyer''} upon delivery.

The '''Tulane Corporate Law Institute''' is an annual two-day [[M&amp;A]] and [[corporate law]] conference that takes place in [[New Orleans Central Business District|downtown New Orleans]] every spring.  It attracts the most high-profile lawyers and bankers from around the United States, as well as judges, journalists, and others who follow the dealmaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
In the late 1980s, [[Delaware Supreme Court]] Justice Andrew G.T. Moore (author of ''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'' and ''[[Revlon v.
