The '''4–4–5 calendar''' is a method of managing [[accounting]] periods, and is a common calendar structure for some industries such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

The 4–4–5 calendar divides a year into four quarters of 13 weeks grouped into two 4-week "months" and one 5-week "month". The grouping of 13 weeks may also be set up as 5–4–4 weeks or 4–5–4.

When this type of calendar is in use, reports with month-by-month comparisons or [[Financial analysis|trends]] are flawed as one month is 25% longer than the other two. It could still compare a period to the same period in the prior year, or use week by week data comparisons.

Its major advantage over a regular calendar is that the end date of the period is always the same day of the week, which is useful for shift or manufacturing planning as every period is the same length.

A disadvantage of the 4–4–5 calendar is that it has only 364 days (7 days x 52 weeks), meaning a 53rd week will need to be added every five or six years: this can make year-on-year comparison difficult.

== 52–53-week fiscal year ==
The 52–53-week [[fiscal year]] is a variation on the 4–4–5 calendar.  It is used by companies that desire that their fiscal year always end on the same day of the week.  Any day of the week may be used, and Saturday and Sunday are common because the business may more easily be closed for counting inventory and other end-of-year accounting activities.  There are two methods in use:

=== Last Saturday of the month at fiscal year end  ===
Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the final Saturday (or other day selected) in the fiscal year end month.  For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 25 to August 31.  In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 25 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 1.  In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:

* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-5}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-4}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-3}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+0}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+2}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+4}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+5}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+6}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+7}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+8}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+9}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+10}}|September|1|Saturday|Y F j}}

The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date seven days before the end of the month (August 24 in this case) or earlier.  At that point it resets to the end of the month (August 31) or earlier and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52.  In this example the fiscal years ending in 2013, 2019, and 2024 have 53 weeks.

=== Saturday nearest the end of month ===

Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the Saturday (or other day selected) that falls closest to the last day of the fiscal year end month.  For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 28 to September 3.  In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 28 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 4.  In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:

* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-5}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-4}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-3}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+0}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+1}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+2}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+4}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+5}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+6}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+7}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+8}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+9}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}
* {{Weekday before date|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+10}}|September|4|Saturday|Y F j}}

The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date four days before the end of the month (August 27 in this case) or earlier.  At that point the first Saturday in the following month (September 3 or earlier in this case) becomes the date closest to the end of August and it resets to that date and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52.  In this example the fiscal years ending in 2016, 2022, and 2028 have 53 weeks.

The 52–53 week method is permitted by [[generally accepted accounting principles]] in the United States, by US [[Internal Revenue Code]] Regulation 1.441-2 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 C.F.R. § 1.441-2|url=http://law.justia.com/cfr/title26/26-6.0.1.1.1.0.2.3.html|work=JUSTIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IRS Publication 538).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/ar02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Accounting ethics''' is primarily a field of [[applied ethics]] and is part of [[business ethics]] and human [[ethics]], the study of [[moral value]]s and judgments as they apply to [[accountancy]]. It is an example of [[professional ethics]]. Accounting introduced by [[Luca Pacioli]], and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training [[accountant]]s and [[audit]]ors.

Due to the diverse range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackling|first=Beverly|author2=Barry J.

==Importance of ethics==
The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment.&lt;ref name="FinReportShare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=David|author2=Anne Britton|title=Financial Reporting|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2004|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1OUTXGDWeWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|isbn=1-84480-033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company.&lt;ref name="AccAudRely"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=David|title='Auditors Are Timid'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KesNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QHADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2763,4354640&amp;dq=investors+rely+on+accountants+auditors|date=April 26, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.&lt;ref name="AcctEthicsBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duska|first=Ronald F.|author2=Brenda Shay Duska|title=Accounting Ethics|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y4LgVJgynCsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Accounting+Ethics|isbn=0-631-21651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws. In Germany, accounting legislation is governed by "tax law"; in Sweden, by "accounting law"; and in the United Kingdom, by the "[[United Kingdom company law|company law]]". In addition, countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting. For example, Sweden has the Bokföringsnämden (BFN - Accounting Standards Board), Spain the Instituto de Comtabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (ICAC), and the United States the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB).&lt;ref name="EthicalIssuesAcct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowthorpe|first=Catherine|author2=John Blake|title=Ethical Issues in Accounting|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=7|isbn=0-415-17173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting of two men. The man at the center is looking off to his right while drawing a symbol with his right hand. His left hand is resting on a page in a book. He is wearing a robe with a hood. The man on the right is looking towards the front and is wearing a long-sleeve red shirt with a black jacket. Several writing utensils and books are on a table with a green tablecloth in the front of the image.|Luca Pacioli, here in [[Portrait of Luca Pacioli|a 1495 portrait by an unknown Renaissance artist]], wrote on accounting ethics in 1494.]]
[[Luca Pacioli]], the "Father of Accounting", wrote on accounting ethics in his first book {{lang|la|[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni, et proportionalita]]}}, published in 1494.&lt;ref name="PacioliEthics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=L.

These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment. Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member. United States accounting societies such as the [[Association of Government Accountants]], [[Institute of Internal Auditors]], and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics, and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Teaching Students Accounting Ethics: Some Crucial Issues|journal=Issues in Accounting Education|volume=3|pages=316–329|date=Fall 1988|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=7569002&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casler|first=Darwin J.|title=The Evolution of CPA Ethics: A Profile of Professionalization|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|year=1964|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members.&lt;ref name="CriticalPerspectives209"&gt;{{cite book|editor=J. Edward Ketz|title=Accounting Ethics: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management|last=Preston|first=Alistair M.|author2=David J. Cooper|author3= D. Paul Scarbrough|author4=Robert C.

As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"/&gt; Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field.&lt;ref name="IllInsEthics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookkeepers Repel Inference That Their Own Employers Were Aimed At.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/403309611.html?dids=403309611:403309611&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1907&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DISCUSS+ACCOUNTING+ETHICS.&amp;pqatl=google|format = Fee required|accessdate=December 14, 2010|date=February 28, 1907|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: "independence, integrity, and objectivity"; "competence and technical standards"; "responsibilities to clients"; "responsibilities to colleagues"; as well as "other responsibilities and practices".&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=James H.|title=Accounting Student Perceptions of Business and Professional Ethics|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]]|year=1981|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry.&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"/&gt;

==Teaching ethics==
Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="EthicsPays"/&gt; Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way.&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Issues Relating to Teaching Accounting Ethics: An 18 Year Retrospective|journal=Research and Professional Responsibility and Ethics in Accounting|volume=11|page=4|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bW5PXF3I0HwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22#PPA4,M1|isbn=978-0-7623-1367-9|accessdate=May 14, 2009|doi=10.1016/s1574-0765(06)11001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name="AnonCenterEthics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=First Center to Study Accounting Ethics Opens|journal=Journal of Accountancy|volume=176|issue=4|page=19|date=October 1993|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=558663&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|CPA exam]].&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeasy.com/ethics-cpe-courses/index.aspx "State Regulatory Accounting Ethics"] retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=35em|bgcolor=|quote='''Seven goals of accounting ethics education'''
*Relate accounting education to moral issues.
*Recognize issues in accounting that have ethical implications.
*Develop "a sense of moral obligation" or responsibility.
*Develop the abilities needed to deal with ethical conflicts or dilemmas.
*Learn to deal with the uncertainties of the accounting profession.
*"Set the stage for" a change in ethical behavior.
*Appreciate and understand the history and composition of all aspects of accounting ethics and their relationship to the general field of ethics. —Stephen E. Loeb&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;}}

In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan).&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; To implement these goals, he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;

==Accounting scandals==
{{main|Accounting scandals}}
Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Goal: Ethical Standards for Accounting Practices|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=27058245&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client "what does two plus two equal?" the accountant would be likely to respond "what would you like it to be?".&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"/&gt; This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.

The role of accountants is critical to society. Accountants serve as financial reporters and
intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest. The
information they provide is crucial in aiding managers, investors and others in making critical economic
decisions. Accordingly, ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society, resulting in
distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations.

}}
From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of [[creative accounting]], misleading [[financial analysis]], as well as [[bribe]]ry. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including [[Nugan Hand Bank#Scandal and collapse|Nugan Hand Bank]], [[Phar-Mor#Bankruptcy|Phar-Mor]], [[WorldCom#Accounting scandals|WorldCom]], and [[American International Group#Accounting fraud claims|AIG]]. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved [[Enron]], a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor [[Arthur Andersen]], an accounting firm considered one of the "[[Big Four auditors|Big Five]]", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.&lt;ref name="AASignOff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Auditors: In the palm of the banks?|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5580824.ece|date=January 25, 2009|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=June 18, 2009 | location=London | first1=Iain | last1=Dey | first2=Dominic | last2=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business.

===Causes===
Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's [[corporate culture]] as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior.&lt;ref name="ClikeTrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clikeman|first=Paul M.|title=Educating for the Public Trust|journal=The CPA Journal|volume=73|issue=8|page=80|date=August 2003|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003019/http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleClimate"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Appelbaum|first=Steven H.|author2=Kyle J Deguire |author3=Mathieu Lay|title=The Relationship of Ethical Climate to Deviant Workplace Behaviour|journal=Corporate Governance|volume=5|issue=4|pages=43–55|year=2005|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=914821791&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 8, 2009| doi=10.1108/14720700510616587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;

Until 1977, ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When the rules were lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from [[United States dollar|US$]]4 million in the 1980s to more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Advertising has hurt accounting's ethics: critics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1464160.html|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, which led to a conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Apj , "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors."&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"/&gt; As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose.&lt;ref name="WashPost1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crenshaw|first=Albert B.|author2=Brett D.

A 2007 article in ''Managerial Auditing Journal'' determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]]. The factors include (in order of most significant): "self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand advocacy threats, lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support."&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically.

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) are standards and interpretations developed by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]], which are principle-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scannell|first=Kara|author2=Joanna Slater|title=SEC Moves To Pull Plug On U.S. Accounting Standards|url=http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511112508/http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the [[European Union]], Australia, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="IFRSList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of IFRSs by Jurisdiction|url=http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm#totals|date=March 24, 2009|publisher=[[International Financial Reporting Standards|IAS]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512150619/http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt; Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered.&lt;ref name="BizJourBoil"/&gt; The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.&lt;ref name="BennettRules"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |last=Bennett |first=Bruce |author2=Michael Bradbury |author3=Helen Pragnell |title=Rules, Principles and Judgments in Accounting Standards |journal=Abacus |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=189–203 |year=2006 |format=Registration required |ssrn=907368 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00197.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511192601/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |archivedate=11 May 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segovia|first=Joann|title=Do Principles- vs. Rules-Based Standards Have a Differential Impact on U.S. Auditors' Decisions?|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1871151361&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=31810&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS is based on "understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability".&lt;ref name="RRCUMIFRS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosen|first=Graeme|title=A Practical Guide to IFRS for Derivatives and Structured Finance|publisher=Euromoney Books|year=2006|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=00Jco44doU0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=relevance,+reliability,+comparability,+understandability,+and+materiality+IFRS|isbn=1-84374-267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries, these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain. In particular, the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult. In August 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS, starting in 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt;

===Responses to scandals===
Since the major accounting scandals, new reforms, regulations, and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior.&lt;ref name="PerfReport17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnsson|first=Hans|author2=Per Erik Kihlstedt|title=Performance-Based Reporting|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2005|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T2sIinuZlHIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22|isbn=0-471-73543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="DellaDifference"/&gt; Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.&lt;ref name="BizJourChampion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mader|first=Becca|title=Enron case causes colleges to champion accounting ethics|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html|date=May 3, 2002|publisher=''[[The Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523034641/http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New regulations in response to the scandals include the [[Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004]] in Australia as well as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, developed by the United States.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects [[whistleblower]]s and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's [[accounting records]]. In 2002, the five members of the [[Public Oversight Board]] (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB).&lt;ref name="5PCAOB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|title=Accounting Ethics Panel Members Resign, Rejecting Sec Chief's Plan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YuwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M3ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3645,467306&amp;dq=accounting+ethics|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.&lt;ref name="ManagerialAcctBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Ronald W.|title=Managerial Accounting: Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|edition=Sixth|year=2005|page=26|isbn=0-07-111314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) released a report entitled ''Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective''.&lt;ref name="IFARebuild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crow |first=John |author2=Christian Aubin |author3=Olivia Kirtley |author4=Kosuke Nakahira |author5=Ian Ramsay |author6=Guylaine Saucier |author7=Graham Ward |title=Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective |url=http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=[[International Federation of Accountants]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528233709/http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |archivedate=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;
A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by [[Michel Prada]], Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority, resulting in establishment of the [[Public Interest Oversight Board]] (PIOB) on 1 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The PIOB provides oversight of the IFAC standards-setting boards: the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board]] (IAASB), the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) and the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers a broad range of changes. The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710034423/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf |date=2010-07-10 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to the Office of the Whistleblower." U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Home Page). Web. 31 Oct. 2011. &lt;https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.

{{for|the band|Action Item}}
In [[management]], an '''action item''' is a documented event, task, activity, or [[action (philosophy)|action]] that needs to take place. Action items are discrete units that can be handled by a single person.

==Planning actions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
Action items are usually created during a discussion by a group of people who are [[meeting]] about one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some kind of action is needed.  The act required is then documented as an action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the group.  The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to perform the action and report back to the group on the results.

Action items are usually documented in the meeting [[minutes]] and are recorded in the [[task list]] of the group.  As people complete action items, the items are documented as being completed and the item is removed from the list of outstanding action items.

==Attributes==
There are many attributes that can be associated with an action item - e.g.:
* Identifier - Unique mark to reference event or item.
* Description - Short explanation of activity to be performed
* Work stream - Business requirements, technical design, user interface, commit checklist, commit gate materials, etc. (optional)
* Issue or Risk - Associated with a project issue or risk
* Status - Open, In Progress, Resolved, Canceled
* Urgency/Priority - What is the impact to your project's critical path?
* Comments - Description of what is now being done to solve the issue
* Owner - Who is responsible for actively working the issue?
* Created Date - Date issue was opened
* Planned completion date - When will this issue be solved?
* Actual completion date - Date issue was closed

==Tracking==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
A usual format for an action item is to record an action item number, the date when the action item is identified or created, the name of the person to whom the action is assigned, a title description of the action, a more detailed description of the action and its outcomes, and its deliverables.

An action item can be considered a more general form of various types of action/issue/defect tracking methods.  For instance, a [[bug report]] is a form of action item as is a service report created by a service company to track a problem reported by a customer or an [[Return Merchandise Authorization|RMA]] number.

Follow up in a consistent and timely manner with the responsible individual(s) to track their progress and drive the action item to resolution.

It is important to understand the distinction here that we track to resolution and not to completion.  While it is the goal to have every action item completed, there are numerous scenarios in which the action item may no longer be relevant or completion may not be possible.

==Software==

There are a number of software applications for tracking action items or service reports.  These applications are used within software development organizations as well as in customer support functions.  Because these software applications facilitate group communication, they are often referred to as [[Collaborative software]] or groupware.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Various such software are available in the market. They are known to increase the productivity of Managers.

Many information technology support groups use some kind of service report software so that when a trouble report is called in, the person answering the telephone will create a trouble ticket to track the issue.  The trouble ticket is assigned to a member of the IT services organization who then visits the person who has reported a problem and resolves the problem.  The IT services person will then close out the trouble ticket indicating the issue has been resolved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Recent research at the Computational Semantics Lab at [[Stanford University]] seeks to automatically identify action items and extract their properties (the ''what'', ''who'', and ''when'' of the action item) using [[automatic speech recognition]] transcripts from spontaneous, multi-party conversations during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sigdial06.pdf|title=Automatically Detecting Action Items in Audio Meeting Recordings|website=Stanford EDU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''aisle411 Inc.''' is a [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] based company that has developed a [[consumer]] service called '''aisle411''', which allows customers to use their phones to find products in stores. Founded in 2008 by [[Nathan Pettyjohn]] (Founder) and [[Matthew Kulig]] (Co-Founder), aisle411 entered the market in August 2009 with a mobile service that allowed consumers to search retail stores for product locations inside stores using their [[mobile phone]]s.

==History==
In August 2009, aisle411 launched its original product location service in St. Louis, MO area Ace Hardware [[Ace Hardware]] locations and Springfield, MO area Price Cutter grocery stores. In 2010, aisle411 launched its mobile smartphone service with Shop 'n Save, a grocery chain owned by Supervalu [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]] and Schnucks [[Schnucks]] grocery stores in the St. Louis, MO area. In September 2011, WinCo Foods [[WinCo Foods]] partnered with aisle411 to deploy its technology chainwide to its 79 stores. In December 2011, Hyvee [[Hy-Vee]], a grocery chain of 235 store locations launched the aisle411 platform within their mobile iPhone and Android applications allowing shoppers to map products, lists, and weekly ads.  In September 2012, Walgreens [[Walgreens|Walgreens Co.]] launched the aisle411 platform in its iPhone and Android mobile applications, making Walgreens in-store inventory searchable and mappable in over 7,800 locations.

In September 2012, aisle411 acquired the technology assets of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130510114750/http://www.wilocate.net/ WiLocate], adding indoor mobile device positioning technology to its service offering.&lt;ref&gt;http://supermarketnews.com/latest-news/shop-n-save-supports-updated-navigation-app&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.progressivegrocer.com/top-stories/headlines/technology/id33712/winco-foods-deploys-mobile-in-store-navigation-service/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234316/http://www.progressivegrocer.com/top-stories/headlines/technology/id33712/winco-foods-deploys-mobile-in-store-navigation-service |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-07-16-looking-for-pain-relief-app-tells-you-which-aisle-in-walgreens/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/BizNext/2012/09/with-acquisition-aisle411-wants-to.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, aisle411 raised $6.3 million in its first round of financing - led by St. Louis-based Cultivation Capital - to help the company scale, meet demand and expand retail partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/04/aisle411-raises-6-3m-to-create-digital-maps-of-physical-stores/&lt;/ref&gt; Another company that has invested in aisle411 includes [[Billiken Angels Network]].

== History ==
SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding.&lt;ref name="SanFranBusinessTimesRoundOne"&gt;{{cite news|title=SAP Ventures invests $6M in Alteryx Inc.|first=Steven|last=Brown|newspaper=San Francisco Business Times|date=5 April 2011|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2011/04/05/sap-ventures-invests-6m-in-alteryx-inc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"&gt;{{cite press release |title=SRC Corporate Overview |url= http://src.mediaroomshowcase.com/file.php/2441/SRC+backgrounder.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ExtendTheReach.Com / Products / SoloCast |url= http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate |archivedate=8 February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208021200/http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data.&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Census deal for O.C. firm |first=Jan |last=Norman |newspaper=The Orange County Register |date=17 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on [[CD-ROMs]] of [[United States Census|Census Data]] sold by the [[U.S. Census Bureau|Bureau]].&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCameraCensus"&gt;{{cite news|date=5 July 2001|newspaper=Daily Camera|title=SRC organizing census data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.&lt;ref name=10K2017/&gt;

In 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] investment arm of [[SAP AG]], SAP Ventures.&lt;ref name="SanFranBusinessTimesRoundOne"/&gt; In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and [[Toba Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 May 2013|first=Chris|last=Casacchia|newspaper=Orange County Business Journal|title=Toba in $12M Round for Big Data Analytics Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=TechCrunch|title=Alteryx Raises $12M For Data Analytics Platform That Shapes Data Into Apps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/819570/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding&lt;ref name="FortuneRoundB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCameraRoundB"/&gt; from [[Insight Venture Partners]], [[SAP AG|SAP Ventures]] and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.&lt;ref name="BizWest"/&gt;

In 2015, Iconiq Capital led a $85 million investment in Alteryx, with [[Insight Venture Partners]] and [[Meritech Capital Partners]] also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Iconiq Capital Leads $85 Million Investment in Alteryx|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/dealbook/iconiq-capital-leads-85-million-investment-in-alteryx.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-28|access-date = 2015-10-28|issn = 0362-4331|first = Leslie|last = Picker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Data firm Alteryx secures $85M investment, could make "unicorn" list|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/company-689558-alteryx-customers.html|newspaper = Orange County Register|date = 2015-10-28|first = Lauren|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''Artifact-centric business process model'''  represents an operational [[business process model|model of business processes]] in which the changes and evolution of [[business data]], or [[Business entity (computer science)|business entities]], are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, also called activity-centric or process-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is change/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.

== Overview ==
In general, a process model describes activities conducted in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. [[Workflow]]s, as a typical [[process modeling]] approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., [[control flow]]s), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.

Business process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the “correct” realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.

Intuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.

== Research and history ==
Artifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell&lt;ref&gt;Nigam, A. and N.S. Caswell, Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification. IBM Syst. J., 2003. 42(3): p. 428-445.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here.&lt;ref name="BH2005"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., A model-driven approach to industrializing discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 2005. CCCT CCCEC(1): p. 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH2007"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., et al., Towards Formal Analysis of Artifact-Centric Business Process Models, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 288-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIU2007"&gt;Liu, R., K. Bhattacharya, and F. Wu, Modeling Business Contexture and Behavior Using Business Artifacts, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2007. p. 324-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="BH2005" /&gt; described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al.&lt;ref name="LIU2007"/&gt; formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al.&lt;ref name="BH2007"/&gt; provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaran, S., R. Liu, and F. Wu, On the Duality of Information-Centric and Activity-Centric Models of Business Processes, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2008. p. 32-47.&lt;/ref&gt; presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.

Other approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"&gt;[[Van der Aalst, W.M.P.]], [[Mathias Weske|M. Weske]], and D. Grünbauer, Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support. Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, 2005. 53(2): p. 129-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WANG2005"&gt;Wang, J. and A. Kumar, A Framework for Document-Driven Workflow Systems, in Business Process Management. 2005. p. 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Aalst et al.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"/&gt; provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar&lt;ref name="WANG2005"/&gt; proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al.&lt;ref name="MULLER2007"&gt;Müller, D., M. Reichert, and J. Herbst, Data-Driven Modeling and Coordination of Large Process Structures, in On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2007: CoopIS, DOA, ODBASE, GADA, and IS. 2009. p. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.

Another related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations.&lt;ref name="RYNDINA2007"&gt;Ryndina, K., J. Küster, and H. Gall, Consistency of Business Process Models and Object Life Cycles, in Models in Software Engineering. 2007. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding et al.&lt;ref name="REDDING2008"&gt;Redding, G., et al., Generating business process models from object behavior models. Information Systems Management, 2008. 25(4): p. 319-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Küster et al.&lt;ref name="KUSTER2007"&gt;Küster, J., K. Ryndina, and H. Gall, Generation of Business Process Models for Object Life Cycle Compliance, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt; give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.

More recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"&gt;Gerede, C. and J. Su, Specification and Verification of Artifact Behaviors in Business Process Models, in Service-Oriented Computing – ICSOC 2007. 2009. p. 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"&gt;Gerede, C.E., K. Bhattacharya, and J. Su, Static analysis of business artifact-centric operational models. Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA 2007, 2007: p. 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"&gt;Fritz, C., R. Hull, and J. Su, Automatic construction of simple artifact-based business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"&gt;Deutsch, A., et al., Automatic verification of data-centric business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerede and Su&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"/&gt; developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"/&gt; identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.

Fritz, Hull, and Su&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"/&gt; formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"/&gt; introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.

Sira and Chengfei&lt;ref name="YONGCHAREON2010"&gt;Yongchareon, S., Liu, C.: Process View Framework for Artifact-Centric Business Processes, in R. Meersman et al. (Eds.): OTM 2010, Part I. LNCS, vol. 6426, pp. 26–43. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yongchareon|first1=Sira|title=A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes|journal=Information Systems|date=2015|volume=47|pages=51–81|doi=10.1016/j.is.2014.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of MBAs''' ('''AMBA''') is a global organisation founded in 1967 which focuses primarily on international business school accreditation and membership.

== Activities ==
Based in London, AMBA is one of the three main global accreditation bodies in business education (see '''[[Triple accreditation|Triple Accreditation]]''') and styles itself as the world's impartial authority on postgraduate management education. It differs from [[AACSB]] in the [[United States|US]] and [[EQUIS]] in [[Brussels]] as it accredits a school's portfolio of postgraduate management programmes but does not accredit undergraduate programmes. AMBA accredits approximately 2% of the world's business schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/business-schools/business-school-search/schools-a-to-z|title=Accredited Business Schools A-Z - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most international of the three organisations having accredited schools headquartered in 54 countries, compared with the 52 for AACSB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-members|title=AACSB-Accredited Schools|website=www.aacsb.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38 for EQUIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools|title=EQUIS Accredited Schools|last=Pergoot|first=Nick|website=www.efmd.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business schools can become associated with AMBA in two ways: by applying for accreditation, or by applying for membership of the '''AMBA Development Network (ADN),''' which confers institutional membership similar to [[EFMD]] or AACSB membership. Schools that cannot meet all of the AMBA accreditation criteria usually join the ADN, which gives them time to prepare for accreditation with support from AMBA and mentoring from an AMBA-accredited school.

All MBA students and alumni of the [[List of institutions accredited by AMBA|257 accredited member schools]] join AMBA as individual members free of charge. AMBA also accredits generalist [[Master of Management|MBM]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] programmes, and admits as members students and graduates thereof.

AMBA's long-serving president until 2017 was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], the founding benefactor of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] in Cambridge, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/president|title=President - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMBA's current Chief Executive is '''Andrew Main Wilson''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/chief-executive|title=Chief Executive - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined the organisation from the [[Institute of Directors]] in 2013. '''Bodo Schlegelmilch''' was elected Chairman of the AMBA Board of Trustees in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/board-of-trustees|title=Board of Trustees - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association of MBAs was founded in 1967 as an MBA alumni club by eight [[UK]] graduates from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford]] and [[Columbia Business School|Columbia]], and two graduates from the first intake of [[London Business School]]. The founders saw a lack of awareness in [[Europe]] of the value of the MBA degree, which at that time was primarily an American qualification. They decided to form a lobby and membership group to promote the benefits of postgraduate business education, under the name of Business Graduates Association (BGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's development helped shape the growth of management education in Europe and the UK and coincided with the setting up and growth of [[London Business School]] and [[Manchester Business School]] in Britain.

The Association's first Director General was Vice-Admiral [[David Clutterbuck]] who assumed this position in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Association of MBAs fabulous at forty, Ambition, January 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045432/http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 BGA began to accredit the growing number of [[MBA]] programmes, while preserving its functions as a membership organization. BGA was renamed Association of MBAs in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbaworld.com/aboutus/ourhis1&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2017, AMBA's president was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], who helped establish one of the two business schools in Cambridge, UK.

=== Accreditation ===
[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]The Association of MBAs accredits MBA, MBM and DBA degree programmes. When a school  applies for accreditation for its MBA programmes, AMBA requires that the entire portfolio of MBA programmes be put up for consideration and will award accreditation only if all programmes meet its criteria (though the school pays the same fee regardless of the number of programmes being reviewed).

The Association's process of accrediting a school's MBA programmes portfolio includes reviewing compliance AMBA's criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; programme administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, programme mode and duration; and learning outcomes.

Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA programme include:
* all admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course (''a criterion which the vast majority of the top US business schools cannot meet as US MBA programmes sometimes admit applicants with only a bachelor's degree and no work experience'');
* a new school applying for accreditation should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited;
* an MBA programme should have a cohort size of at least 20 students;
* at least 50% of the faculty of an MBA programme (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are expected to have PhD degrees; and
* a full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (scheduled faculty-mediated) hours and a distance-learning MBA programme should have no less than 120 synchronous contact hours.

===  Events ===
AMBA holds three annual conferences for business school deans and directors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbaworld.com/bschoolevents Events for business schools - Association of MBAs]. Mbaworld.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; a Global Conference, an Asia Pacific Conference, and a Latin America Conference. Participation is open to both accredited and non-accredited schools. AMBA also hosts an annual Gala Dinner in London, which is open only to accredited schools.

AMBA organises two annual global forums with the purpose of development and training for specific functions within AMBA-accredited business schools such as accreditation managers; programme managers; marketing, admissions, alumni and development staff.

AMBA also organises webinars, lectures and networking events on a regular basis catering to MBA alumni, current MBA students, prospective MBA students and business school admissions departments. These on-campus events are held at accredited business schools and often feature distinguished speakers and practitioners in fields such as leadership, entrepreneurship and innovation.

'''Bates Australia''' is a leading [[saddle]] manufacturer originally established in 1934. Bates Saddlery was formed when Mr. George Bates borrowed $100 from his sister, bought a sewing machine and began to make saddles on the veranda of his home in Perth, Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Bates Australia"&gt;[http://www.batessaddles.com.au Bates Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bates Australia is the parent company to [[Bates Saddles]] and [[Wintec]].&lt;ref name="The Horse"&gt;[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4285 The Horse: The Right Saddle for the Job&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The family-owned business, located in Perth, Western Australia, has expanded into many international markets and can now be found in 36 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiac.wa.gov.au/sme/smx-10.htm A Snapshot of Export Activity in Western Australia's SME Sector 6Supply and Local Factors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831090707/http://www.tiac.wa.gov.au/sme/smx-10.htm |date=2007-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Prism''' is the trading name of the '''Blue Prism Group''', a UK multinational software corporation that pioneered and makes enterprise [[robotic process automation]] software to eliminate low-return, high-risk, manual data entry and processing work. Blue Prism is headquartered in [[Newton-le-Willows]], [[Merseyside]], UK&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch"&gt;{{Citation|title=Software Robots Pioneer Blue Prism Debuts on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM Market|publisher=Business Wire|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160315005923/en/Software-Robots-Pioneer-Blue-Prism-Debuts-London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regional offices in the US and Australia.&lt;ref name="InnovCenter"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism Opens Global Technical Innovation Center|publisher=Business Wire|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170106005044/en/Blue-Prism-Opens-Global-Technical-Innovation-Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUSOffice"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism Opens Global Technical Innovation Center|publisher=Business Wire|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170118006146/en/Blue-Prism-Expands-Presence-Asia-Pacific-Sales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM market.&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch" /&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
Blue Prism was founded in 2001 by a group of process automation experts to develop technology that could be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations.&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch" /&gt; Initially their focus was on the white collar back office where they recognised an enormous unfulfilled need for automation. The company was co-founded by Alastair Bathgate and David Moss&lt;ref name="AIMLaunch" /&gt;  to provide a new business-led, more granular and economic approach that today is known as [[Robotic Process Automation]], or RPA. In doing so Blue Prism created a digital workforce. In 2003 Blue Prism’s first commercial product was launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Co-operative Financial Services]] began using Blue Prism software in 2005, to automate manual processes in customer services.&lt;ref name=cw-extends&gt;
{{cite news |last=Ashford |first=Warwick |date=August 29, 2007 |title=Co-operative bank extends automation with Blue Prism |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240082707/Co-operative-bank-extends-automation-with-Blue-Prism | work=[[Computer Weekly]] |location= |access-date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robotic Process Automation===
[[Robotic Process Automation]] (RPA) is the application of technology that provides organizations with a digital workforce that follows rule-based business processes and interacts with the organisations systems in the same way that existing users currently do.&lt;ref name="LSEBook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Service Automation: Robots and The Future of Work|publisher=London School of Economics|page= |isbn=0956414567 |author=Professors Leslie Willcocks and Mary Lacity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesBPO"&gt;{{Citation|title=Times BPO Supplement|publisher=Raconteur|url=http://np.netpublicator.com/netpublication/n34908574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechChangingBPO"&gt;{{Citation|title=How is technology changing BPO?|publisher=Computer Weekly|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/inside-outsourcing/2012/06/how-is-technology-changing-bpo.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HfSThreat"&gt;{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing#|archive-date=2015-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChappelERPA"&gt;{{Citation|title=Understanding Enterprise RPA: The Blue Prism Example|publisher=David Chappel &amp; Associates|url=http://www.davidchappell.com/writing/white_papers/Understanding_Enterprise_RPA--The_Blue_Prism_Example_v1.0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSENewApproach"&gt;{{Citation|title=A new approach to automating services|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68135/1/Willcocks_New%20approach_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HFSUnderlings"&gt;{{Citation|title=Welcoming our robotic security underlings|publisher=HFS Research|url=https://www.hfsresearch.com/pointsofview/welcoming-our-robotic-security-underlings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Prism coined the term "robotic automation" in 2012.&lt;ref name=rauto&gt;

Previously, the software had run on customers' own servers.&lt;ref name=fortune-blue&gt;{{cite news |last=Darrow |first=Barb |date=June 6, 2017 |title=This Software Helps Bots Do Their Work |url=http://fortune.com/2017/06/07/blue-prism-bots/ | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |location= |access-date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue Prism technology==
Blue Prism is built on the [[Microsoft .NET Framework]]. It automates any application and supports any platform ([[mainframe]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], web, etc.) presented in a variety of ways (terminal emulator, thick client, thin client, web browser, Citrix and web services). It has been designed for a multi-environment deployment model (development, test, staging, and production) with both physical and logical access controls. Blue Prism RPA software includes a centralized release management interface and process change distribution model providing high levels of visibility and control. Additional control is provided to the business via a centralised model for process development and re-use. The software supports regulatory contexts such as [[PCI-DSS]], [[HIPAA]] and [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|SOX]], with a large number of controls in place to provide the necessary security and governance.

In 2016, Blue Prism received one of the top honors at the AIconics Awards, named as The Best Enterprise Application of AI.&lt;ref name="AIConics"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism: Best Enterprise Application of AI|publisher=aibusiness.org|url=http://aibusiness.org/aiconics-award-winners-blue-prism-best-enterprise-application-of-ai-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIConics2"&gt;{{Citation|title=London 2016 AIConics Winners|publisher=theaiconics.com|url=http://theaiconics.com/2016-winners/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Prism supports only "back-office" unattended robots and does not offer attended "front-office" robots.&lt;ref name="Comparison of two RPA leaders BluePrism and UiPath"&gt;{{Citation|title=Comparison of two RPA leaders BluePrism and UiPath|publisher=blog|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comparison-two-rpa-leaders-blueprism-uipath-jakub-vaňhara/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
The main competitors in the Robotic Process Automation market include UIPath and Automation Anywhere. &lt;ref name="Blue Prism Competitors and Alternatives in Robotic Process Automation"&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue Prism Competitors and Alternatives in Robotic Process Automation|publisher=gartner.com|url=https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/robotic-process-automatio-software/vendor/blue-prism/alternatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The independent market research company Forrester Research identified these three companies as leaders both in terms of their market presence as well as the quality of their offering in a 2017 study.
&lt;ref name="forrester-wave-robotic-process-automation"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Forrester Wave™: Robotic Process Automation, Q1 2017|publisher=forrester.com|url=https://www.edgeverve.com/wpcontent/uploads/2017/02/forrester-wave-robotic-process-automation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, industry analyst firm [[Wikibon]] attempted to test Robotic Process Automation platforms noting: "we contacted three RPA vendors — Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and UiPath — to test and validate each of these propositions. Only one vendor, UIPath, responded."&lt;ref name="Assessing RPA Time-to-Value"&gt;{{Citation|title=Assessing RPA Time-to-Value with UiPath|publisher=blog|url=https://wikibon.com/assessing-rpa-time-value-uipath/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The digital workforce==
Blue Prism’s digital workforce is built, managed and owned by the user or customer, spanning operations and technology, adhering to an enterprise-wide robotic operating model. It is code-free&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{Citation|title=What knowledge workers stand to gain from automation|publisher=Harvard Business Review|url=https://hbr.org/2015/06/what-knowledge-workers-stand-to-gain-from-automation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can automate any software in a non-invasive way. The digital workforce can be applied to automate processes in any department where clerical or administrative work is performed across an organization.&lt;ref name="TEDxDavidMoss"&gt;{{Citation|title=White Collar Robots: The Virtual Workforce|publisher=TEDx Talks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SximAg9t4w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and markets==
Blue Prism has been deployed in a number of industries including banking, finance and insurance, consumer package goods, legal services, public sector, professional services, healthcare and utilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4922">'''Business Planning and Control System''' (BPCS) is an [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) [[software]] designed for an [[OS/400]] system.&lt;ref name=ITJungle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodie|first1=Alex|title=SSA Delivers New ERP LX Platform for iSeries|url=http://www.itjungle.com/fhs/fhs051005-story01.html|publisher=IT Jungle|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPCS is a series of software programs that are the largest software supplier for AS/400.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse&gt;{{cite web|title=System Software Associates, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/system-software-associates-inc-history/|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BPCS'', the acronym for the software, is pronounced as "Bee picks".&lt;ref name=BeePicks&gt;{{cite web|title=Infor ERP BPCS/LX Document Management|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rQIg7VRbI|website=YouTube|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
BPCS was developed by Chicago-based System Software Associates (SSA), which later became [[SSA Global Technologies]]&lt;ref name=ITJungle /&gt; (which was then acquired by [[Infor Global Solutions]] and rebranded as Infor LX), and is used to control the operations of manufacturing companies. BPCS includes [[Material requirements planning|MRP]] [[logic]] to manufacturing operations, provided there are high standards of data validity such as [[engineering]] specifications and [[inventory]] accuracy. It runs on several systems, with the [[IBM System i]] (previously named IBM AS/400 and IBM eServer iSeries),  being most popular.  It is written in AS/SET [[CASE tool]], [[RPG programming language|RPG]], [[SQL]] and other [[IBM]] languages supported on the System i.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse/&gt;

Many of the BPCS modules are stand-alone,&lt;ref name=ITJungle /&gt; in that companies can choose to implement only the financial applications for example, and none of the manufacturing.  

SSA began developing BPCS in the early 1980s; by the mid 1990s the BPCS programs were used internationally.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse/&gt; ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. magazine]]'' ranked SSA as the 23rd fastest growing small public company in 1988&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse/&gt; and ''[[Business Week]]'' named it as the 25th best small company.

== BPCS Applications ==
BPCS Applications are very dependent on BPCS software version release, because SSA enters into partnerships with different specialty suppliers of applications such as [[Data Mining]], [[barcode|Bar Coding]], etc. and suppliers that integrated with a particular version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">The term '''business operating system''' ('''BOS''') refers to standard, enterprise-wide collection of [[business process]]es used in many diversified industrial companies. The definition has also been extended to include the common structure, principles and practices necessary to drive the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hope Is Not a Strategy | author = Ted Gee | page = 85 | publisher = Dog Ear | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-59858-767-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversified industrial companies like [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Honeywell]], and [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]] have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or [[business process management|business process improvement methodologies]] which they use to manage strategy development and execution. In the case of [[Danaher]], the business system is a core part of the company's culture, is seen as one of the key drivers of corporate performance, and is therefore a differentiator for shareholders and prospective employees.

The objectives of such systems are to ensure daily work is focused on the organisation's strategic objectives and is done in the most efficient way. The systems deal with the questions "why" (purpose of the work), "what" (specific objectives of the work) and "how" (the processes used to do the work). The Toyota Production System is focused on both how to make cars, and how to improve the way cars are made. A third objective can also be added, which is to improve the business system itself by identifying or improving the component tools and techniques.

== Terminology. ==
Terms used to describe such systems include:
* XPS - meaning “Company-specific Production System" with the X standing in place of the company name
* Business System
* Management Operating System

== Examples of business operating systems ==
* [[Toyota]]'s [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) is one of the earliest examples, developed between 1948 and 1975
* [[Danaher]] is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danaher.com/how-we-work/danaher-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fortive]] (a company that split from Danaher in 2016) has the Fortive Business System (FBS) which is derived from the DBS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fortive.com/fortive-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ingersoll Rand]] established the Ingersoll Rand business operating system (BOS) to describe the six enterprise focus areas and its process improvement method ([[Lean Six Sigma]]).
* [[Honeywell]] has the Honeywell Operating System (HOS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honeywell.com/who-we-are/our-initiatives/hos-gold&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Idex Corporation]] has the Idex Operating Model &lt;ref&gt;http://www.idexcorp.com/about/about_strategy.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.etw.com/ ETW (Execute to Win)]
* Bosch Production System
* Boeing Production System
* Audi Production System
* Lego Production System
* John Deere Quality and Production System
* Alcoa Business System
* REC Production System
* Electrolux Manufacturing System
* Novo Nordisk - "cLEAN” 
* Trumpf - “Synchro”
* Magellan Operating System ([[Magellan Aerospace]])

== List of common features ==
Many of business operating systems share common features. This is because the systems are derived from other known systems, and from established methods and practices for business management. The following is a list of features that appear in several systems.

'''Business process automation (BPA)''', also known as '''business automation''' or '''digital transformation''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/06/29/mapping-out-business-process-automation-how-bpm-functions-like-a-gps/#3d91f3a33feb Mapping Out Business Process Automation: How BPM Functions Like A GPS] Published by Forbes, June 29, 2017, retrieved August 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is the technology-enabled [[automation]] of complex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation] Published by Gartner&lt;/ref&gt; [[business process]]es. It can streamline a business for simplicity, achieve [[digital transformation]], increase [[service quality]], improve service delivery or contain costs. It consists of integrating applications, restructuring labor resources and using [[application software|software applications]] throughout the organization. [[Robotic process automation]] is an emerging field within BPA and uses [[artificial intelligence]].

==Deployment of a BPA==
BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including [[marketing]], [[sales]] and [[workflow]]. Toolsets vary in sophistication, but there is an increasing trend towards the use of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured [[data set]]s, interact with human beings, and adapt to new types of problems without human-guided training. BPA providers tend to focus on different industry sectors but their underlying approach tends to be similar in that they will attempt to provide the shortest route to automation by exploiting the [[user interface]] layer rather than going deeply into the application code or databases sitting behind them. They also simplify their own interface to the extent that these tools can be used directly by non-technically qualified staff. The main advantage of these toolsets is therefore their speed of deployment, the drawback is that it brings yet another IT supplier to the organization.

The market is, however, evolving in this area.  In order to automate these processes, connectors are needed to fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A [[process driven messaging service]] is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a process driven messaging platform. Process driven messaging service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.

==A business process management implementation==
A [[business process management]] system is quite different from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation on the back of a BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.

==Deployment of robotic process automation==
The practice of performing [[robotic process automation]] results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization's environment. These software agents, or robots, are deployed to perform pre-defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes. Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation. Robotic process automation is the leading gateway for the adoption of artificial intelligence in business environments.

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

'''Business simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[business]] training, education or analysis. It can be [[scenario]]-based or [[Number|numeric]]-based.

Most business simulations are used for business acumen training and development. Learning objectives include: strategic thinking, decision making, problem solving, financial analysis, market analysis, operations, teamwork and leadership.&lt;ref name="bizsims"&gt;[http://www.bizsims.edu.au/ Online Business Simulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The business gaming community seems lately to have adopted the term '''business simulation game''' instead of just '''gaming''' or just '''simulation'''. The word '''simulation''' is sometimes considered too mechanistic for educational purposes. '''Simulation''' also refers to activities where an optimum for some problem is searched for, while this is not usually the aim of an educational game. On the other hand, the word '''game''' can imply time wasting, not taking things too seriously and engaging in an exercise designed purely for fun. The concept of '''simulation gaming''' seems to offer the right combination and balance between the two.&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"&gt;Lainema (2003). Enhancing Organizational Business Process Perception – Experiences from Constructing and Applying a Dynamic Business Simulation Game. Turku School of Economics, Series A-5:2003. {{ISBN|951-564-139-X}}. Online: http://info.tse.fi/julkaisut/vk/Ae5_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation gaming is also the term that the educational gaming community has adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblat, Cathy Stein (1988). Designing Games and Simulations: An Illustrated Handbook. Sage Publications, Newbury Park&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games and business simulation games ==
Partly, the terminology of [[business simulation game]]s is not well established. The most common term used is '''[[business game]]''' but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments.

Klabbers (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 16-33&lt;/ref&gt; notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent:&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). Using Management Games. 2nd edition, Gower Press, Aldershot, Hampshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;
* human, humanly controlled, opponents, whose actions have an effect upon each other and upon the environment,
* an emphasis on competitiveness and winning,
* an emphasis on pleasure, humour and enjoyment,
* a repetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering a result, allowing the hope of improvement and 'doing better next time'.

Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"&gt;Jaques, David (1995). Games, Simulations and Case Studies – A Review. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 21-38&lt;/ref&gt; Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2001). Bridging information &amp; knowledge society: potentials of gaming. In Rahnu, L. (ed.) Bridging the Information and Knowledge Societies. Tartu University Press, Tartu, Estonia&lt;/ref&gt; In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2003). Interactive Learning of What? In Percival, Godfrey, Laybourn and Murray (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Vol. 11, pp. 257-266. Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, Tomoaki and Tsuchiya, Shigehisa (1999). The Unique Contribution of Gaming/Simulation: Towards Establishment of the Discipline. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 46-57&lt;/ref&gt; note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association ('''ISAGA''') was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Joseph and Crookall, David (1998). Developing a Scientific Knowledge of Simulation/Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development.

In most cases, the terms '''business (simulation) game''' and '''management (simulation) game''' can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"&gt;Greenlaw, Paul S., Herron, Lowell W. and Rawdon, Richard H. (1962). Business Simulation in Industrial and University Education. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; determine a business game (or business simulation) as ''a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation''. The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay W. (1961). Industrial Dynamics. The M.I.T. Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, London&lt;/ref&gt; and Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, New York&lt;/ref&gt; do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"/&gt; determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keys | first1 = Bernard | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = Joseph | year = 1990 | title = The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 307–336 | doi=10.1177/014920639001600205}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.

Gredler&lt;ref&gt;Gredler, Margaret E. (1996). Educational Games and Simulations: A Technology in Search of a (Research) Paradigm. In Jonassen, David H. (ed.) Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology. Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; divides experiential simulations into the following four categories:
# Data management simulations,
# Diagnostic simulations,
# Crisis management simulations, and
# Social-process simulations.
Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal.

Business strategy games are intended to enhance students' decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn and Sigelman, Lee (1991). Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction. Sage Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company's share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player's initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative.

In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions – on price, advertising, production targets, etc. – about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"&gt;Ju, Edward and Wagner, Christian (1997). Personal Computer Games: Their Structure, Principles, and Applicability for Training. The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 78-92&lt;/ref&gt; mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, operations, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods.

According to Senge and Lannon&lt;ref&gt;Senge, P. M. and Lannon, C. (1997). Managerial Microworlds. Technology Review, Vol. 93, Issue 5, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt; in '''managerial microworlds''' – like business simulation games – unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such "virtual worlds" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts.

Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of '''(a)''' a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and '''(b)''' the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports – for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports – at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003).&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess.&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"/&gt; In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Dickinson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faria | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Dickinson | first2 = John R. | year = 1994 | title = Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training | url = | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1108/02621719410050183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. R. (1959). Learning from Experience in Business Decision Games. California Management Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 92-107&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"/&gt; state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing.

According to Naylor,&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Faria, Anthony J. (1990). Business Simulation Games after Thirty Years: Current Usage Levels in the United States. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 36-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRaith | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Goeldner | first2 = C. R. | year = 1962 | title = A Survey of Marketing Games | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 26 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. G., and Gray, C. F. (1969). Business Games Handbook. American Management Association, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves&lt;ref&gt;Horn, R. E., and Cleaves, A. (1980). The Guide to Simulation/Games for Education and Training. Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A.J. (1989). Business Gaming: Current Usage Levels. Management Development Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 58-66&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"/&gt;

At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games.

The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors:&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Thomas F. (1995). Strategy Support during a Business Game using an Expert System. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 87-101&lt;/ref&gt; the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, John R. and Faria, A. J. (1995). Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training and a Demonstration. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt; state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.

Larsen and Lomi&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik and Lomi, Alessandro (1999). System Dynamics and the 'New Technology' for Organizational Decisions: From Mapping and Simulation to Learning and Understanding. European Management Journal, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt; describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry's problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference – or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted:
# from predicting the future, to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today, and
# from designing the best strategy, to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold, or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive.

In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as "[[experiential learning]]".  By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills  with the softer – interpersonal – skills required for effective leadership development.

In a [[business game]] or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to [[role-play]] simulations.

==Numeric simulations ==
A numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes. In a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers. The decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs, e.g. price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e.g. an [[income statement]], a [[balance sheet]] and a [[cash flow statement]]. [[Feedback]] is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals, such as when a year has passed. Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors.

== Types of business simulation games ==
Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs,&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 23-35&lt;/ref&gt; which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Description of alternatives
|-
| Functional or Total enterprise || Designed to focus specifically on problems of decision-making as seen in one functional area; OR
Designed to give participants experience in making decisions at a top executive level and in which decisions from one functional area interact with those made in other areas of a firm.
|-
| Competitive or Non-competitive || Whether the decisions or participants influence the results of other participants or not.
|-
| Interactive or Noninteractive || In an interactive game participants respond to the questions at the computer, receive an immediate response, and then submit additional decisions. In a noninteractive game decisions are submitted to the game administrator.
|-
| Industry specific or Generic || In an industry specific game the authors attempt to replicate closely the actual industry. In generic games only general business relationships are replicated.
|-

== The simulation gaming process ==
Business simulation game developers regard their artifacts to be learning environments. When arguing for this, they most often refer to [[David A. Kolb|David A. Kolb's]] influential work in the field of [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, David (1984). Experiential Learning: Experience the Source of Learning and Development. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Englewood Cliffs&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decades ideas from [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and authentic e-learning have also provided new perspectives for considering the role of business simulations in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lainema, T. (2009). Perspective Making – Constructivism as a Meaning Structure for Simulation Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Theory, Practice and Research, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 48-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="authenticlearning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://authenticlearning.info/# |title=Authentic e-Learning |access-date=2015-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313190110/http://authenticlearning.info/# |archive-date=2015-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The activities carried out during a simulation game training session are:&lt;ref&gt;Villegas, Jaime (1997). Simulation Supported Industrial Training: A Method for Increasing the Competence of People in Companies. Saunders, Peter and Cox, Benita (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Volume 5: Research into Simulations in Education. Kogan Page, London, pp. 144-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical instruction: the teacher goes through certain relevant aspects of a theory and participants can intervene with questions and comments.
* Introduction to the game: the participants are told how to operate the computer and how to play the game.
* Playing the game: participants get the opportunity to practice their knowledge and skills by changing different parameters of the game and reflecting on the possible consequences of these changes. Permanent contact with the participants is advisable, as well as keeping the training going to maintain a positive atmosphere and to secure that the participants feel engaged.
* Group discussions: Each of the participants is given a possibility to present and compare their results from the game with the results of others. The participants are encouraged to present their results to others. The teacher should continually look for new ways of enriching the discussions and to help the participants to find the connection between the game results and the problems in real world. The quality of this group discussion plays a relevant role in the training as it will affect the participants' transfer of knowledge and skills into the real world.

The last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing. Debriefing is the most important part of the simulation/gaming experience.&lt;ref&gt;Crookall, David (1995). Preface: Debriefing the Profession and Professionalizing Debrifing. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 7-12&lt;/ref&gt; We all learn from experience, but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost. Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"/&gt;

Thiagarajan&lt;ref&gt;Thiagarajan, Sivasailam (1995). Guidelines for Conducting a Debriefing Session and for Developing a Debriefing Guide. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt; lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements:
# How do you feel? Gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest.
# What happened? Makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase.
# What did you learn? Encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses. Ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles.
# How does this relate to the real world? Encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants' real world workplace.
# What if…? Encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts.
# What next? Participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace.

Van Ments&lt;ref&gt;van Ments, Morry (1996). Role Playing: Playing a Part or a Mirror to Meaning. In Saunders, Percival and Vartiainen (eds.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 4: Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning. Kogan Page, London&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, James W. (1990). What is Expeiential Learning? In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome.
The importance of reflection, debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes, pedagogy and assessment tasks. Student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vos|first1=Lynn|title=Simulation games in business and marketing education: How educators assess student learning from simulations|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|date=2015|volume=13|page=16|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811715000026|accessdate=23 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Online Business Simulations Project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching has developed a range of resources to help educators embed simulations into their classes.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt;

'''The Centre for India &amp; Global Business''' ('''CIGB''') was launched in March 2009 as part of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]], to support the university’s growing engagement with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-india.org/ Cambridge-India Partnership].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a research centre and an engagement platform CIGB is dedicated to the study of India's rapidly expanding role in the global [[knowledge economy]].

==History==
CIGB was established with initial funding from the [[BP]] foundation. The academic director of CIGB is [[Jaideep Prabhu|Professor Jaideep Prabhu]], the first [[University of Cambridge|Jawaharlal Nehru Professor of Indian Business and Enterprise]] at the University of Cambridge, who took up the post in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2008050202 Appointment of the first Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at Cambridge], press release from Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; The founding Executive Director of CIGB was [[Navi Radjou]], who served between January 2009 and June 2011. The Centre has 14 other academic members, including [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] faculty and PhD students.

==Research activities==
CIGB conducts research in collaboration with a global network of academic partners around three complementary themes:
*''India as a global innovation hub'': how and why firms from around the world are increasingly locating their global R&amp;D and innovation activities in India
*''Indian firms going global'': how Indian firms are going global on the back of innovation in India or in order to become more innovative relative to global competitors
*''Co-innovation with the'' [[bottom of the pyramid|''bottom of the socio-economic pyramid'']] (mass markets): how multinational and Indian firms are engaging those who live on less than $5 a day as value-adding partners through innovative products, services and business models.
A major issue underlying these three themes is how India is emerging as a learning laboratory for affordable and sustainable innovation to deal with the global challenges of scarcity and diversity.

The academic projects undertaken by CIGB involve field research in India which CIGB-related faculty visit frequently in order to collect data and conduct interviews with local policy-makers, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|title=Cambridge-India Activity: : University of Cambridge: Cambridge and India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831222345/http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|archivedate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIGB produces case studies that feed into its outreach and networks activities. Its research has been featured in leading newspapers and magazines worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation The New Shape of Innovation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725141517/http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |date=July 25, 2010 }}, Global Intelligence for the CIO, 19 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and networks==
CIGB also hosts conferences and seminars that bring together academics, corporate leaders, and policy-makers from all over the world to discuss and disseminate latest research findings as well as policy and industry best practices. These events are hosted both in Cambridge as well as in major Indian cities. For instance, in March 2009, Professor Jaideep Prabhu, Director of CIGB, delivered his inaugural lecture in [[New Delhi]], which was chaired by Mr [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Deputy Chairman of the Indian Planning Commission. In May 2009, CIGB hosted in [[Cambridge]] a major conference titled “''Innovation in India and China: How to Create Value from Emerging Markets'',” which explored the rise of [[India]] and [[China]] as both fast-growing global markets and world-class sources of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009050105|title=Latest news|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090518_innovation/index.html Proceedings from the “Innovation in India and China” conference], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, CIGB has also hosted a number of speakers including: [[Nandan Nilekani]], Chairman of the new [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) and former Co-Chairman of [[Infosys Technologies]] (April 2009); former Indian president [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam|Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]](June 2009);&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge-India Partnership, Cambridge-India Activitiy, September 2008 onwards, University of Cambridge [http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090603_abdul_kalam.html Creative Leadership in the Global Knowledge Economy], Dr Abdul Kalam’s lecture at Judge Business School, 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravi Kant (Indian executive)|Ravi Kant]], Vice-Chairman of [[Tata Motors]]; and Dr [[Ramesh Mashelkar]], former Director General of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], who delivered the inaugural BP Annual Lecture at Cambridge Judge Business Business on 21 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2010/100621_mashelkar.html Visit of Dr R.A. Mashelkar to Cambridge], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online engagement==
In November 2009, at the [[World Economic Forum]]’s India Economic Summit, CIGB launched Indovations.Net, an interactive, multimedia website that educates users worldwide about innovations in India across five domains: business, social, energy/environment, art/culture, and science &amp; technology. This website addresses a fundamental questions such as, What can the world learn from India-inspired innovation — or [[Indovation]] — and how people can benefit from it, etc.

Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou write [[blog]] posts on innovation, [[emerging markets]], and global leadership on the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/search/radjou%25252520prabhu/ Blog posts by Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou], [http://hbr.org/ HBR.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication quotient''', '''communication intelligence''', or '''CQ''' is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] that [[communication]] is a [[behaviour]] based skill that can be measured and trained.  CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another.  The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals.  The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of [[Information Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 at [[TED conference|TED]] Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|url=http://www.tedwomen.aol.com/2010/10/03/clare-munn/|work=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|publisher=TEDWomen|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of [[IQ]] as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by [[Howard Gardner]] with his [[Theory of multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|url=https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465025102|work=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|publisher=New York|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gardner's view, traditional types of [[intelligence]], such as IQ, fail to fully explain [[cognitive ability]].  The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], a trend led by [[Daniel Goleman]]’s [[emotional intelligence]] and social intelligence.

==Definition==
''[[The Times of India]]'' in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shift from IQ|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/A-Shift-from-IQ/articleshow/1010684.cms|work=A Shift from IQ|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=Improving Your Communication Quotient|url=http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/CQ.htm.|work=Improving Your Communication Quotient|publisher=Expressions of Excellence|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Clare Munn and [[Maria Bello]] defined CQ as "Expressive &amp; Receptive Intelligence" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Social Media's Value Proposition Might Just be CQ|url=http://claremunn.com/2009/04/cq-social-medias-value-proposition/|work=CQ: Expressive and Receptive Intelligence|publisher=Clare Munn|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in ''The CQ Manifesto'' defined CQ as  "saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Institute - What is CQ?|url=http://www.cqinstitute.com/CQ/what_is_cq.htm|work=The CQ Manifesto - Communication Intelligence: the 5 professional personas that will transform your work life and super-charge your organisation|publisher=CQ Institute|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals.  Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks.  The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Strategy}}

'''Competitive intelligence''' ('''CI''') is the action of defining, gathering, analyzing, and distributing [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] about products, customers, [[competitor]]s, and any aspect of the environment needed to support executives and [[manager]]s in strategic [[decision making]] for an organization.

CI means understanding and learning what is happening in the world outside the business to increase one's [[competitivity]]. It means learning as much as possible, as soon as possible, about one's external environment including one's industry in general and relevant competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/competitive-intelligence |title=Competitive Intelligence Definition &amp;#124; Small Business Encyclopedia |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key points:
# Competitive intelligence is a legal business practice, as opposed to [[industrial espionage]], which is illegal.&lt;ref name="SCIP Code of Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Code of Ethics for CI Professionals|url=https://www.scip.org/CodeOfEthics.php|publisher=Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is a process involved in gathering information, converting it into intelligence and then using it in decision making. Some CI professionals erroneously emphasise that if the intelligence gathered is not usable or actionable, it is not intelligence.&lt;ref name=mcgonagle&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGonagle|first1=John J. and Carolyn M. Vella|title=The Manager's Guide to Competitive Intelligence|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport CT|isbn=978-1567205718|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTVN4YubwVwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of CI regards it as the organizational function responsible for the early identification of [[risk management|risks]] and [[Opportunity management|opportunities]] in the market before they become ''obvious'' ("early signal analysis"). This definition focuses attention on the difference between dissemination of widely available factual information (such as [[market statistics]], [[financial report]]s, newspaper clippings) performed by functions such as libraries and information centers, and competitive intelligence which is a ''perspective'' on developments and events aimed at yielding a competitive edge.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben. "The Future of Competitive Intelligence: Contest for the Profession's Soul", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 2008, 11(5), 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CI is often viewed as synonymous with [[competitor analysis]], but competitive intelligence is more than analyzing competitors; it embraces the entire environment and stakeholders: customers, competitors, distributors, technologies, and macroeconomic data.

== Historic development ==
CI literature is best exemplified by the bibliographies that were published in the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]]' academic journal ''The Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management''.&lt;ref name="Dishman, Fleisher, &amp; Knip, 2003"&gt;Dishman, P., Fleisher, C. S., and V. Knip. "Chronological and Categorized Bibliography of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 1 (1997-2003), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 1(1), 16–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S., Wright, Sheila, and R.

Dishman.

Dishman, and C.S. Fleisher. "Bibliography and Assessment of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 3 (The Earliest Writings-1989), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 2003, 1(3), 10–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Although elements of [[organizational intelligence]] collection have been a part of business for many years, the history of competitive intelligence arguably began in the U.S. in the 1970s, although the literature on the field pre-dates this time by at least several decades.&lt;ref name="Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003" /&gt; In 1980, [[Michael E. Porter|Michael Porter]] published the study ''Competitive-Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors'' which is widely viewed as the foundation of modern competitive intelligence. This has since been extended most notably by the pair of [[Craig Fleisher]] and [[Babette Bensoussan]], who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added 48 commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner's tool box.&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and Babette E. Bensoussan. ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2007"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and Babette E. Bensoussan. Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methods, FT Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence.&lt;ref name="Fuld, 1985"&gt;Fuld, Leonard M., ''Competitor Intelligence: How to Get It, How to Use It''. NY: Wiley, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to 1988, when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function, which was then adopted widely by US companies.&lt;ref name="Gilad &amp; Gilad, 1988"&gt;Gilad, [[Benjamin Gilad]] and Tamar Gilad. ''The Business Intelligence System''. NY: American Management Association, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional certification program (CIP) was created in 1996 with the establishment of The [[Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.

In 1986 the ''Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals'' (SCIP) was founded in the United States and grew in the late 1990s to around 6,000 members worldwide, mainly in the United States and Canada, but with large numbers especially in the UK and Australia. Due to financial difficulties in 2009, the organization merged with Frost &amp; Sullivan under the Frost &amp; Sullivan Institute. SCIP has since been renamed "Strategic &amp; Competitive Intelligence Professionals" to emphasise the strategic nature of the subject, and also to refocus the organisation's general approach, while keeping the existing SCIP brandname and logo. A number of efforts have been made to discuss the field's advances in post-secondary (university) education, covered by several authors including Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher,&lt;ref name="Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher, 2003"&gt;Blenkhorn, D. and C. S. Fleisher (2003). "Teaching CI to three diverse groups: Undergraduates, MBAs, and Executives", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 6(4), 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleisher,&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Education, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, C. S. (2003). "Competitive Intelligence Education: Competencies, Sources and Trends," ''Information Management Journal'', March/April, 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuld,&lt;ref&gt;Fuld, 2006{{Specify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott,&lt;ref name="Prescott, 1999"&gt;Prescott, J. (1999). "Debunking the Academic Abstinence Myth of Competitive Intelligence", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 2(4).&lt;/ref&gt; and McGonagle.&lt;ref name="McGonagle, 2003"&gt;McGonagle, J. (2003). "Bibliography: Education in CI," ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 6(4), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the general view would be that competitive intelligence concepts can be readily found and taught in many business schools around the globe, there are still relatively few dedicated academic programs, majors, or degrees in the field, a concern to academics in the field who would like to see it further researched.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Education, 2003" /&gt; These issues were widely discussed by over a dozen knowledgeable individuals in a special edition of the Competitive Intelligence Magazine that was dedicated to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;(Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 2003, 6(4), July/August)&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a Specialized Master in Economic Intelligence and Knowledge Management was created in 1995 within the CERAM Business School, now [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926132909/http://www.skema-bs.fr/faculte-recherche/centre-intelligence-economique-et-influence SKEMA Business School], in Paris, with the objective of delivering a full and professional training in Economic Intelligence. A Centre for Global Intelligence and Influence was created in September 2011 in the same School.

On the other hand, practitioners and companies regard professional accreditation as especially important in this field.&lt;ref name="Gilad and Herring, 2001"&gt;Gilad, Ben and Jan Herring. "CI Certification - Do We Need It?", Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 2001, 4(2), 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, SCIP recognized the [[Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence]]'s CIP certification process as its global, dual-level (CIP-I and CIP-II) certification program.

Global developments have also been uneven in competitive intelligence.&lt;ref name="Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher, 2005"&gt;Blenkhorn, D. and C.S. Fleisher. Competitive Intelligence and Global Business. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several academic journals, particularly the ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'' in its third volume, provided coverage of the field's global development.&lt;ref&gt;(''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', volume 2, numbers 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1997 the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|École de guerre économique|fr}} (''School of economic warfare'') was founded in Paris, [[France]]. It is the first European institution which teaches the tactics of economic warfare within a globalizing world. In [[Germany]], competitive intelligence was unattended until the early 1990s. The term "competitive intelligence" first appeared in German literature in 1997. In 1995 a German SCIP chapter was founded, which is now second in terms of membership in Europe. In summer 2004 the Institute for Competitive Intelligence was founded, which provides a postgraduate certification program for Competitive Intelligence Professionals. [[Japan]] is currently the only country that officially maintains an economic intelligence agency ([[JETRO]]). It was founded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ([[MITI]]) in 1958.

Accepting the importance of competitive intelligence, major multinational corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[Johnson and Johnson]], have created formal CI units.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Importantly, organizations execute competitive intelligence activities not only as a safeguard to protect against market threats and changes, but also as a method for finding new opportunities and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calof|first=Jonathan L|author2=Sheila Wright|title=Competitive intelligence: A practitioner, academic and inter-disciplinary perspective|journal=European Journal of Marketing|year=2008|volume=42|issue=7/8|pages=717–730|doi=10.1108/03090560810877114}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 7, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations use competitive intelligence to compare themselves to other organizations ("competitive benchmarking"), to identify risks and opportunities in their markets, and to pressure-test their plans against market response (business wargaming),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://competitive-intelligence.mirum.net/competitive-intelligence-methods/what-is-a-business-wargame.html|title=What Is A Business Wargame?|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enable them to make informed decisions. Most firms today realize the importance of knowing what their competitors are doing and how the industry is changing, and the information gathered allows organizations to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

One of the major activities involved in corporate competitive intelligence is use of [[ratio analysis]], using [[key performance indicator]]s (KPI). Organizations compare annual reports of their competitors on certain KPI and ratios, which are intrinsic to their industry. This helps them track their performance, vis-a-vis their competitors.

The actual importance of these categories of information to an organization depends on the contestability of its markets, the organizational culture, the personality and biases of its top decision makers, and the reporting structure of competitive intelligence within the company.

''Strategic Intelligence'' (SI) focuses on the longer term, looking at issues affecting a company's competitiveness over the course of a couple of years. The actual time horizon for SI ultimately depends on the industry and how quickly it's changing. The general questions that SI answers are, ‘Where should we as a company be in X years?' and 'What are the strategic risks and opportunities facing us?' This type of intelligence work involves among others the identification of weak signals and application of methodology and process called Strategic Early Warning (SEW), first introduced by Gilad,&lt;ref name="Gilad, 2001"&gt;Gilad, Ben (2001). "Industry Risk Management: CI's Next Step", Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 4 (3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilad, Early Warning, 2003"&gt;Gilad, Ben. Early Warning. NY: American Management Association, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilad, 2006"&gt;Gilad, Ben (2006). "Early Warning Revisited", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 9(2), March–April.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Steven Shaker and Victor Richardson,&lt;ref name="Shaker and Richardson, 2004"&gt;Shaker, Steven and Richardson, Victor (2004). "Putting the System Back into Early Warning". ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 7(3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandro Comai and Joaquin Tena,&lt;ref name="Comai and Tena, 2007"&gt;Comai, Alessandro and Tena, Joaquin (2007). "Early Warning Systems for your Competitive Landscape", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 10(3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comai and Tena, 2006"&gt;Comai, Alessandro and Tena, Joaquin (2006). "Mapping and Anticipating the Competitive Landscape", ''Emecom Ediciones'', Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. According to Gilad, 20% of the work of competitive intelligence practitioners should be dedicated to strategic early identification of weak signals within a SEW framework.

''Tactical Intelligence'': the focus is on providing information designed to improve shorter-term decisions, most often related with the intent of growing market share or revenues. Generally, it is the type of information that you would need to support the sales process in an organization. It investigates various aspects of a product/product line marketing:

* Product – what are people selling?
* Price – what price are they charging?
* Promotion – what activities are they conducting for promoting this product?
* Place – where are they selling this product?
* Other – sales force structure, clinical trial design, technical issues, etc.

With the right amount of information, organizations can avoid unpleasant surprises by anticipating competitors' moves and decreasing response time. Examples of competitive intelligence research is evident in daily newspapers, such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', and ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. Major airlines change hundreds of fares daily in response to competitors' tactics. They use information to plan their own marketing, pricing, and production strategies.

Resources, such as the Internet, have made gathering information on competitors easy. With a click of a button, analysts can discover future trends and market requirements. However competitive intelligence is much more than this, as the ultimate aim is to lead to [[competitive advantage]]. As the Internet is mostly public domain material, information gathered is less likely to result in insights that will be unique to the company. In fact there is a risk that information gathered from the Internet will be misinformation and mislead users, so competitive intelligence researchers are often wary of using such information.

As a result, although the Internet is viewed as a key source, most CI professionals should spend their time and budget gathering intelligence using primary research—networking with industry experts, from [[trade show]]s and conferences, from their own customers and suppliers, and so on. Where the Internet is used, it is to gather sources for primary research as well as information on what the company says about itself and its online presence (in the form of links to other companies, its strategy regarding search engines and online advertising, mentions in discussion forums and on blogs, etc.). Also, important are online subscription databases and news aggregation sources which have simplified the secondary source collection process. Social media sources are also becoming important—providing potential interviewee names, as well as opinions and attitudes, and sometimes breaking news (e.g., via [[Twitter]]).

Organizations must be careful not to spend too much time and effort on old competitors without realizing the existence of any new competitors. Knowing more about your competitors will allow your business to grow and succeed. The practice of competitive intelligence is growing every year, and most companies and business students now realize the importance of knowing their competitors.

According to Arjan Singh and Andrew Beurschgens in their 2006 article in the ''Competitive Intelligence Review'', there are four stages of development of a competitive intelligence capability with a firm. It starts with "stick fetching", where a CI department is very reactive, up to "world class", where it is completely integrated in the decision-making process.

The technical advances in massive parallel processing offered by the [[Hadoop]] "[[big data]]" architecture has allowed the creation of multiple platforms for [[named-entity recognition]] such as the [[Apache Project]]s [[OpenNLP]] and [[Apache Stanbol]]. The former includes pre-trained statistical parsers that can discern elements key to establishing trends and evaluating competitive position and responding appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augmentedintel.com/wordpress/index.php/augmented-intel-free-online-analytics-applications-for-corporate-intelligence/working-net-entity-extractor-using-opennlp-models/|title=Working entity extractor with openNLP models for name extraction|last=Krapohl|first=Don|publisher=AugmentedIntel|date=14 April 2013|website=AugmentedIntel|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public information mining from ''SEC.gov'', Federal Contract Awards, social media ([[Twitter]], [[Reddit]], [[Facebook]], and others), vendors, and competitor websites now permit real-time counterintelligence as a strategy for horizontal and vertical market expansion and product positioning. This occurs in an automated fashion on massive marketplaces such as [[Amazon.com]] and their classification and prediction of product associations and purchase probability.

Competitive intelligence has been influenced by national [[strategic intelligence]]. Although national intelligence was researched 50 years ago, competitive intelligence was introduced during the 1990s. Competitive-intelligence professionals can learn from national-intelligence experts, especially in the analysis of complex situations.&lt;ref&gt;Barnea, A., (2010), "Intelligence Failures: Competitive Intelligence and Strategic Surprises", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', Vol. 13. No. 3, July/September.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive intelligence may be confused with (or seen to overlap) [[environmental scanning]], [[business intelligence]] and [[market research]].&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and David Blenkhorn. Controversies in Competitive Intelligence: The Enduring Issues. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Fleisher]]&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003" /&gt; questions the appropriateness of the term, comparing it to business intelligence, competitor intelligence, knowledge management, market intelligence, marketing research and strategic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. (2003). "Should the Field be Called 'Competitive Intelligence?' pp. 56-69 in Fleisher, Craig S. and David Blenkhorn [eds.], ''Controversies in Competitive Intelligence: The Enduring Issues''. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleisher&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}} suggests that business intelligence has two forms. Its narrow (contemporary) form is more focused on information technology and internal focus than CI, while its broader (historical) definition is more inclusive than CI. Knowledge management (KM), when improperly achieved, is seen as an information-technology driven organizational practice relying on data mining, corporate intranets and mapping organizational assets to make it accessible to organization members for decision-making. CI shares some aspects of KM; they are human-intelligence- and experience-based for a more-sophisticated qualitative analysis.&amp;nbsp;km is essential for effective change. A key effective factor is a powerful, dedicated IT system executing the full intelligence cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnea|first=Avner|title=Intelligence Solutions through the Use of Expert Tools|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=May–June 2009|volume=12|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence (MI) is industry-targeted intelligence developed in real-time aspects of competitive events taking place among the four Ps of the [[marketing mix]] (pricing, place, promotion and product) in the product (or service) marketplace to better understand the market's attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Skyrme, 1989"&gt;Skyrme, D. J. (1989). "The Planning and Marketing of the Market Intelligence Function," ''Marketing Intelligence and Planning'', 7(1/2), 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt; A time-based competitive tactic, MI is used by marketing and sales managers to respond to consumers more quickly in the marketplace. Fleisher suggests it is not distributed as widely as some forms of CI, which are also distributed to non-marketing decision-makers.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}} Market intelligence has a shorter time horizon than other intelligence areas, and is measured in days, weeks, or (in slower-moving industries) months.

Market research is a tactical, method-driven field consisting of neutral, primary research of customer data (beliefs and perceptions) gathered in surveys or focus groups, and is analyzed with statistical-research techniques.&lt;ref name="Sharp, 2000"&gt;Sharp, S. (2000). "Truth or Consequences: 10 Myths that Cripple Competitive Intelligence", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 3(1), 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; CI draws on a wider variety (primary and secondary) of sources from a wider range of stakeholders (suppliers, competitors, distributors, substitutes and media) to answer existing questions, raise new ones and guide action.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

Ben Gilad and Jan Herring lay down a set of prerequisites defining CI, distinguishing it from other information-rich disciplines such as market research or business development. They show that a common body of knowledge and a unique set of tools (key intelligence topics, [[business war games]] and [[blindspots analysis]]) distinguish CI; while other sensory activities in a commercial firm focus on ''one'' segment of the market (customers, suppliers or acquisition targets), CI synthesizes data from all high-impact players (HIP).&lt;ref name="Gilad and Herring, 2001"/&gt;

Gilad later focused his delineation of CI on the difference between information and intelligence. According to him, the common denominator among organizational sensory functions (whether they are called market research, business intelligence or market intelligence) is that they deliver information rather than intelligence. Intelligence, says Gilad, is a perspective on facts rather than the facts themselves. Unique among corporate functions, competitive intelligence has a perspective of risks and opportunities for a firm's performance; as such, it (not information activities) is part of an organization's risk-management activity.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, B. (2008) "The Future of Competitive Intelligence: Contest for the Profession's Soul", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 11 (5), 21–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
Ethics has been a long-held issue of discussion among CI practitioners.&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003" /&gt; The questions revolve around what is and is not allowable in terms of CI activity. A number of scholarly treatments have been generated on this topic, most prominently addressed through Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals publications.&lt;ref name="Competitive Intelligence Foundation, 2006"&gt;Competitive Intelligence Foundation (2006). ''Competitive Intelligence Ethics: Navigating the Gray Zone''. D. Fehringer and Hohhof, B.[Eds], Alexandria, VA: Competitive Intelligence Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Competitive Intelligence Ethics: Navigating the Gray Zone'' provides nearly twenty separate views about ethics in CI, as well as another 10 codes used by various individuals or organizations.&lt;ref name="Competitive Intelligence Foundation, 2006" /&gt; Combining that with the over two dozen scholarly articles or studies found within the various CI bibliographic entries,&lt;ref&gt;Knip, Fleisher, &amp; Dishman, 2003{{Specify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.telfer.uottawa.ca/ci-wiki/index.php/Ethics_in_Competitive_Intelligence#.22The_Bible_of_BI_Ethics.22 |title=Ethics in Competitive Intelligence, University of Ottawa |publisher=Wiki.telfer.uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that no shortage of study has gone into better classifying, understanding and addressing CI ethics.

Competitive information may be obtained from public or subscription sources, from networking with competitor staff or customers, disassembly of competitor products or from field research interviews. Competitive intelligence research is distinguishable from [[industrial espionage]], as CI practitioners generally abide by local legal guidelines and ethical business norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhesq.com/CI/SCIP%20EEA%20Policy%20Analysis.pdf |title=white pages |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">'''A consignment agreement''' is an agreement between a consignee and consignor for the storage, transfer, sale or resale and use of the commodity. The consignee may take goods from the [[consignment stock]] for use or resale subject to payment to the consignor agreeably to the terms bargained in the consignment agreement. The unsold goods will normally be returned by the consignee to the consignor.

==Consignment and distribution agreements==
It may be accompanied by a consignment agreement ([[Franchising]], distributorship or [[OEM]]).
Goods are stored at the premises of the [[distributor]], or premises of a [[Party (law)|third party]], at distributor's disposal, but remain the property of the [[export]]er.

This agreement decreases the exporter's risk because he remains the owner of the commodities in storage.  The distributor does not need to pay until he has sold the commodities, so he improves his [[cash flow]]. 
Both parties must ensure that the consignment agreement is formulated very carefully, so no room for doubt remains with regard to third parties, specifically the distributor's [[creditor]]s in case of his bankruptcy. 
The distributor and the exporter have incompatible interests. The distributor's interest will be to increase the amount of the stock in consignment because this has no effect on his cash situation. Therefore the parties should agree on reasonable stock rolling adapted to the [[Demand (economics)|market demand]], and consider how quickly the exporter may produce and deliver additional goods in order to avoid stock disruption.

Fulfillment of certain conditions is requested by the customs and VAT authorities. Due to the European VAT rules, it is easier to have a consignment stock between EU countries. The distributor is required to keep accurate accounts, but dispensable to have a [[bonded warehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Didier  |last=Rigault |year=2010 |title= International Business Agreements | ISBN =978-82-991430-9-7 | page=83 |publisher=The International Business Law Group |location=Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  [[accounting]], the '''convention of conservatism''', also known as the '''doctrine of prudence''', is a policy of anticipating possible future losses but not future gains. This policy tends to understate rather than overstate net assets and net income, and therefore lead companies to . When given a choice between several outcomes where the probabilities of occurrence are equally likely, you should recognize that transaction resulting in the lower amount of profit, or at least the deferral of a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/14/the-conservatism-principle}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref name="Ahmed2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naseem Ahmed|title=Financial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmiXKF8dRcIC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0993-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In accounting, it states that when choosing between two solutions, the one that will be least likely to overstate assets and income should be selected. Essentially, "expected losses are losses but expected gains are not gains".

The conservatism principle is the foundation for the lower of cost or market rule, which states that you should record inventory at the lower of either its acquisition cost or its current market value.

Conservatism plays an important role in a number of accounting rules, including the allowance for [[doubtful debt]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Scott B.|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaotao (kelvin)|date=2010-06-01|title=The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, Conservatism, and Earnings Management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=565–601|doi=10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x|issn=1475-679X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[lower of cost or market]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/lower-of-cost-or-market/explanation|title=Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) {{!}} Explanation {{!}} AccountingCoach|website=AccountingCoach.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], [[Putting-out system|cottage]] or household industries hold an important position in rural set-up. Most villages are self-sufficient in the basic necessities of life. They have their own [[carpentry|carpenter]]s, cobblers, potters, craftsmen and [[cotton]] [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s. Many families depend on cottage industries for income.

Cottage industries have also gained immense importance in cities and towns. There is a great demand for hand-woven [carpet]s, [[Embroidery|embroidered work]], [[brass]]ware, [[Carpet|rug]]s and traditional [[bangle]]s. These are also considered important [[export]] items and are in good demand in international markets.

== Why it is important to encourage cottage and small-scale industries ==

There are meagre resources to develop large-scale industries. However, a program for developing and promoting small-scale industries both in rural and urban areas is more feasible figure 1 shows the advantages of establishing such industries.

[[File:Advantages of estabishing small scale industries.png|center|frame|alt=table|advantages of establishing small-scale cottage industries in Pakistan]]

# Cottage and small-scale industries are [[Labor intensity|labor-intensive]] and provide employment to 80% of the industrial [[labor force]]. This reduces the [[unemployment]] and offers opportunities for [[self-employment]].
# Traditionally, women are not encouraged to work outside their homes. Cottage or small-scale industries like carpet-weaving, [[Candle|candle-making]] and [[handicraft]]s can be established in houses and women can be gainfully employed. This increases the active labor force.
# These industries also meet the local demands for industrial goods, and save foreign exchange spent in imports.
# There is a demand for rugs, carpets, brassware, handicrafts and embroidered work in the International market. These goods provide 30% of the export receipts of the [[secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]].
# When people are employed gainfully in villages, the [[human migration|migration]] of people from rural to urban areas will reduce. The acute problems of [[House|housing]], [[sanitation]], [[education]], [[transport]] and [[health]] will be reduced in urban areas.
# Many districts are under-developed. With the expansion of such industries, the regional [[Income gender gap|disparity in income]] can be reduced.
# These industries make effective use of local [[raw material]]s which also promotes primary industries like [[agriculture]] and [[mining]].
# Small-scale industry does not require much capital and [[high tech]]nology. I.T is suited to the traditional economic set-up.
# Cottage and small-scale industries do not use much imported material or equipment.
# The waste of large-scale industries, particularly the cotton, [[sugar]] and [[steel]] industries, can be used to make by-products.
# [[Interior design|Home Decoration]]

== Types of cottage and small-scale industries in Pakistan ==

There is a web of cottage and books industries. In almost every [[village]], there are a number of such industries depending upon the size of the village and the demand for the products. The establishment of such industry is closely related to the availability of raw material traditional skills, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and, in several cases, the local specialization in the organized [[factory]] sector.

There is a large variety of handicrafts available in Pakistan. They are not only aesthetically pleasing items, but they also serve the needs of local people.

Some of these industries produce important export items. Recently exports of non-cotton products have faced increasing [[trade barrier]]s as [[public opinion]] in industrialized countries has expressed growing concern about [[child labour|child labor]], environmental and health standards. These concerns are being addressed now.

=== Carpets ===

In the small scale industries, the most important is the Carpet weaving and its center are located almost all over the Pakistan. It is also significant in economic terms and they make valuable contribution in exports. Cotton is the raw material required for this industry. They also employ women for the production of fine hand woven carpets and for the production of wool silk or a mixture of the two, as the carpets are of great significance which generates equal economic opportunities.It is valuable for gross domestic product of country.

=== Textiles ===

[[Textile]]s are found throughout the country with a variety of design and techniques. The most famous among them are [[Khādī|Khadar]], Susi, Khes, Chunri, Boski, Karandi, Shaal, and [[Ajrak]]. The designs are invariably brightly colored with traditional emphasis on blue and red.

=== Embroidery ===

Embroidery has developed to a fine art with distinctive regional designs and patterns.

=== Jewelry ===

[[Goldsmith|Gold]] and [[silversmith]]s are one of the largest communities of craftsmen. Much of the [[jewellery|jewelry]] made and sold in the cities is intricately fashioned and delicate.

=== Ceramics ===

[[Clay]] and [[terracotta]] pottery and utensils continue to be of great practical importance. Many of the designs of [[urn]]s, [[pitcher]]s, bowls, jugs, plates, and pots seen today are almost identical to those un covered at [[Archaeology|archaeological sites]] around the country. Distinctive glazed blue [[tile]]s are used to decorate many of the great [[mosque]]s in Pakistan.

=== Cutlery ===
[[Wazirabad]] is the city of cutlery industry in Pakistan . This industry is growing day by day and has share of 65 million US dollars in Export for 2010. High Quality Damascus Steel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = 1948 | title = A Sword of the Nydam Type from Ely Fields Farm, near Ely | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society | series = | volume = XLI | issue = | pages = 73–76 | doi = 10.5284/1034398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = February 1960 | title = Pattern-Welding and Damascening of Sword-Blades—Part 1: Pattern-Welding | journal = Studies in Conservation | series = | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–37 | doi = 10.2307/1505063 | jstor = 1505063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = May 1960 | title = Pattern-Welding and Damascening of Sword-Blades—Part 2: The Damascene Process | journal = Studies in Conservation | series = | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 52–60 | doi = 10.2307/1504953 | jstor = 1504953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is manufactured in this city and 95% of world needs are produced here.

=== Woodwork ===

The [[Swat Valley]] is perhaps the most famous for its intricately carved [[Architecture|architectural]] [[woodwork]] and [[furniture]], although [[Woodcarving|wood-carving]] is common throughout the northern mountains.

=== Sports goods ===

[[Sports goods]] earn about 3.7% of our total exports. The main raw material for the sports goods industry are [[leather]] and [[mulberry]] wood that are available in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], but also imported [[PVC]]. [[Football (ball)|Football]], [[hockey]] ball, [[hockey stick]]s, cricket bats and [[Racket (sports equipment)|rackets]] are mostly manufactured by hand. The skilled workers are available in [[Sialkot]] and [[Lahore]]. In the industry large and medium size factories contract work out to small-scale and cottage concerns.The local sports goods manufacturing industry is one of the major source of foreign exchange earnings of Pakistan. It is centralised in and around the city of Sialkot, where it has flourished as a cottage industry with most of its production by generations of skilled craftsmen. At the time of independence, this industry was in an infant stage with a nominal export of Rs. 0.82 million. The Government took immediate steps to develop this industry by providing loans and subsidies to the manufacturers and arrangements were made to market the manufactured goods. Since then, the industry has flourished locally and enjoys good reputation in the international markets as well.mostly these goods are provided to fatima syed productions

Production
At present, there are more than 2000 units, mostly on small scale in operation with an installed capacity of Rs. 20 billion per annum. The units are operating on single-shift basis.

Pakistan produces a wide range of sports goods, accessories, games and athletic equipment generally following the British, American and German specifications.

The Government is also enforcing on a compulsory basis, minimum quality standards for sports goods manufacture. The Pakistan Standards Institute, a government agency, has devised specific standards for different types of sports goods. The important items being produced are tennis rackets, hockey sticks, hokey balls, polo sticks, cricket bats and balls, footballs, (complete) and numerous goods used in both in-door as well out-door games.

At present, Pakistan's sports goods enjoy a world-wide recognition mainly because of the care that goes into their designing, manufacturing and selecting of the finest raw materials. The basic raw materials required for the production of sports goods, are leather, wood, glue, nylon guts, rubber and chemicals. Out of these, leather and various kinds of wood are abundantly available in Pakistan. The industry annually utilises materials worth Rs. 8 billion including imported raw material.

Exports
This industry is one of the major foreign exchange earners for Pakistan and is, therefore, receiving full government backing in its development. It is estimated that more than 75 per cent of the total production is exported every year.

In fact, the export demand has acted as the main stimulus for the rapid growth of this industry because of care that goes into designing, manufacturing and selecting of raw materials. There are two factors which are responsible of this.

(i) Low price as compared to general price level

(ii) Durability plus good workmanship

Export of sports goods increased from $136 million in 1990-91 to $384 million in 1997-98. Showing an average increase of 23 per cent annum as evident from table-1. The export market for sports goods is fairly diversified. More and more countries are being added to the list of their imports. In 1990-91 there were in all 50 countries importing these good from Pakistan. Thereafter, the list has continuously expanded so that during the 1992-98 period, Pakistan exported sports goods to 90 countries. However, the principal importing countries are Germany, USA, UK, France and Italy. Others were Spain, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Denmark, Canada, Belgium, Dubai and Chile. Country-wise export of sports goods is given in table-2.

In the international market, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are the main competitors of Pakistan. They are supplying their products at lower prices. While India has an advantage of cheap labour and raw material Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea have semi-automotive and mechanised units and are always engaged in introducing cheap sports goods such as metal rackets and cricket bats etc.

In order to encourage the export of sports goods, the Government has taken many positive steps and has offered various incentives. Customs duty, sales tax and excise duty rebates on f.o.b. value of exported various types of sports goods are available.

Another incentive is that import of restricted and tanned raw materials are also allowed on cash licenses against export of sports goods.

This industry is facing severe competition from Taiwan, India and South Korea. Although the Government has provided various incentives and facilities to modernise and mechanise the industry, the opportunity has not been availed. The improvement in quality and consequently in exports earnings has been due to the improved availability for leather for manufacture of footballs which constitutes about 75 per cent of the total exports. Keeping in view the trends during 1991-98 about 23 per cent growth rate, improved quality available and competition faced in the international markets the future demand is expected to growth the rate of 15 per cent during 1999-2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jang.com.pk/thenews/investors/aug99/if.htm Chaudhary Arslan Gujar Advocate]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large scale Surgical instruments ===

Sialkot and Lahore are also noted for the manufacture and export of [[surgical instrument]]s. The most important raw material is [[stainless steel]] which has to be imported. In this industry, also, medium scale factories contract work out to small-scale and cottage concerns. Also like the sports goods industry, most of the output is exported.Sialkot is the biggest surgical maker in the world and India, America, Australia and many other countries are importers of surgical instruments from this city. Sialkot has the major role in making surgical instruments

=== Other small-scale industries ===

Other small-scale industries include [[electric fan]]s, [[cutlery]] and general [[engineering]].

″small scale industries are those which generally employed less than workers and they run with or without electric powers, in or outside the home but there assets do not exceed rs.2 million.for example; carpet industry, poultry forming, hand and power loom industry, manufacturing of sports and leather goods, toy industry, agriculture implements etc.″

== Problem of cottage and small-scale industries ==

Cottage and small-scale industries contribution to the [[GDP]] is only 5%. There are certain problems associated with these industries that are mentioned below.

* [[Profit (accounting)|Profits]] are limited and they are mostly spent on the daily expenses of the owners. They do not have extra capital for expansion of these industrial units.
* Economies of scale are not available so [[Production costs|production cost]] is higher. Goods produced in small-scale industries cannot compete in open market if the same goods are manufactured on a large scale.
* The [[wholesaler]], who takes most of the profits, exploits the owners of the small-scale industry. In some cases goods are sold to wholesalers at cost price, which discourages the owners and they reduce the quality and quantity the produced.
* In rural areas, where the [[electricity]] is not provided, small-scale industries are difficult to set up. Even the great fluctuation in voltage and power break-downs cause damage to the [[electric motor]]s. The commercial rates of electricity have also increased significantly which hinders the growth.
* The craftsman and [[artisan]]s learns their skills and production methods from their elders. The provision of technical advice and further training is limited.

== Government policy towards Small-scale and cottage industries ==

The government is fully aware of the potential of cottage and small-scale industries for industrial development. The following organizations have been established to develop this sector of economy.

* Pakistan Small Industries Corporation (PSIC)
* Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC)
* Sindh Small Industries Corporation (SSIC)
* The Small Industries Development Board NWFP (SIDB)
* The Directorate of Small Industries Baluchistan (DSIB)

The above organizations are taking the following measures:

* Establishment of industrial estates.
* Providing [[marketing]] facilities.
* Setting up of technical service centers.
* Establishing handicraft development centers and carpet centers.
* Providing per-investment counseling and guidance to newcomers.
* Providing local and foreign [[loan]]s to small industry owners on easy installments.

According to international organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), '''cultural industries''' (sometimes also known as "[[creative industries]]") combine the creation, production, and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that are [[cultural]] in nature and usually protected by [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;. "Exploring The Cultural and Creative Industries Debate". Culture Action Europe. Retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
The notion of cultural industries generally includes textual, [[music]], [[television]], and [[film]] production and [[publishing]], as well as crafts and design. For some countries, [[architecture]], the visual and [[performing arts]], [[sport]], [[advertising]], and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance.

Cultural industries worldwide have adapted [[To The New]] digital technologies and to the arrival of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global [[oligopoly]].

Within CIM, the product is considered a subset in what meets the customer's need of identification, problem solving, and consumption. The possibility to influence the design and the consumption itself is assumed to be of great importance for the customers buying decision and loyalty.

One example of a company that uses CIM is [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. With the concept [[NikeiD]] they let the customers design their own sport shoes.

More recently companies have started to build Web portals that involve customers in the idea generation, selection, development, and commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrbeck, R., Steinhoff, F. and F.

'''Customer success''' is the function at a company responsible for managing the relationship between a vendor and its customers. The goal of customer success is to make the customer as successful as possible, which in turn, improves [[customer lifetime value]] (CLTV) for the company. 

Customer success is an emerging role in business. It is known as CS. The function is most commonly used in the software world and most prevalent among [[software as a service]] (SaaS) companies. Because customer success is a nascent field of business, its organizational alignment and activities are still evolving.&lt;ref name="Forrester"&gt;Forrester Research, Inc. An Executive Primer to Customer Success Management.  April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}
There is still a large amount of variance with respect to its scope of responsibilities, reporting structure, terminology used for describing its activities, [[performance metric|metrics used for measuring its performance]] and more. While deviations exist in the specifics of the function, it always refers to the [[customer relationship management]] after the initial sale.

== Key sub-functions ==
As customer success is a nascent and fast emerging field, variance is still high with respect to its scope, reporting structure, terminology used for describing its activities, [[performance metrics|metrics used for measuring its performance]] and more.
However, the key functions the CS team is often responsible for include:
# '''Technical Enablement:''' While the scope and [[level of effort]] (LOE) can vary drastically from a few hours to many person-years, almost every software solution, and generally any innovation, requires some level of initial setting and enablement.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M.. Diffusion of Innovations, Fifth Edition. Free Press, 2003 Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;  This activity, which can also be referred to as Initial [[Implementation]] or the Customer On-boarding and Initial Engagement,&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-definition,|title=Customer Success: The Definitive Guide 2018|author=Lincoln Murphy|publisher=sixteenventures.com|date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is normally the first that follows the initial sale of the solution and any add-on component of it and is normally governed by a [[statement of work]] (SOW) that defined the deliverables the software provider commits to provide, the timeframe for it and the commercial structure for the engagement. In many organizations, the team responsible for this function is referred to as [[professional services]].
#'''Knowledge Enablement:''' arming the customer with the knowledge needed to make best use of the solution is a function that can sometimes be independent from the two functions noted above or sometimes provided by one of them. Formal and informal training are part of this function as well as customer-to-customer relations (like community sites) and self-service knowledge systems.
#'''Account Management:''' rounding up the CS function is the team that manages the business relations between the customer and the provider. This function operates in parallel with the technical teams and is working with the customer to ensure they best utilize the provider's capabilities, expand and improve them. They will work to increase adoption of the solution, ensure renewal and expansion of contracts and manage executive relations. This includes being an advocate for the customer to various groups within an organization.

== Customer success managers (CSM) ==
Presently, the customer success function within most organizations is embodied in the customer success manager (CSM) job title.

The CSM acts as the main point of contact and as a trusted advisor for the customer from the vendor side as they are the one ultimately responsible and accountable for that customer's success.&lt;ref name="Nirpaz G. 2016, p. 91"&gt;Nirpaz G., Pizarro F., Farm Don't Hunt: The Definitive Guide to Customer Success, March 2016, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The function may share many of the same functions of traditional account managers, relationship managers, project managers, and technical account managers, but their mode of operations tend to be much more focused on long-term value-generation to the customer. At its heart, it is about maximizing the value the customer generates from utilizing the solutions of the vendor, while enabling the vendor the ability to derive high return from the customer value. To enable that, the CSM must monitor the customer's usage of and satisfaction from the solutions of the vendor, identify opportunities and challenges from the way the customer engages with the solution and take action to help resolve challenges and foster expansion of the usage as well as the value from the solutions (to both sides) over time.

As a consequence, relentlessly monitor and manage the customer health is a key success factor for every CSM&lt;ref&gt;Mehta N., Steinman D. and Murphy L.: Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue. Wiley. February 2016, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the need to deeply understand the drivers of value the customer gains from the solutions provided by the vendor.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta N., Steinman D. and Murphy L.: Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue. Wiley. February 2016, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; Without such deep and timely understanding of these two aspects of the customer, the CSM will not be able to act effectively.

In young organizations, where the total number of employees (and customers) is small, the CSM may be the first employee of the customer success team.&lt;ref name="Nirpaz G. 2016, p. 91"/&gt; As such, they will be responsible for most of the functions described above, which over time may be fulfilled by more specialized team members. Ownership of commercial responsibilities by CSM vary among companies. While some believe a CSM's neutrality from sales or commercial conversations may make a customer more likely to respond to and engage with a CSM, other view the ownership of the commercial relations natural to a long-term relations between a vendor and a customer and more empowering to the CSM.

For CSMs to fulfill the responsibilities of their role, they must be empowered by an organization's executive team to navigate freely among all parts of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta N., Steinman D. and Murphy L.: Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue. Wiley. February 2016, Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; This maintains the CSMs credibility with the customer as an effective resource. In organizations where CSMs are just another level of abstraction or a "screen" between the customer and the resources they need, the credibility of the CSM is compromised and the customer experience eroded which may result in a customer not renewing or expanding their business with the vendor. Furthermore, lacking the top-down support, will deprive the CSM the ability to garner the right resources needed by them to complete their jobs.
== Virtual customer success managers (VCSM) ==
Virtual customer success managers are remote points of contact for customers and monitor the success of customers, providing important feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://esgsuccess.com/|title=CSaaS - Customer Success As A Service - ESG Success|website=CSAAS - ESG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background/history ==

Every company that sells its products and/or services to customers has functions responsible for managing the customer fulfillment and relations. In traditional businesses, those functions are referred to most commonly as "Fulfillment", "Post Sales" or "[[Professional Services]]".{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In the world of technology, companies have been developing, selling and enabling software solutions for many years. At most of those companies the function responsible for managing the relations with customers used to be called "Account Management", "Operations" or "Services".{{cn|date=June 2017}}

As the business world is changing and evolving into new fields, the method by which software is enabled to customers changes. One of the most significant changes in recent years has been the emergence of [[software as a service]] (aka SaaS).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

SaaS is a method of enabling a software solution to customers in a subscription model that departs from the "old" model of granting a perpetual license that enables the customer to own the solution and therefore use it as they see fit (but also be responsible for its operation). Rather, when enabling a solution to customers as a SaaS, companies offer their products as services instead of physical objects, moving the economy to a subscription model.&lt;ref name=Forrester/&gt;{{rp|2}}  The customer "rents" the solution and is able to use it only for the period they have rented it for. The vendor enabling the solution provides not only the solution itself, but also the infrastructure that supports it.

The key implication of this new model is a fundamental shift in the engagement model between the software vendor and its customers. If in the traditional "[[enterprise software]]" model, a customer buys the license to the software and pays the vendor then, regardless of its actual usage, in a SaaS model, the customer pays a (much smaller) rent for the software every month.&lt;ref&gt;Wood J.B., Hewlin, Todd and Lah Thomas, B4B: How Technology and Big Data are Reinventing the Customer-Supplier Relationship, 2013 P 152-3&lt;/ref&gt; The software vendor must therefore ensure the customer is using the solution and seeing value from it if they wanted to ensure the customer continues to pay their rent. This fundamental shift in the software industry's operating model revealed a need for a function at the company to own and ensure that success of its customers.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Jeanne. Chief Customer Officer: Getting Past Lip Service to Passionate Action. Wiley, 2006 P. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prohorchik|first1=Ekaterina|title=The Retail Challenge: Reaching your Connected Customer via the IoT|url=https://www.iflexion.com/blog/the-retail-challenge-reaching-your-connected-customer-via-the-iot|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of this function is what is now being referred to as customer success (CS).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

While the trend towards SaaS has been going on since the beginning of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;Barret, Larry (27 July 2010). "SaaS Market Growing by Leaps and Bounds: Gartner". Datamation. QuinStreet, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; the understanding of the need for much stronger focus on customer success and therefore the creation of the field of customer success only began around 2010–2012.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;Manning, Harley and Bodine, Kerry. Outside In: The Power of Putting Customers at the Center of Your Business. Forrester Research, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183}} On [[LinkedIn]], the world's largest repository of professional bios, only a very small number of people had titles that included "customer success" in 2010 or 2012. By 2015, this number was huge and growing rapidly.

The reason is that the impact of customer success on the performance and value of a SaaS company is huge. The CS function is responsible for retaining and growing the business that the sales team has secured. Case studies show that companies with strong CS teams outperform peers with weak or no CS teams in a multitude of financial criteria including [[customer retention]] (also measured by "[[Churn rate|churn]]", which is the opposite of retention), [[revenue]] growth rates, [[gross margin]], [[customer satisfaction]], and referrals.  In fact, [[customer experience]] is the greatest untapped source of both decreased costs and increased revenue in most industries, but only if companies take the time to understand what underpins it and how they can benefit financially from improving it.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|20}}

''Daigou'' purchases are often from luxury brand boutiques in major fashion cities like [[Paris]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Seoul]].

Asian-American sales associates at   [[Macy's Herald Square]]  sued [[Macy's]] for [[racial discrimination]] in September 2017, alleging that store managers instructed sales associates not to sell more than one unit to any single  Asian customer, and that they were fired when they  spoke up about the alleged discrimination.&lt;ref&gt; Kimberly Yam, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macys-profiling-asian-shoppers-lawsuit_us_59c12e73e4b0186c2205dc2a Former Macy’s Employees Sue Company For Allegedly Racially Profiling Asian Shoppers] [[huffingtonpost.com]] 09/19/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">The '''equity of redemption''' refers to the right of a mortgagor in [[law]] to redeem his or her property once the debt secured by the [[mortgage law|mortgage]] has been discharged.

==Overview==
Historically, a mortgagor (the borrower) and a mortgagee (the lender) executed a conveyance of legal title to the property in favour of the mortgagee as security for the loan.  If the loan was repaid, then the mortgagee would return the property; if the loan was not repaid, then the mortgagee would keep the property in satisfaction of the debt. The equity of redemption was the right to petition the [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] to compel the mortgagee to transfer the property back to the mortgagor once the secured obligation had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Santley v Wilde]]'' [1899] 2 Ch 474&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most mortgages are granted by [[Security interest#Statutory mortgage|statutory charge]] rather than by a formal conveyance, although theoretically there is usually nothing to stop two parties from executing a mortgage in the more traditional manner.&lt;ref&gt;Some countries have limited the grant of traditional mortgages by statute in some circumstances. For example, in [[England and Wales]] a mortgage of land may only be made by way of statutory charge or demise for a term of years absolute (a lease), see sections 85-86 of the Law of Property Act 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the courts have been astute to ensure that the mortgagee did not introduce any artificial stipulations into the contractual arrangements to impede a mortgagor's ability to satisfy obligations and reclaim the property. Such impediments are "clogs" on the equity of redemption, and the courts of equity were particularly astute&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Jones v Morgan]]|year=2001|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=995}} at para 50.&lt;/ref&gt; in striking down any provision which was, or in later cases, which may be, a clog.

Where [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is pledged in [[prime brokerage]] transactions, it is common for the broker to rehypothecate the collateral. Concerns remained, however, that because the rehypothecation might theoretically mean that the lender could lose title to the collateral, and thereby possibly be unable to reconvey it to the primary customer, it was speculated that such rehypothecation is possibly unlawful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The tide has for some years now turned against striking down every clause in a mortgage document that might conceivably impede the right to redeem.&lt;ref&gt;The tide began to turn in ''[[Biggs v Hoddinott]]'' [1898] 2 Ch 307, where it was held that, in a brewery mortgage case, a covenant to take beer from the mortgagee limited to the continuance of the security did not clog the equity of redemption, it being generally realised that an extreme response to perceived clogs undermined the commercial arrangements of the parties.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equity of redemption is itself recognised as a separate species of property, and can be bought, sold or even itself mortgaged by the holder.

Historically the equity of redemption would naturally expire upon the mortgagor breaching the terms of repayment. However, in modern times, extinguishing the equity of redemption (and leaving the mortgagee with absolute title to the property) ordinarily requires a court order in most jurisdictions. For both legal and practical reasons, the use of [[foreclosure]] as a remedy has fallen into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;Foreclosure used to be a mortgagee’s primary remedy, but "it is now rarely sought or granted." see ''[[Palk v Mortgage Services Funding plc]]'' [1993] Ch 330 at 336&lt;/ref&gt;  Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead.

The '''Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank''' (Hungarian: '''Magyar Ipar-és Kereskedelmi Bank''') was an important Hungarian bank in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It was a mediocre bank until the appointment of [[István Tisza]] - a prominent businessman and politician - as its president. Under his direction, it became the largest bank of Hungary within a decade.

The '''LSE SU Alternative Investments Conference''' (also known as the '''LSE AIC''') is an international conference on [[hedge fund]]s, [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]] held annually in London, United Kingdom by the Alternative Investments Society (AIS), a Student’s Union society at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lseaic.com/|title=Home - LSE AIC|website=LSE AIC|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Alternative Investments Society was founded in 2006 by a group of undergraduate students at the LSE, and continues to be run by students from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/about/|title=About - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Alternative Investments Conference was a one-day event hosted on the LSE campus in 2007, and was attended by 200 students who heard from several notable investors. The AIC has evolved considerably over its twelve-year history, having changed venues and ultimately becoming the world’s largest student conference on hedge funds, private equity and venture capital.

==Overview==

=== Format ===
The Conference takes place over two days at the five-star London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, bringing together over 40 senior level industry leaders (see [[LSE Alternative Investment Conference#Notable past speakers|notable past speakers]]) and 320 student delegates from many of the world’s leading educational institutions. Delegates come from a range of backgrounds, including both undergraduates and postgraduates studying finance, law, engineering, history as well as many other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/about/demographics/|title=Demographics - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the Conference is competitive, with only 4.3% of applicants to AIC 2017 being selected to attend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Conference is international in character, with applicants coming from over 200 universities located across more than 120 countries world wide.

The format of the Conference sees delegates attend keynote speeches, panel discussions and workshop sessions designed to allow for them to learn from and interact with experienced professionals from within the investment community. Networking events are also held during the Conference by the AIC’s partner firms, as well as a dinner for all attending delegates hosted during the evening of the first day of the event. Sponsor firms of the AIC include [[Point72 Asset Management]], [http://www.dartmouthpartners.com Dartmouth Partners], [[Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]], [[Terra Firma Capital Partners]], [[GAM (company)|GAM,]] [https://amicusplc.co.uk Amicus], [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Bain Capital]], [[3i]], [[Patron Capital]], [[Lansdowne Partners]], [http://www.stableam.com/disclaimer.asp Stable Asset Management], and [[Dechert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/sponsors/|title=Sponsors - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lex mercatoria''''' (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] for "merchant law"), often referred to as "the Law Merchant" in English, is the body of [[commercial law]] used by merchants throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period. It evolved similar to English [[common law]] as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Sealy and Hooley (2008) 14&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasised contractual freedom and alienability of property, while shunning [[legal technicality|legal technicalities]]{{clarification needed|date=August 2018}} and deciding cases ''[[ex aequo et bono]]''. A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Under ''lex mercatoria'' trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In the last years new theories had changed the understanding of this medieval treatise considering it as proposal for legal reform or a document used for instructional  purposes{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. These theories consider that the treatise cannot be described as a body of laws applicable in its time, but the desire of a legal scholar to improve and facilitate the litigation between merchants. The text is composed by 21 sections and an annex. The sections described procedural matters such as the presence of witnesses and the relation between this body of law and common law. It has been considered as a false statement to define this as a system exclusively based in custom, when there  are structures and elements from the existent legal system, such as Ordinances and even concepts proper of the Romano-canonical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lex Mercatoria and Legal Pluralism: A Late Thirteenth Century Treatise and Its Afterlife|last = Basil, Bestor, Coquillette and Donahue|first = |publisher = Ames Foundation|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was originally a body of rules and principles laid down by merchants to regulate their dealings. It consisted of rules and customs common to merchants and traders in Europe, with some local variation. It originated from the need for quick and effective [[jurisdiction]], administered by specialised [[courts]]. The guiding spirit of the merchant law was that it ought to derive from commercial practice, respond to the needs of the merchants, and be comprehensible and acceptable to the merchants who submitted to it. International commercial law today owes some of its fundamental principles to the ''lex mercatoria''. This includes choice of [[arbitration]] institutions, procedures, applicable law and arbitrators, and the goal to reflect customs, usage and good practice among the parties.

Goods and services flowed freely during the medieval merchant law, thus generating more wealth for all involved. It is debated whether the law was uniform in nature, was spontaneous as a method of dispute resolution, or applied equally to everyone who subordinated to it. The ''lex mercatoria'' was also a means for local communities to [[protectionism|protect]] their own markets. Local kings or lords extracted taxes and set trade restrictions. In 1303 [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] issued the [[Carta Mercatoria]], a charter to foreign merchants in England, which guaranteed them freedom to trade, with certain protections and exemption under the law. Although the charter was revoked by Edward II, due to complaints by English merchants, foreign merchants retained most of their rights in practice, but these would vary widely with the march of time, events and changes to state policy.

==Administration==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was the product of customs and practices among traders, and could be enforced through the local courts. However, the merchants needed to solve their disputes rapidly, sometimes on the hour, with the least costs and by the most efficient means. Public courts did not provide this. A trial before the courts would delay their business, and that meant losing money. The ''lex mercatoria'' provided quick and effective justice. This was possible through informal proceedings, with liberal procedural rules. The ''lex mercatoria'' rendered proportionate judgements over the merchants’ disputes, in light of "fair price", good commerce, and equity.

Judges were chosen according to their commercial background and practical knowledge. Their reputation rested upon their perceived expertise in merchant trade and their fair-mindedness. Gradually, a professional judiciary developed through the merchant judges. Their skills and reputation would however still rely upon practical knowledge of merchant practice. These characteristics serve as important measures in the appointment of international commercial arbitrators today.

The ''lex mercatoria'' owed its origin to the fact that the civil law was not sufficiently responsive to the growing demands of commerce, as well as to the fact that trade in pre-medieval times was practically in the hands of those who might be termed cosmopolitan merchants, who wanted a prompt and effective jurisdiction. It was administered for the most part in special courts, such as those of the guilds in Italy, or the fair courts of Germany and France, or as in England, in courts of the Staple or [[Court of Piepowders|Piepowder]].

==Legal concepts==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was composed of such usages and customs as were common to merchants and traders in all parts of Europe, varied slightly in different localities by special peculiarities. Less procedural formality meant speedier dispensation of justice, particularly when it came to documentation and proof. Out of practical need, the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' originated the “writing obligatory”. By this, creditors could freely transfer the debts owed to them. The “writing obligatory” displaced the need for more complex forms of proof, as it was valid as a proof of debt, without further proof of; transfer of the debt; [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; or a formal bargain for sale. The ''lex mercatoria'' also strengthened the concept of party autonomy: whatever the rules of the ''lex mercatoria'' were, the parties were always free to choose whether to take a case to court, what evidence to submit and which law to apply.

==Reception==
Merchant law declined as a cosmopolitan and international system of merchant justice towards the end of medieval times. This was to a large extent due to the adoption of national commercial law codes. It was also connected with an increasing modification of local customs to protect the interests of local merchants. The result of the replacement of ''lex mercatoria'' codes with national governed codes was the loss of autonomy of merchant tribunals to state courts. The main reason for this development was the protection of state interests.

The nationalisation of the ''lex mercatoria'' did not neglect the practises of merchants or their trans-border trade. Some institutions continued to function, and state judges also were appointed for their merchant expertise, just as modern commercial arbitrators. The laws of the merchants were not eradicated, but simply codified. National codes built on the principles laid down by trade commercial practise and to a large extent they embodied ''lex mercatoria'' substantial rules. This was for example the case in France. The Code Commercial was issued in 1807, where ''lex mercatoria'' rules were preserved to govern formation, performance and termination of contracts. In effect, the nation states reconstituted the ''lex mercatoria'' in their image.

==Common law development==
{{See also|United Kingdom commercial law}}
English courts applied merchant customs only if they were "certain" in nature, "consistent with law" and "in existence since [[time immemorial]]." English judges also required that merchant customs were proven before the court. But even as early as 1608, Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]] described ''lex mercatoria'' as "a part of the common law," and [[William Blackstone]] would later concur.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Brown Scott]], [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA259&amp; ''Law, the State, and the International Community''], p. 259, Columbia University Press, (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continued especially under [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], who is said to be the father of English commercial law. Precepts of the ''lex mercatoria'' were also kept alive through [[Equity (law)|equity]] and the [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] courts in maritime affairs. In the US, traditions of the ''lex mercatoria'' prevailed in the general principles and doctrines of [[Uniform Commercial Code|commercial jurisprudence]].

The history of the ''lex mercatoria'' in England is divided into three stages: the first prior to the time of Coke, when it was a special kind of law – as distinct from the common law – administered in special courts for a special class of the community (i.e. the mercantile); the second stage was one of transition, the ''lex mercatoria'' being administered in the common law courts, but as a body of customs, to be proved as a fact in each individual case of doubt; the third stage, which has continued to the present day, dates from the presidency over the king's bench of [[Lord Mansfield]] (q.v.), under whom it was moulded into the mercantile law of to-day. To the ''lex mercatoria'' modern English law owes the fundamental principles in the law of partnership, negotiable instruments and trade marks.

[[Image:William Murray of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Mansfield was a champion of fusing ''lex mercatoria'' with the [[common law]].]]
[[Sir John Holt]] (Chief Justice 1689 to 1710) and [[Lord Mansfield]] (Chief Justice, 1756 to 1788) were the leading proponents of incorporating the ''lex mercatoria'' into the common law.  Holt did not complete the task, possibly out of his own conservatism (see ''[[Clerke v Martin]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1702) 2 Ld Raym 757&lt;/ref&gt;) and it was Lord Mansfield that became known as the 'founder of the commercial law of this country" (Great Britain).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lickbarrow v Mason]]'' (1787) 2 Term Rep 63, 73, Buller J&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst sitting in [[Guildhall]], Lord Mansfield created,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a body of substantive commercial law, logical, just, modern in character and at the same time in harmony with the principles of the common law. It was due to Lord Mansfield's genius that the harmonisation of commercial custom and the common law was carried out with an almost complete understanding of the requirements of the commercial community, and the fundamental principles of the old law and that that marriage of idea proved acceptable to both merchants and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;CM Schmitthoff, 'International Business Law, A New Law Merchant' in ''Current Law and Social Problems'' (1961) 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Statute of Merchants 1285]] (11 Edw I and 13 Edw I) aka "Statute of Acton Burnell"

==International commercial law and arbitration==
''Lex mercatoria'' precepts have been reaffirmed in new international mercantile law. National trade barriers are torn down in order to induce commerce. The new commercial law is grounded on commercial practice directed at market efficiency and privacy. Dispute resolution has also evolved, and functional methods like international commercial arbitration is now available. These developments have also attracted the interest of empirical sociology of law &lt;ref&gt;cf. Volkmar Gessner/Ali Cem Budak, eds., Emerging Legal Certainty: Empirical Studies on the Globalization of Law. Ashgate: Dartmouth 1998&lt;/ref&gt;The principles of the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' – efficiency, party autonomy, and choice of arbitrator – are applied, and arbitrators often render judgements based on customs. The new merchant law encompasses a huge body of [[international commercial law]].

==Present and future commercial law==
In summary, nation states somewhat fragmented the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' but it is far from destroyed. Local interests triumphed in the medieval ages, just as national interests do today. A modern variant of the ''lex mercatoria'' is the evolving law and dispute resolution in cyberspace. Internet traders are the fastest growing body of merchants in history. Parties can solve domain-name disputes online expeditiously and quickly. In a virtual court documents are filed and examined online, arguments are made online and decisions are published online – seldom challenged before traditional courts of law. ICANN's UDRP (and its proposals for Rapid Suspension) and Nominet's DRS are examples of this. The medieval, the modern and cyberspace merchant laws face comparable issues of enforceability. They solve the problems somewhat differently, but the reaction of the market is the main incentive to comply with a ruling.

Further, ''lex mercatoria'' is sometimes used in international disputes between commercial entities. Most often those disputes are decided by arbitrators which sometimes are allowed (explicitly of implied) to apply ''lex mercatoria'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of such arbitral awards: [http://www.trans-lex.org/000011 Collected by Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, some legal practitioners assume that there is a whole set of legal principles named "''lex mercatoria''" in international or transnational commercial law. The most recent and constantly updated set of rules are the ''[[TransLex Principles]]'' collected and formulated by [[Klaus Peter Berger]] ([[University of Cologne]]) and his [[Center for Transnational Law]].

What remains of ''lex mercatoria'' precepts today is a qualified faith in self-regulation by merchants, and a reluctance to surrender the efficiencies of merchant practice to state confinement.

Many '''advertising characters''' used as [[mascots]] and characters by companies in Australia and New Zealand are similar to those used in the [[List of American advertising characters|United States]] and the [[List of European and British advertising characters|United Kingdom]]. There are, however, quite a number that are unique to these two nations.

Many advertisements shown on New Zealand television are made in Australia, and many Australian and New Zealand companies operate similar businesses on both sides of the [[Tasman Sea]]. As such, there is considerable overlap in advertising characters and mascots found in the two countries.

The following is a list of notable mascots and characters created specifically for [[advertising]] purposes in Australia and New Zealand, listed alphabetically by the [[Product (business)|product]] they represent.

'''Managerial psychology''' is a sub-discipline of industrial and organizational [[psychology]], which focuses on the efficacy of individuals, groups and organizations in the [[workplace]]. Its purpose is to specifically aid [[Management|managers]] in gaining a better understanding of the psychological patterns common among individuals and groups within any given organisation. Managerial psychology can be used to predict and prevent harmful psychological patterns within the workplace and can also be implemented to control psychological patterns among individuals and groups in a way that will benefit the organisation long term. (Robbins, SP et al.2010).

== Managerial psychologists ==
If in the early stages managerial psychologists used to study the problems of fatigue, boredom, and other working conditions that could impede efficient work performance. More recently, their contributions have expanded to include [[learning]], [[perception]], [[personality]], [[emotion]]s, training, leadership, effectiveness, needs and motivational forces, job satisfaction, decision-making processes, performance appraisals, attitude measurement, employee-selection techniques, work design, and job stress(Robbins, SP et al.2010). This means that they apply psychology principles to the workplace and use their skills to study workplace productivity, morale, employee screening or organizational development. Apart from this, they can also train and screen job applicants, assist with organizational development, and consult with corporations on a problem-solving basis.

== Objectives ==
* To understand how to manage stress, change and personal problems
* To understand how to work with a diverse group of people
* To understand how to conduct conflict resolution and the importance of effective confrontation skills
* To understand the importance of ethics in the workplace
* To identify effective leadership styles and the importance of leadership and what makes someone a successful leader
* To learn how to identify skills, motivate, develop and persuade others.

== Personality, motivation and job satisfaction ==
Herzberg et al.’s (1959) seminal [[Two-factor theory|two-factor theory of motivation]] theorized that satisfaction and dissatisfaction were not two opposite extremes of the same sequence, but two separate entities caused by quite different facets of work – these were labelled as “hygiene factors” and “motivators”. Hygiene factors are characterized as extrinsic components of job design that contribute to employee dissatisfaction if they are not met. Examples include: supervision, working conditions, company policies, salary, and relations with co-workers. Motivators, however, are intrinsic to the job itself and include aspects such as achievement, development, responsibility and recognition. On the other hand, intrinsic factors have long been acknowledged as important determinants of motivation. There is a longstanding debate as to whether hygiene factors really contribute to job satisfaction (Furnham et al., 1999; Warr, 1987). Most job satisfaction and motivation research literature is concerned with organisational or situational predictors (such as pay and supervision) (Locke, 1976) while neglecting individual differences (Staw and Ross, 1985). O’Reilly et al. (1980) discovered that individuals’ significantly differ in the way they perceive their jobs, even if the job description and the tasks they had to perform remained constant, thus suggesting that some individual differences must have an effect on work attitudes.

Staw et al. (1986) argued that individual disposition may have a profound influence over how the working world is perceived (i.e. what is important to the individual), and this is likely to affect the type of jobs that are sought.

=== The ten item personality inventory ===
It was first introduced in Gosling et al., (2003) and the ten items of this measure are scored using a seven-point scale, with two statements (one reversed) used to measure each personality variable. The authors report extensive data showing good reliability and validity of this instrument.

=== The work values questionnaire (WVQ) ===
This inventory introduced in Furnham et al., (2005) consists of 37 items and requires individuals to report the extent to which intrinsic (e.g.responsibility and personal growth) and extrinsic (e.g. pay and benefits) components are important to them on a six-point scale. The WVQ is a revised version of Mantech’s(1983) questionnaire. Previous studies have indicated that between two and four factors tend to be extracted, and that these often correspond to Herzberg et al.’s (1959) hygiene and motivator factors .

=== The job satisfaction scale ===
This scale introduced in Warr et al., (1979) consists of 15 items, seven of which measure intrinsic satisfaction, whilst the remaining eight measure extrinsic job satisfaction. Responses are given on a seven-point scale and can be summed to create and overall satisfaction score as well as an intrinsic and extrinsic value.

=== Experiment on personality, motivation and job satisfaction ===
In a recent issue of Journal of Managerial Psychology published in 2009 is presented an experiment with 202 full-time employees (81 males, mean age=38.3 and 121 females, mean age= 28.4) working in very different jobs in the retail, manufacturing and healthcare to investigate the extent to which personality and demographic factors explain variance in motivation and job satisfaction as defined by Herzberg et al.’s (1959) two-factor theory. Every person was given 3 questionnaires ( The ten item personality inventory, The work values questionnaire (WVQ), The job satisfaction scale) and had to complete them via a website.

As predicted, personality and demographic variables were significant correlates of the extracted factors, accounting for between 9 and 15.2 per cent of the variance. Similarly, personality and demographic variables were also significantly related to all three job satisfaction scores and accounted for between 10.5 and 12.7 per cent of the variance. As expected, conscientiousness was a significant correlate of job satisfaction scores in both correlational and regressional analyses. Contrary to expectations, age, job tenure and years working full-time were not significantly related to job satisfaction scores; however, in line with predictions and the two-factor theory, job status was significantly associated with these scores.

Negative relationships were observed between the security and conditions factor and job status, as well as years in full-time employment. These results suggest that individuals with low job status (e.g. graduate positions and non-managerial roles) are more concerned with working conditions and clarity in their work than those of a higher status and individuals who have been working for longer periods.

These results further validate the contention that work attitudes are not the product of situational factors alone, and that both literature and organisations should further investigate the variables that contribute to these values with the intention of increasing job satisfaction and performance, through effective selection methods and pervasive job interventions.

== Tools used by managerial psychologists ==

=== Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs===
[[File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs_Pyramid.png|thumb|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]

[[Abraham Maslow]] developed the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]] model in 1940-50s USA, and the Hierarchy of Needs theory remains valid today for understanding human motivation, management training, and personal development. Maslow's ideas surrounding the Hierarchy of Needs concern the responsibility of employers to provide a workplace environment that encourages and enables employees to fulfill their own unique potential (self-actualization).

While Maslow referred to various additional aspects of motivation, he expressed the Hierarchy of Needs in these five clear stages.

*'''Biological and Physiological needs''' - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, etc.
*'''Safety needs''' - protection from elements, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc.
*'''Belongingness and Love needs''' - work group, family, affection, relationships, etc.
*'''Esteem needs''' - self-esteem, achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, managerial responsibility, etc.
*'''Self-Actualization needs''' - realising personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

=== Douglas McGregor's XY Theory ===

[[Douglas McGregor]], an American social psychologist, proposed his famous X-Y theory in his 1960 book 'The Human Side Of Enterprise'. [[Theory X and Theory Y]] are still referred to commonly in the field of management and motivation. McGregor's ideas suggest that there are two fundamental approaches to managing people. Many managers tend towards theory x, and generally get poor results. Enlightened managers use theory y, which produces better performance and results, and allows people to grow and develop.

==== Theory x ('authoritarian management' style)      ====
* The average person dislikes work and will avoid it he/she can.
* Therefore, most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards organisational objectives.
* The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility; is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

==== Theory y ('participative management' style) ====
* Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
* People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of punishment.
* Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with their achievement.
* People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
* The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.
* In industry the intellectual potential of the average person is only partly utilised.

=== McClelland's Human Motivation Theory      ===
'''''See also''''' [[Need theory]]

[[David McClelland]] in his 1961 book, "The Achieving Society " identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. According to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).

McClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.

==== Achievement ====
People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.

When providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.

==== Affiliation ====
People motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.

When providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.

==== Power ====
Those with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations  or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.

When providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals

An '''operating agreement''' is a key document used by [[limited liability company|LLCs]] because it outlines the business' financial and functional decisions including rules, regulations and provisions. The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant [[statute]] and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to [[by-laws|corporate by-laws]], or analogous to a [[partnership agreement]] in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/basic-information-about-operating-agreements|title=Basic Information About Operating Agreements {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure/limited-liability-company|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:KPI boards Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|KPI information boards.]]
A '''performance indicator''' or '''key performance indicator''' ('''KPI''') is a type of [[performance measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxK0MUHeiI4C |title=Performance indicators |author=Carol Taylor Fitz-Gibbon | year=1990 |issue=2 |isbn=978-1-85359-092-4 |journal= BERA Dialogues}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other initiatives) in which it engages. 

Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer satisfaction, etc.), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making progress toward strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/keyperfindic.htm Key Performance Indicators – What Are Key Performance Indicators or KPI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} What is deemed important often depends on the department measuring the performance – e.g. the KPIs useful to finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales. 

Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with 'performance improvement' initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs is to apply a management framework such as the [[balanced scorecard]].

==Categorization of indicators==
Key performance indicators define a set of values against which to measure. These raw sets of values, which can be fed to systems that aggregate the data, are called ''indicators''. There are two categories of measurements for KPIs. 
* ''[[Level_of_measurement|Quantitative]]'' facts without distortion from personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations presented with a specific value - objective- preferably numeric measured against a standard.
* ''[[Qualitative_property|Qualitative]]'' values based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions and presented as any numeric or textual value that represents an interpretation of these elements. 

An 'indicator' can only measure what 'has' happened, in the past tense, so the only type of measurement is descriptive or lagging.  Any KPI that attempts to measure something in a future state as predictive, diagnostic or prescriptive is no longer an 'indicator' it is a 'prognosticator' - at this point its analytics (possibly based on a KPI).

==Points of measurement==
''Performance'' focuses on measuring a particular ''element'' of an ''activity''. An activity can have four elements: input, output, control, and mechanism. At a minimum, an activity is required to have at least an input and an output. Something goes into the activity as an ''input''; the activity transforms the input by making a change to its ''state''; and the activity produces an ''output''. An activity can also have enabling ''mechanisms'' that are typically separated into ''human'' and ''system'' mechanisms. It can also be constrained in some way by a ''control''. Lastly, its actions can have a temporal construct of ''time''.

* ''Input'' indicates the inputs required of an activity to produce an output.
* ''Output'' captures the outcome or results of an activity or group of activities.
* ''Activity'' indicates the transformation produced by an activity (i.e., some form of work).
* ''Mechanism'' is something that enables an activity to work (a performer), either human or system.
* ''Control'' is an object that controls the activity's production through compliance.
* ''Time'' indicates a temporal element of the activity.

==Identifying indicators of organization==
Performance indicators differ from business drivers and aims (or goals). A school might consider the failure rate of its students as a key performance indicator which might help the school understand its position in the educational community, whereas a business might consider the percentage of income from returning customers as a potential KPI.

The key stages in identifying KPIs are:
* Having a pre-defined business process (BP).
* Having requirements for the BPs.
* Having a quantitative/qualitative measurement of the results and comparison with set goals.
* Investigating variances and tweaking processes or resources to achieve short-term goals.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are ways to periodically assess the performances of organizations, business units, and their division, departments and employees. Accordingly, KPIs are most commonly defined in a way that is understandable, meaningful, and measurable. They are rarely defined in such a way such that their fulfillment would be hampered by factors seen as non-controllable by the organizations or individuals responsible. Such KPIs are usually ignored by organizations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

KPIs should follow the [[SMART criteria]]. This means the measure has a '''S'''pecific purpose for the business, it is '''M'''easurable to really get a value of the KPI, the defined norms have to be '''A'''chievable, the improvement of a KPI has to be '''R'''elevant to the success of the organization, and finally it must be '''T'''ime phased, which means the value or outcomes are shown for a predefined and relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ca.com/content/dam/ca/us/files/white-paper/key-performance-indicators.pdf Key Performance Indicators: Establishing the Metrics that Guide Success], accessed 23 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be evaluated, KPIs are linked to target values, so that the value of the measure can be assessed as meeting expectations or not.

==Examples==

Key performance indicators are the non-financial measures of a company's performance - they do not have a monetary value but they do contribute to the company's profitability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Palffy |first1=Georgina |title=How Business Works |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-46542-979-7 |page=146 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounts===
Some examples are:
# Percentage of overdue invoices
# Percentage of purchase orders raised in advance
# Number of retrospectively raised purchase orders
# Finance report error rate (measures the quality of report)
# Average cycle time of workflow
# Number of duplicate payments

===Marketing and sales===
# New [[customer]] acquisition
# Demographic analysis of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections, and pending numbers
# Status of existing customers
# [[Customer attrition]]
# [[Revenue|Turnover]] (i.e., revenue) generated by segments of the customer population
# Outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment
# Collection of bad debts within customer relationships
# Profitability of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability

Many of these customer KPIs are developed and managed with [[customer relationship management]] software.

Faster availability of data is a competitive issue for most organizations. For example, businesses which have higher operational/credit risk (involving for example credit cards or wealth management) may want weekly or even daily availability of KPI analysis, facilitated by appropriate IT systems and tools.

===Manufacturing===
[[Overall equipment effectiveness]] is a set of broadly accepted non-financial metrics which reflect manufacturing success.
* '''OEE''' = availability x performance x quality
* '''Availability''' = run time / total time, by definition this is the percentage of the actual amount of production time the machine is running to the production time the machine is available.
* '''Performance''' = total count / target counter, by definition this is the percentage of total parts produced on the machine to the production rate of machine.
* '''Quality''' = good count / total count, by definition, this is the percentage of good parts out of the total parts produced on the machine. 
* '''Cycle time ratio''' (CTR) = standard cycle time / real cycle time
* [[Utilization]]
* [[Rejection rate]]

===Professional Services===
Most [[professional services]] firms (for example: management consultancies, systems integration firms, or digital marketing agencies) use three key performance indicators to track the health of their businesses. They typically use [[professional services automation]] (PSA) software to keep track of and manage these metrics.
* '''[[Utilization rate]]''' = the percentage of time employees spend generating revenue 
* '''Project profitability''' = the difference between revenue generated by a project and the cost of delivering the work 
* '''Project success rate''' = the percentage of projects delivered on time and under budget

===System operations===
* [[Availability]] / [[uptime]]
* [[Mean time between failure]]
* [[Mean time to repair]]
* Unplanned availability
* Average time to repair

===Project execution===
* [[Earned value management|Earned value]]
* Estimate to complete
* Manpower spent / month
* Money spent / month
* Planned spend / month
* Planned manpower / month
* Average time to delivery
* Tasks / staff
* Project overhead / ROI
* Planned delivery date vs actual delivery date

===Supply chain management===
Businesses can utilize KPIs to establish and monitor progress toward a variety of goals, including lean manufacturing objectives, [[minority business enterprise]] and diversity spending, environmental "green" initiatives, cost avoidance programs and [[low-cost country sourcing]] targets.

Any business, regardless of size, can better manage supplier performance with the help of KPIs robust capabilities, which include:
* Automated entry and approval functions
* On-demand, real-time scorecard measures
* Rework on procured inventory
* Single data repository to eliminate inefficiencies and maintain consistency
* Advanced workflow approval process to ensure consistent procedures
* Flexible data-input modes and real-time graphical performance displays
* Customized cost savings documentation
* Simplified setup procedures to eliminate dependence upon IT resources

Main SCM KPIs will detail the following processes:
* Sales forecasts
* Inventory
* Procurement and suppliers
* Warehousing
* Transportation
* [[Reverse logistics]]

Suppliers can implement KPIs to gain an advantage over the competition. Suppliers have instant access to a user-friendly portal for submitting standardized cost savings templates. Suppliers and their customers exchange vital supply chain performance data while gaining visibility to the exact status of cost improvement projects and cost savings documentation.

===Government===
The provincial government of [[Ontario, Canada]] has been using KPIs since 1998 to measure the performance of higher education institutions in the province. All post secondary schools collect and report performance data in five areas – graduate satisfaction, student satisfaction, employer satisfaction, employment rate, and graduation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegesontario.org/outcomes/key-performance-indicators/2011_kpi_results.pdf |title=Key Performance Indicators |publisher=Colleges Ontario |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further performance indicators===
* Duration of a [[stockout]] situation

: &lt;math&gt;\text{ROC} = \frac{\text{Close}-\text{Close (Past)}}{\text{Close (Past)}}\times100&lt;/math&gt;

* Customer order waiting time

'''Human Resource Management'''

* Employee turnover
* Employee performance indicators
* Cross functional team analysis

==Problems ==
In practice, overseeing key performance indicators can prove expensive or difficult for organizations. Some indicators such as staff morale may be impossible to quantify. As such, dubious KPIs can be adopted that can be used as a rough guide rather than a precise benchmark.&lt;ref name=Daddis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daddis|first1=Gregory|title=No Sure Victory: Measuring U.S. Army Effectiveness and Progress in the Vietnam War|date=June 1, 2011|isbn=978-0-19974-687-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key performance indicators can also lead to [[perverse incentive]]s and [[unintended consequences]] as a result of employees working to the specific measurements at the expense of the actual quality or value of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Measuring-Managing-Performance-Organizations-Robert/dp/0932633366 Robert D Austin, "Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Fowler |url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html |title=CannotMeasureProductivity |publisher=Martinfowler.com |date=2003-08-29 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes the collecting of statistics can become a substitute for a better understanding of the problems so the use of dubious KPIs can result in progress in aims and measured effectiveness becoming different. For example, US soldiers during the Vietnam War were shown to be effective in kill ratios and high body counts, but this was misleading when used to measure aims as it did not show the lack of progress towards the US goal of increasing South Vietnamese government control of its territory.&lt;ref name=Daddis/&gt; Another example would be to measure the productivity of a software development team in terms of lines of source code written.  This approach can easily result in large amounts of dubious code being added, thereby inflating the line count but adding little of value in terms of systemic improvement.  A similar problem arises when a footballer kicks a ball uselessly in a match in order to build up his statistics.

[[File:Stakeholder (en).svg|thumb|Internal and external stakeholders]]
In management, a '''stakeholder approach''' suggests that managers should formulate and implement processes which satisfy [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' needs in order to ensure the long-term success of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=James E.|last2=Preston|first2=Lee E.|last3=Sachs|first3=Sybille|date=2002-10-01|title=Managing the Extended Enterprise: The New Stakeholder View|url=http://cmr.ucpress.edu/content/45/1/6|journal=California Management Review|volume=45|issue=1|pages=6–28|doi=10.2307/41166151|issn=0008-1256}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the degree of participation of the different groups, the company can take advantage of market imperfections in order to create valuable opportunities. It emphasizes active management of the business environment, relationships and the promotion of shared interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|last2=McVea|first2=John|date=2001-01-01|title=A Stakeholder Approach to Strategic Management|ssrn=263511}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is based on the [[stakeholder theory]] which arises as a counterpart to the dominant way of understanding business and management that is focused on shareholders satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=xF8-WN1QlIMC|title=Stakeholder Theory: The State of the Art|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|last2=Harrison|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Wicks|first3=Andrew C.|last4=Parmar|first4=Bidhan L.|last5=Colle|first5=Simone de|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139484114|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this approach can reinforce the firm values and create competitive advantage. However, it has been criticized for overvaluing stakeholders and its difficulty to reach consensus. [[File:Stakeholder management process.png|thumb|Stakeholder management process]]

== Utility ==
=== Competitive advantage ===
This approach is more able to create competitive advantage because it creates a link between the firm and stakeholders. The latter will perceive the coherent application of the organizational values and will relate those values with his own. In that way, the company will have the needed information about stakeholders in order to treat them well and develop important initiatives. By doing that, the firm’s reputation and loyalty will be reinforced among customers and other stakeholders alike, it will create stronger [[brand recognition]] and will increase trust in the firm.  Even if there are limits in loyalty and reputation can be damaged, those two key elements can make a big difference creating barriers to other companies that may want to have information about stakeholder utility functions. A firm that follows the stakeholder approach will get the information needed to work for satisfying the stakeholders’ needs, making it easier to develop expertise. Those acquired skills can be transmitted, promoted and reinforced across the [[Business operations|business operation]] of the firm creating [[Core competency|core competencies]]. Over time, this approach can become an indispensable issue in the organizational culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maignan|first=Isabelle|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Tracy|last3=Hult|first3=Tomas|last4=Ferrell|first4=O.C.|date=25 July 2011|title=Stakeholder orientation: development and testing of a framework for socially responsible marketing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232971635_Stakeholder_orientation_Development_and_testing_of_a_framework_for_socially_responsible_marketing|journal=Journal of Strategic Marketing|volume=19|pages=313–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Value creating through innovation ===
Firms that manage for stakeholders are more able to attract a higher-quality workforce. Employees’ job satisfaction has an impact on the firm’s ability to foster innovation. Workers who are satisfied with their jobs are more likely to engage in long-term thinking and generate potentially valuable ideas. Those firms can use information about stakeholder to devise new ways of satisfying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flammer|first=Caroline|last2=Kacperczyk|first2=Aleksandra|date=2014-08-19|title=The Impact of Stakeholder Orientation on Innovation: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|ssrn=2353076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity is a key aspect in this approach: when stakeholders stand to benefit, they are more likely to reveal information about their utility function. That is why firms and firm managers can better meet consumers' needs by understanding their own customers and suppliers and using this information strategically and flexibly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Bosse|first2=Douglas A.|last3=Phillips|first3=Robert A.|date=2010-01-01|title=Managing for Stakeholders, Stakeholder Utility Functions, and Competitive Advantage|jstor=27735509|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=31|issue=1|pages=58–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limits ==

=== Divergent interests ===
The implication of all the stakeholders may produce divergent views making it difficult to reach consensus.&lt;ref name="O’Haire"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62575/|title=Strengths and Limitations of Stakeholder Engagement Methods|last=O’Haire|first=Christen|last2=McPheeters|first2=Melissa|last3=Nakamoto|first3=Erika|last4=LaBrant|first4=Lia|last5=Most|first5=Carole|last6=Lee|first6=Kathy|last7=Graham|first7=Elaine|last8=Cottrell|first8=Erika|last9=Guise|first9=Jeanne-Marie|date=2011-06-01|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each stakeholder may care mostly about its own benefits or self-interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265225773_The_Risks_of_Relying_on_Stakeholder_Engagement_for_the_Achievement_of_Sustainability|title=The Risks of Relying on Stakeholder Engagement for the Achievement of Sustainability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to satisfy a large number of players will complicate governance.{{cn|date=August 2017}} It can result in time consuming in engaging all the parties. Moreover, in this approach, an equality of stakeholders and business is implied in negotiating issues of mutual interest. That assumption has been critiqued in terms of an inequality of resources, negotiating power and time required. The identification of prices and opportunity costs for the different stakeholders difficult and reduce the operability of this approach.&lt;ref name="O’Haire"/&gt;

=== Overvaluing stakeholders ===
It has been suggested that obtaining information about stakeholders' utility functions may produce costs that can exceed the benefits. Therefore, in its intention to create value, managing for stakeholders can end up allocating too many resources to stakeholders. Also, having into account that the power among stakeholders is not equal, some powerful actors can get much of the firm’s profitability. And with that distribution of value, shareholders cannot expect a maximization of returns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stakeholder management''' is a critical component to the successful delivery of any project, programme or activity. A [[Project stakeholders|stakeholder]] is any individual, group or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a programme.&lt;ref name="Stakeholder Identification"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=59| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder management creates positive relationships with stakeholders through the appropriate management of their expectations and agreed objectives. Stakeholder management is a process and control that must be planned and guided by underlying principles. Stakeholder management within businesses, organizations, or projects prepares a [[strategy]] using information (or intelligence) gathered during the following common processes.

==Stakeholder identification==
{{main|Stakeholder analysis}}
The first step in your stakeholder analysis is to brainstorm who your stakeholders are. As part of this, think of all the people who are affected by your work, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion. Remember that although stakeholders may be both [[organization]]s and [[people]], ultimately you must communicate with people. Make sure that you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder organization.&lt;ref name="Prioritize Your Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=64| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So in a nutshell, the stakeholder management comprises four steps:&lt;ref name="Stakeholder management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.apm.org.uk/bok/stakeholder-management |title=APM Knowledge Stakeholder management |author=Association for Project Management (APM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify, recognize and acknowledge stakeholder;
* Determine their influence and interest;
* Establish [[communication management]] plan
* Influencing and engaging stakeholder

==Stakeholder prioritization ==
You may now have a long list of people and organizations that are affected by your work. Some of these may have the power either to block or advance. Some may be interested in what you are doing, others may not care. Map out your stakeholders on a Power/Interest Grid, and classify them by their power over your work and by their interest in your work. There are other tools available to map out your stakeholders and how best to influence them.

For example, your boss is likely to have high power and influence over your projects and high interest. Your family may have high interest, but are unlikely to have power over it. Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:
*'''High power, interested people:''' these are the people you must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
*'''High power, less interested people:''' put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message.
*'''Low power, interested people:''' keep these people adequately informed, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. These people can often be very helpful with the detail of your project.
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' again, monitor these people, but do not bore them with excessive communication.

==Understanding your key stakeholders==
You now need to know more about your key stakeholders. You need to know how they are likely to feel about and react to your project. You also need to know how best to engage them in your project and how best to communicate with them.  Key questions that can help you understand your stakeholders are:
*What financial or emotional interest do they have in the outcome of your work? Is it positive or negative?
*What motivates them most of all?
*What information do they want from you?
*How do they want to receive information from you? What is the best way of communicating your message to them?
*What is their current opinion of your work? Is it based on good information?
*Who influences their opinions generally, and who influences their opinion of you? Do some of these influencers therefore become important stakeholders in their own right?
*If they are not likely to be positive, what will win them around to support your project?
*If you don't think you will be able to win them around, how will you manage their opposition?
*Who else might be influenced by their opinions? Do these people become stakeholders in their own right?

==Key principles of stakeholder engagement==
* Communicate: To ensure intended message is understood and the desired response achieved.
* Consult, early and often: To get the useful information and ideas, ask questions.
* Remember, they are human: Operate with an awareness of human feelings.
* Plan it: Time investment and careful planning against it, has a significant payoff.
* Relationship: Try to engender trust with the stakeholders. 
* Simple but not easy: Show your care. Be empathetic.Listen to the stakeholders.
* [[Risk management|Managing risk]]: Stakeholders can be treated as risk and opportunities that have probabilities and impact.
* Compromise: Compromise across a set of stakeholders' diverging priorities.
* Understand what is success: Explore the value of the project to the stakeholder.
* Take responsibility: Project governance is the key of project success

==Organizational stakeholders==
It is well acknowledged that any given organization will have multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and so forth. Within the field of marketing, it is believed that customers are one of the most important stakeholders for managing its long-term value, with a firm's major objective being the management of customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. Greenley and Gordon R. Foxall. (2003). Multiple Stakeholder Orientation in UK Companies and the Implications for Company Performance. ''Journal of Management Studies, 34'', 259–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engaging and communicating with stakeholders==

With a clear understanding of your Stakeholders, engaging and communicating can be achieved through a variety of channels based upon who the stakeholder is.&lt;ref name="Managing Stakeholder Expectations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmiglc.org/PD/Uploads/PMIGreatLakesChapter_Dec2011Forum_GMoore.pdf |last=Moore |first=Gwendolyn |date=December 12, 2011 |title=PMI Great Lakes Chapter Forum, Tools and Techniques for Managing Stakeholder Expectations |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''High power, interested people:''' Manage closely. Best channels: [[Issue Log|Issue]], Change Logs, Status Meetings
*'''High power, less interested people:''' Keep satisfied. Best channels: Steering Committee, Board Meeting Updates
*'''Low power, interested people:''' Keep informed. Best channels: In-Person, Video, Email Updates
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' Monitor. Best channels: Send Email, Status Reports

A '''teal organisation''' is an emerging organisational [[paradigm]] that advocates a level of [[consciousness]] including all previous [[world view]]s within the operations of an [[organization|organisation]]. The concept of teal organisation refers to the next stage in the evolution of [[consciousness]] and was introduced in 2014 by [[Frederic Laloux]] in his book on [[Reinventing Organizations]].&lt;ref name="lalouxfred-book"&gt;{{cite book  | title= Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness |url= http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/ | location = |last= Laloux   |first =  Frederic |date = 2014 | publisher = Nelson Parker |page= 381 |isbn= 978-2960133509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stratbusy&gt;{{cite web|title= The Future of Management Is Teal |url= https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921 |website= Strategy + Business  |date= July 6, 2015  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also rests on previous studies done by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] and [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] including [[Jean Gebser]], [[Clare W. Graves]], [[Don Edward Beck]], Chris Cowan and [[Ken Wilbur|Ken Wilber]] who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html "Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap"], by Clare W.

== Overview ==
A teal organisation transcends and integrates the existing limitations of current static organisational paradigms including Amber, Orange and Green organisations.&lt;ref name=huffpost1&gt;{{cite news  |title= Reinventing Management, Part 1: What Color Is Your Organization?  |url=  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/great-work-cultures/reinventing-management-pa_b_9387286.html  |newspaper= [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] |last=  Collins  |first= Rod   |date= March 4, 2016 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by three [[Epiphany (feeling)|breakthroughs]] in human [[collaboration]], specific to this evolutionary level: ''self-management'' suggests a system based on peer relationships with no need for hierarchy, consensus, nor central command and control; ''wholeness'' is about a consistent set of practices that invite members to reclaim their inner wholeness and bring on the workplace “all of who they are”;&lt;ref name=futureconsid1&gt;{{cite web |title= What does Wholeness mean in the context of Teal Organising? |url= https://futureconsiderations.com/wholeness-in-the-context-of-teal/  |website=  Future Considerations |date= July 7, 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''evolutionary purpose'' introduces a teal organisation as a living [[organism]] with a direction of its own where its members are invited to listen and take note of the purpose it wants to serve. These breakthroughs overcome the limitations of  previous organisational models in that they welcome the emotional, intuitive, and spiritual elements in lieu of the usual display of rationality, determination and strength; and concealment of doubts or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Most Dangerous Notion in "Reinventing Organizations"  |url=  https://medium.com/@jessicajprentice/the-most-dangerous-notion-in-reinventing-organizations-9032930295e2  |date= July 6, 2015 |publisher= [[Medium (website)|Medium Corporation]] |author= Jessica Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its evolution, a teal organisation exhibits properties similar to [[complex adaptive system]]s because the interactions and relationships between its elements are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] and based on few simple rules or guiding principles. These elements learn from the past and their immediate environment and then adapt accordingly for the survival of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Andersson |first= Malin|date= 2015 |title=Exploring the latest paradigm shift in organizational consciousness development, by using the framework from Reinventing Organizations |type= Master thesis|chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.835.4680&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of notable organisations around the world has adopted and operates on the teal organisation model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  The Design Principles evolve "naturally" in the workplace and the need for a scientific foundation |url= https://www.prosocial.world/post/the-design-principles-evolve-naturally-in-the-workplace-and-the-need-for-a-scientific-foundation  |publisher= Prosocial World |date= June 2, 2017 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[The Morning Star Company]] (food processing, United States),&lt;ref name=morningself&gt;{{cite web|title= The Morning Star Company - Self-Management |url= http://morningstarco.com/index.cgi?Page=Self-Management  |website=  morningstarco.com |date=  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]]  (apparel, United States), [[Sounds True]] (media, United States), AES  (energy sector, international), [[Buurtzorg Nederland]] (health care, Netherlands), ESBZ ([[K–12]] school, Germany), Heiligenfelde  (mental health hospitals, Germany), [[Nucor]] (steel manufacturing, international).

'''Telligent, A Verint Company''' is an enterprise collaboration and community software business founded in 2004 by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]]. The company changed its name to Zimbra, Inc in September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2013/09/25/zimbra-unveils-integrated-team-culture-and-vision-for-people-centered-collaboration-at-user-group-conference.aspx |last=Henry |first=Tiffany |title=Zimbra Unveils Integrated Team, Culture and Vision for People-Centered Collaboration at User Group Conference |publisher=Telligent |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; after completing the acquisition of [[Zimbra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2577-Telligent-acquires-Zimbra-Does-social-software-want-to-be-email-when-it-grows-up |last=Kompella |first=Kashyap |title=Telligent acquires Zimbra - Does social software want to be email when it grows up? |publisher=Real Story Group |date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[VMWare]]. In August 2015 Zimbra's Telligent business was acquired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.verint.com/customer-engagement/verint-acquires-telligent-and-extends-portfolio-into-communities |last=Stockford |first=Paul |title=Verint Acquires Telligent and Extends Portfolio into Communities |publisher=Saddletree Research |date=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Verint Systems]], Inc. Verint continues to operate Telligent as an independent business unit. Also in August 2015 the remaining assets of Zimbra, Inc were acquired by Synacor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/social-business/zimbra-acquired-again-this-time-by-synacor/ |publisher=CMS Wire |last=Nicastro |first=Dom |title=Zimbra Acquired Again, This Time by Synacor |date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Company history==
Telligent was founded by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]] in 2004. Howard was previously a founding member of Microsoft's [[ASP.NET]] team and helped build and run the Microsoft ASP.NET community. 

Telligent introduced its first product, [[Telligent Community|Community Server]], in the fall of 2004. Community Server was an integrated community platform that brought together blogs, wikis, forums, user profiles, etc. Community Server was based on the work done by Rob Howard on the ASP.NET Forums, Jason Alexander on nGallery, and Scott Watermasysk on .Text.

Dell and MySpace both became Telligent customers in 2006. Dell started a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/Direct2Dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2006/07/11/real-people-are-here-and-we-re-listening.aspx|title=Real People are Here and We're Listening|publisher=Lionel Menchaca|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Telligent's platform in response to [[Jeff Jarvis]]' post about his dissatisfaction with a Dell laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/10/18/dell-hell-the-end/|title=Dell Hell:The end?|publisher=BuzzMachine|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007 Telligent introduced a [[social analytics]] tool called [[Telligent Analytics|Harvest Reporting Server]].

In 2008, [[Intel Capital]] became Telligent's first capital partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/capital/news/releases/080922.htm|title=Intel Capital to Acquire $20 Million Stake in Telligent |publisher=Intel|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Patrick Brandt took over as CEO and Rob Howard became CTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2009/05/19/patrick-brandt-joins-telligent-as-chief-executive-officer.aspx|title=Patrick Brandt Joins Telligent as Chief Executive Officer|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Brandt was previously CEO of Skywire Software, which was acquired by Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2008_jun/skywire.html|title=Oracle Buys Skywire Software |publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an undisclosed amount. Telligent also re-branded its product offering as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-20/telligent-updates-and-rebrands-community-solutions-new-analytics-solution-004889.php|title=Telligent Updates and ReBrands Community Solutions, New Analytics Solution|publisher=CMS Wire|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Server became [[Telligent Community]], Harvest Reporting Server became [[Telligent Analytics]], and Community Server Evolution became Telligent Enterprise. Telligent also formally introduced the Telligent Evolution platform upon which Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise were based.

As part of the company re-positioning, Telligent discontinued development and support for Graffiti CMS and made it available as an open source project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2009/12/11/graffiti-cms-is-now-open-source.aspx|title=Graffiti CMS is now open source|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent also discontinued BlogMailr, a free email-to-blog service.

In 2010 David Mitchell joined Telligent's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/07/07/telligent-welcomes-new-board-member.aspx|title=Telligent Welcomes New Board Member|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is currently CEO of [http://www.global360.com/ Global 360] and was previously CEO of WebMethods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/WebMethods-names-new-CEO,-chairman/2100-1012_3-5395279.html|title=WebMethods names new CEO, chairman|publisher=CNet News|accessdate=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent additionally added Wendy Gibson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/10/07/announcing-chief-marketing-officer-wendy-gibson.aspx|title=Welcome Wendy Gibson as Telligent's CMO|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Chief Marketing Officer.

On December 19, 2011, Telligent acquired Leverage Software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastechpulse.com/telligent_buys_enterprise_social_networking_firm/s-0040067.html Telligent Buys Enterprise Social Networking Firm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2013, Telligent acquired [[Zimbra]] from [[Vmware]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/vmware-divests-zimbra-nyse-vmw-1810955.htm Vmware Divests Zimbra]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2015, Telligent was acquired by [[Verint Systems]], Inc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.verint.com/news-events/press-releases-2015/verint-extends-customer-engagement-optimization-vision-adding-innovative-community-software |title=Verint Extends Customer Engagement Optimization Vision, Adding Innovative Community Software |publisher=Verint |date=2015-08-17}}{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/CRM-Across-the-Wire/Verint-Acquires-Telligent-105795.aspx |title=Verint Acquires Telligent |publisher=DestinationCRM.com |date=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Products==
Telligent's products are built on the [[Microsoft .NET]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. They are primarily used as on-premises, white label software solutions.

===Telligent Community ===
[[Telligent Community]] (formerly Community Server), built on the Telligent Evolution platform, is Telligent's flagship product. It was first introduced in 2004 and the most recent version is 5.6 as of October 2010.

Telligent Community is designed to support external facing communities and the primary use cases are: digital marketing, support communities, and networking.

===Telligent Enterprise ===
Telligent Enterprise, built on the Telligent Evolution platform, was first introduced in 2008 in response to users of Telligent Community asking Telligent to provide an employee-focused solution. Telligent Enterprise version 2.6 was released October 2010.

Telligent Enterprise is designed to support enterprise 2.0 / internal communities, private business-to-business communities, and private networking communities. An emphasis on integration with enterprise email systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, and enterprise identity management systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory, are examples of how Telligent Enterprise differs from Telligent Community.

=== Telligent Analytics ===
Telligent introduced Telligent Analytics in 2007 as Harvest Reporting Server. Telligent Analytics is designed to analyze people and information created within the Telligent Evolution platform. This includes both Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise. It additionally includes any data created on applications that run on the Telligent Evolution platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3695">{{Insolvency}}
'''Trading while insolvent''' is unlawful in a number of legal systems, and may result in the directors becoming personally liable for a company's debts.

Under [[UK insolvency law]] trading once a company is legally insolvent can trigger several provisions of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Act 1986|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110709051253/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 July 2011|website=Insolvency.gov.uk|publisher=UK Statutes Crown|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Wrongful trading]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 214
*[[Undervalue transaction|Transaction at an undervalue]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 238
*[[Unfair preference|Preferences]]&amp;nbsp;– Section 239
*Extortionate credit transactions&amp;nbsp;– Section 244

A limited company becomes [[insolvent]] when it can no longer pay its bills when due, or its liabilities—including [[contingent liabilities]] such as [[redundancy payments]]—outweigh the company’s assets. This is a critical point in the lifespan of a company as it denotes when the [[Director (business)|directors]]' responsibilities change from the [[shareholders]] to the [[creditors]]. It also means that the directors need to be extremely careful when considering whether to continue to trade, or not. Any director who knows that the company is insolvent and makes the decision to continue to [[Trade (financial instrument)|trade]], and in doing so increases the debts of the company can be made liable for the company debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading whilst insolvent|url=https://www.companyliquidation.solutions/trading-whilst-insolvent-wrongful-trading/|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In most legal systems, the liability in respect of other transactions only extends for a certain period of time prior to the company going into liquidation. In the UK, directors are exposed in respect of transaction at an undervalue, preferences, and extortionate credit transactions if the transaction occurred: a) while the company was insolvent; and b) within 2 years before the onset of liquidation if the transaction was with a connected person, and 6 months if the transaction was with an unconnected person.

Directors who continue to trade while insolvent may face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provision of this act, when a company goes into [[liquidation]], the liquidator must make a report to the Disqualification Unit of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] on the conduct of all directors. If the liquidator has come across any conduct which makes the director unfit to be involved in the management of a company in the future (which things would include trading while insolvent) the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will apply to the Court for an order disqualifying the director or directors from acting as a [[Board of directors|company director]] for a certain period of time.

Many other countries have similar laws, often referred to as 'insolvent trading' or [[wrongful trading]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">'''Travel Management Companies''' ('''TMC'''s) are organizations that manage organizations' [[Corporate travel management|corporate or business travel program]]. They will often provide an end-user online booking tool, mobile application, program management, and consulting teams, executive travel services, meetings and events support, reporting functionality, and more. These companies use [[Global Distribution System]]s (GDS) to book flights for their clients. This allows the travel consultant to compare different itineraries and costs by displaying availability in real-time, allowing users to access fares for air tickets, [[hotel rooms]] and [[rental cars]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK0Fimlcz5E What is a TMC?].

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 is Obsolete, But it Doesn't Matter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/08/e3-is-obsolete-but-it-doesnt-matter/|publisher=Forbes|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Penny Arcade Expo]], and [[:Category:Video game conventions|others]].

[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. [[Sony]] established [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] in [[Silicon Valley]] to run [[PlayStation]], the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.&lt;ref name=wired-sie&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Interactive Entertainment Merges PlayStation Biz Units|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/sony-interactive-entertainment/|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced,&lt;ref name=e12a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/amd-vp-saeid-moshkelani-interview/|work=[[Engadget]]|title=AMD's Saeid Moshkelani on building custom silicon for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U |date=June 12, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H. Baer]] ([[Magnavox Odyssey]], the "Father of Video Games"), [[Jonathan Blow]] (''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''), [[John D. Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
The United States recognizes [[eSports]] players as professional athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/14/the-u-s-now-recognizes-esports-players-as-professional-athletes/|title=The U.S. Now Recognizes eSports Players As Professional Athletes|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Gaming]] has eSports arenas and studios across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/major-league-gaming-announces-its-own-arena-in-columbus-ohio/|title=Major League Gaming announces its own arena in Columbus, Ohio|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morris University]] has a [[League of Legends]] [[varsity team]], whose members are eligible for [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/219522/Illinois_university_makes_League_of_Legends_a_varsity_sport.php |title=Illinois university makes League of Legends a varsity sport|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''voting trust''' is an arrangement whereby the [[stock|shares]] in a [[company (law)|company]] of one or more [[stockholder|shareholders]] and the voting rights attached thereto are legally transferred to a [[trustee]], usually for a specified period of time (the "trust period").  In some voting trusts, the trustee may also be granted additional powers (such as to sell or redeem the shares).  At the end of the trust period, the shares would ordinarily be re-transferred to the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary(ies)]], although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to re-vested on the voting trusts with identical terms.

Voting trusts were made popular in [[Delaware]] [[corporate law]], but they have since been adopted widely by other states in the United States. They have also been extensively adopted in [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]].

== Purposes ==

There are several reasons why shareholders may wish to put a voting trust arrangement in place.
* Several shareholders may wish to create a unified block of votes, which together gives them more power than the collective sum of their fragmented interests.
* In many countries, in order to call [[general meeting]]s, shareholders need to hold a certain percentage of the issued shares of the company.  By aggregating their shares, the shareholders can confer this power on themselves collectively where they might not have it individually.
* Locking shares up in voting trusts can in some countries help deter a [[hostile takeover]].
* Voting trusts are also sometimes used to resolve [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].  By putting the shares in a trustee who can vote them at arm's-length from the beneficiary(ies) of the trust, this can in some circumstances mitigate or absolve the original shareholder from what might otherwise constitute a conflict of interest (although in practice, to resolve conflicts of interest the trust will ordinarily be "[[blind trust]]"; while all blind trusts are necessarily voting trusts, not all voting trusts are blind trusts).
* Shares are sometimes aggregated into a voting trust to facilitate a corporate reorganisation.
* Promoters of companies sometimes aggregate their shares in a voting trust to safeguard control of the company.

A '''workflow''' consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the [[System|systematic]] organization of [[resource]]s into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information.&lt;ref name="ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutFTB/Projects/ITSP/BPM_Glossary.pdf|date=27 October 2009|title=Business Process Management Center of Excellence Glossary|author=webmaster@ftb.ca.gov|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ISO 12052:2006, [http://www.iso.org ISO.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ISO/TR 16044:2004, [http://www.iso.org ISO.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The flow being described may refer to a [[document]], service, or [[product (business)|product]] that is being transferred from one step to another.

Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as information technology, [[team]]s, [[project]]s and [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="nocsmart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nocsmart.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=135 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907014418/http://nocsmart.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=135 |archivedate=2013-09-07 |dead-url=yes |title=Work Flow Automation |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=31 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The development of the concept of workflow occurred above a series of loosely defined, overlapping eras.

=== Beginnings in manufacturing ===
The modern history of workflows can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Gantt]], although the term "workflow" was not in usage as such during their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workflow%2Cwork+flow%2C+work-flow&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cworkflow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20flow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20-%20flow%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer ]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest usages of the term "work flow" was in a railway engineering journal from 1921.&lt;ref name="SaundersBlundstone1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence Saunders|author2=S. R. Blundstone|title=The Railway Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBbnAAAAMAAJ|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor and Gantt launched the study of the deliberate, rational organization of work, primarily in the context of manufacturing. This gave rise to [[time and motion studies]].&lt;ref name="ChatfieldVangermeersch2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Chatfield|author-link1 = Michael Chatfield |author2=Richard Vangermeersch|author-link2=Richard Vangermeersch|title=The History of Accounting (RLE Accounting): An International Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmnMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269|date=5 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-67545-6|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related concepts include [[job shop]]s and [[queuing systems]] ([[Markov chain]]s).&lt;ref name="Pinedo2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael L. Pinedo|title=Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRiDnuXSnVwC|date=7 January 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-2361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=job+shops%2Cflow+shops%2Cqueuing+systems&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cjob%20shops%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cflow%20shops%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cqueuing%20systems%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1948 book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' introduced the emerging concepts to the context of family life.

=== Maturation and growth ===
The invention of the [[typewriter]] and the [[copier]] helped spread the study of the rational organization of labor from the manufacturing shop floor to the office. Filing systems and other sophisticated systems for managing physical [[information]] flows evolved. Several events likely contributed to the development of formalized information workflows. First, the field of optimization theory matured and developed [[mathematical optimization]] techniques. For example, Soviet mathematician and economist [[Leonid Kantorovich]] developed the seeds of [[linear programming]] in 1939 through efforts to solve a plywood manufacturer's production optimization issues.&lt;ref name="KatseneliboigenTheSoviet90"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3bYoKUYXaYC&amp;pg=PA410 |chapter=Chapter 17: Nobel and Lenin Prize Laureate L.V.

=== Quality era ===
In the post-war era, the work of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran]] led to a focus on quality, initially in Japanese companies, and from the 1980s on a more global level, giving rise to a variety of movements ranging from [[total quality management]] to [[Six Sigma]], then to more qualitative notions of [[business process re-engineering]].&lt;ref name="HammerChampy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Hammer|author2=James Champy|title=Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution, A|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjvGTXgFl6cC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-180864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the quality movement, workflows, in [[knowledge economy]] sectors&lt;ref&gt;Pharma/biotech workflows [http://www.integrify.com/workflow-pharmaceuticals-biotech "Pharma-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Media workflows [http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/casestudies.html#Media-Specific "Media-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in manufacturing, became the subject of further scrutiny and optimization efforts. Acknowledgement of the dynamic and changing nature of the demands on workflows came in the form of recognition of the phenomena associated with critical paths and moving bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M.[https://www.toc-goldratt.com/content/My-Saga-to-Improve-Production "My saga to improve production." MANAGEMENT TODAY-LONDON- (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow management system ==
{{main|Workflow management system}}

A [[workflow management system]] (WfMS) is a software system for setting up, performing, and monitoring of a defined sequence of processes and tasks, with the broad goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, becoming more agile, and improving information exchange within an organization.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgSrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Workflow Management: State of the Art Versus State of the Products |title=Workflow Management Systems and Interoperability |author=Elmagarmid, A.; Di, W. |editor=Dogac, A.; Kalinichenko, L.; Özsu, T.; Sheth, A. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |pages=1–17 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems may be process-centric or data-centric, and they may represent the workflow as graphical maps. The workflow management system may also include an extensible interface so that external software applications can be integrated and provide support for wide area workflows that provide faster response times and improved productivity.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12" /&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The concept of workflow is closely related to several fields in [[operations research]] and other areas that study the nature of work, either quantitatively or qualitatively, such as [[artificial intelligence]] (in particular, the sub-discipline of AI planning) and [[ethnography]]. The term "workflow" is more commonly used in particular industries, such as in printing or professional domains such as [[Clinical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], where it may have particular specialized meanings.

# '''Processes''': A process is a more general notion than workflow and can apply to, for example, physical or biological processes, whereas a workflow is typically a process or collection of processes described in the context of work, such as all processes occurring in a machine shop.
# '''Planning and [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]]''': A plan is a description of the logically necessary, partially ordered set of activities required to accomplish a specific goal given certain starting conditions. A plan, when augmented with a schedule and [[resource allocation]] calculations, completely defines a particular ''instance'' of systematic processing in pursuit of a goal. A workflow may be viewed as an often optimal or near-optimal realization of the mechanisms required to execute the same plan repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Artem M. Chirkin, Sergey V. Kovalchuk | title = Towards Better Workflow Execution Time Estimation | journal = IERI Procedia | volume = 10 | pages = 216–223 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080 | doi = 10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Flow control (data)|Flow control]]''': This is a control concept applied to workflows, to distinguish from static control of buffers of material or orders, to mean a more dynamic control of flow speed and flow volumes in motion and in process. Such orientation to dynamic aspects is the basic foundation to prepare for more advanced job shop controls, such as [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] or just-in-sequence.
# '''In-transit visibility''': This monitoring concept applies to transported material as well as to work in process or work in progress, i.e., workflows.

== Examples ==
[[File:Business Process Modelling Workflow Schematic.svg|thumb|Business Process Modelling]]
The following examples illustrate the variety of workflows seen in various contexts:

# In machine shops, particularly [[job shop]]s and flow shops, the flow of a part through the various processing stations is a workflow.
# Insurance claims processing is an example of an information-intensive, document-driven workflow.&lt;ref name="HaveyEssential05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtabAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 |chapter=Chapter 10: Example: Human Workflow in Insurance Claims Processing |title=Essential Business Process Modeling |author=Havey, M. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |year=2005 |page=255–284 |isbn=9780596008437 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wikipedia editing can be modeled as a stochastic workflow.
# The [[Getting Things Done]] system is a model of personal workflow management for information workers.
# In software development, support and other industries, the concept of ''[[follow-the-sun]]'' describes a process of passing unfinished work across time zones.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/services/hardware/info/hw_globalsupportctr_59829873EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# In traditional offset and digital printing, the concept of workflow represents the process, people, and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that play a part in pre/post processing of print-related files, e.g., PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.
# In scientific experiments, the overall process (tasks and data flow) can be described as a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). This DAG is referred to as a workflow, e.g., Brain Imaging workflows.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Image Registration Analysis Workflow for fMRI Studies on Global Grids, [http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/AINA.2009.13 Computer.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A grid workflow environment for brain imaging analysis on distributed systems, [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.1461 Wiley.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
# In healthcare data analysis, a workflow can be used to represent a sequence of steps which compose a complex data analysis (data-search and data-manipulation steps).&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = L.

== Features and phenomenology ==
# Modeling:  Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using [[graph theory|graph]]-based formalisms like [[Petri net]]s.
# Measurement: Many of the concepts used to measure scheduling systems in [[operations research]] are useful for measuring general workflows. These include throughput, processing time, and other regular metrics.
# Specialized connotations: The term "workflow" has specialized connotations in information technology, [[document management]], and [[Document imaging|imaging]]. Since 1993, one trade consortium specifically focused on workflow management and the interoperability of workflow management systems, the [[Workflow Management Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfmc.org/index.php/about-us |title=Introduction to the Workflow Management Coalition |publisher=Workflow Management Coalition |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Scientific workflow system]]s: Have found wide acceptance in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[cheminformatics]] in the early 2000s, where they successfully meet the need for multiple interconnected tools that handle multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows resembles the well-established tradition of [[Perl]] programming in life science research organizations, making this adoption a natural step towards more structured infrastructure setup.
# Human-machine interaction: Several conceptualizations of mixed-initiative workflows have been studied, particularly in the military, where automated agents play roles just as humans do. For innovative, adaptive, and collaborative human work, the techniques of [[human interaction management]] are required.
# Workflow analysis: Workflow systems allow users to develop executable processes with no familiarity with formal programming concepts. Automated workflow analysis techniques can help users analyze the properties of user workflows to conduct verification of certain properties before executing them, e.g., analyzing flow control or data flow. Examples of tools based on formal analysis frameworks have been developed and used for the analysis of scientific workflows and can be extended to the analysis of other types of workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curcin | first1 = V. | last2 = Ghanem | first2 = M. | last3 = Guo | first3 = Y. | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0157 | title = The design and implementation of a workflow analysis tool | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 368 | issue = 1926 | pages = 4193 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.4193C | url = https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60972131/4193.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow improvement theories ==
Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

# [[Six Sigma]]
# [[Total Quality Management]]
# [[Business Process Reengineering]]
# [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] systems
# [[Theory of Constraints]]

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human, is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating A Performance Based Culture In Your Workplace|last=Alvord|first=Brice|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=1105576078|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
A workflow can usually be described using formal or informal flow diagramming techniques, showing directed flows between processing steps. Single processing steps or components of a workflow can basically be defined by three parameters:
#input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step
#transformation rules: [[algorithm]]s which may be carried out by people or machines, or both
#output description: the information, material, and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps

Components can only be plugged together if the output of one previous (set of) component(s) is equal to the mandatory input requirements of the following component(s). Thus, the essential description of a component actually comprises only input and output that are described fully in terms of [[data type]]s and their meaning ([[semantics]]). The algorithms' or rules' descriptions need only be included when there are several alternative ways to transform one type of input into one type of output – possibly with different accuracy, speed, etc.

When the components are non-local services that are invoked remotely via a computer network, such as [[Web service]]s, additional descriptors (such as [[Quality of service|QoS]] and [[availability]]) also must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Kyriazis| title = An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal = Future Generation Computer Systems | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 498–511 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | doi = 10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{main|Workflow application}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Many software systems exist to support workflows in particular domains. Such systems manage tasks such as automatic routing, partially automated processing, and integration between different functional software applications and hardware systems that contribute to the value-addition process underlying the workflow. There are also software suppliers using the technology [[process driven messaging service]] based upon three elements{{Citation needed|reason=Couldn't find a source for any of this, and main article has no citations as well.|date=January 2018}}:
