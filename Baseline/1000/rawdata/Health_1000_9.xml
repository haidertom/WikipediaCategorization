      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9177">The '''10/90 gap''' is the term adopted by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] to highlight the finding by the [[Commission on Health Research for Development]] in 1990, that less than 10% of worldwide resources devoted to health research were put towards health in [[Developing Countries]], where over 90% of all preventable deaths worldwide occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globalforumhealth.org/about1090-gap/|title = 10/90 gap|date = 2011|accessdate = April 16, 2015|website = Global Forum for Health Research|publisher = }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the spread of disease suffered in both rich and poor countries converges. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the most prevalent diseases consist of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].  These diseases now{{When|date=June 2016}} account for 45% of the global health burden and is the culprit for up to 85% of deaths in low-income countries. The 10/90 Gap focuses on joining organisations together to reduce these statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Luchetti, M. (2014). Global health and the 10/90 gap. British Journal of Medical Practitioners, 7(4), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease and the 10/90 gap==

A substantial portion of diseases, most prevalent in impoverished or developing countries, are those which are preventable and/or treatable.&lt;ref name=Currat&gt;Currat, L.J., Francisco, A., Al-Tuwaijri, S., Ghaffar, A., &amp; Jupp, S. (2004). 10/90 report on health research 2003-2004. WHO Drug Information, 18(3), 243. Retrieved from http://announcementsfiles.cohred.org/gfhr_pub/assoc/s14789e/s14789e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (2004) stated in their world health report that an estimated eight million individuals die prematurely, from diseases and conditions that can be cured, every year. These deaths contribute to approximately one third of all human deaths in the world, each year.&lt;ref name=Currat/&gt; Table 1 lists several of these curable diseases.

==Strategies for change==

Global health organisations across the globe have explicitly made research into health their priority. In 2000, World Health Organization established the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who in their 2001 report, verified the relationship between poverty and disease and discussed the benefit of investment on the economic climates of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hotez P.J. |author2=Ferris M.T. | year = 2006 | title = The antipoverty vaccines | url = | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = 24| pages = 31–31 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible strategies that can be implanted to help reduce the 10/90 gap are, policies prioritizing funding for health research, also developing capacities of credible public and private health research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, A., Kuruvilla, S., &amp; Borchert, M. (2004). Bridging the implementation gap between knowledge and action for health. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 82(10), 724–732.&lt;/ref&gt; Also activities of international NGOs to undertake research aimed at resolving the gap, and the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kilama W. L. | year = 2009 | title = The 10/90 gap in sub-saharan africa: Resolving inequities in health research | url = | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = S8–S15 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the number of diseases that are preventable, other factors that are blocking the access of patients to these products, such as cost of treatments to the individual, also need to be addressed, rather that just focusing on developing new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 Gap|last = Stevens|first = Philip|publisher = International Policy Network|year = 2004|isbn = |location = London, UK.|pages = 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a need to build the [[primary health care]] sector in developing countries. It has been shown that early detection and effective management of disease can be provided by appropriately-trained, non-physician, healthcare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global health: Noncommunicable diseases|last = Hunter|first = D.J.|date = 2013|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1109345|pmid = |last2 = Reddy|first2 = K.S.|volume=369|pages=1336–1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health expenditure==

The gap between financial needs and financial means in low income countries can only be filled by donations. The average health expenditure per capita in western countries is estimated at $947 compared to $20 per capita in low income countries. To assist the worlds poorest, health expenditure between $44–60 per capita is placed as a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |title=Global Health and the 10/90 gap |last=Luchetti |first=Marco |date=2014 |journal=British journal of medical practitioners |issn=1757-8515 |pmid= |access-date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Y5hRlONj?url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |archivedate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This target is achieved by the contribution of 0.1% of  advanced western countries gross national production (GNP) to fund global health, this recommendation was set by the WHO in 2001 and is estimated to save 8 million lives per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development|last = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Geneva|pages = 7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research and development ==

Among other efforts to address this issue are recent proposals for a Global Research and Development ([[Research and development|R&amp;D]]) [[treaty]], and the creation of the nonprofit [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] company [[Institute for OneWorld Health|OneWorld Health]] which develops new and affordable medicines for neglected diseases. A treaty creates a system that allows health research to come from contributions by all and therefore the sharing of benefits for all, improving the fairness and sustainability of global research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Innovation and Access to Medicines for Neglected Populations: Could a Treaty Address a Broken Pharmaceutical R&amp;D System?|last = Moon|first = Suerie|date = 15 May 2012|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001218|pmid = 22615544|pmc=3352855|volume=9|pages=e1001218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a positive development for the closing of the gap, in the 2012 [[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]] many parties, including governments, funding organisations and drug companies, agreed to work towards the eradication of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development assistance for neglected tropical diseases: Progress since 2009|last = Liese|first = Bernhard H|date = 2014|journal = International Health|doi = 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052|pmid = |last2 = Houghton|first2 = Natalia|last3 = Teplitskaya|first3 = Lyubov|issue = 3|volume = 6|pages = 162–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Despite the findings of the World Health Organization, and the disparity of curable diseases throughout developing and developed countries, some people believe the 10/90 gap is a myth.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vidyasagar|first1=D|title=Global notes: The 10/90 gap disparities in global health research|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–56|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211402}}&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the fact that simple medicines which stop curable and treatable conditions such as diarrhoea and malaria are available to these countries. The issue is not with the medicine, but with the ability for the affected to access it. Access to medicine can be inhibited by many circumstances such as poverty, strict government regime and inadequate healthcare systems and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar/&gt;

'''Clinical audit''' is a process that has been defined as "a [[Continuous improvement|quality improvement]] process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit criteria and the implementation of change".&lt;ref name=nice1&gt;{{cite document |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/media/796/23/BestPracticeClinicalAudit.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work=Principles of Best Practice in Clinical Audit 2002|accessdate=Aug 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312151534/http://www.nice.org.uk/media/796/23/BestPracticeClinicalAudit.pdf|archivedate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key component of clinical audit is that performance is reviewed (or [[audit]]ed) to ensure that what you ''should'' be doing is ''being'' done, and if not it provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] to enable improvements to be made. It had been formally incorporated in the healthcare systems of a number of countries, for instance  in 1993 into the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and within the NHS there is a clinical audit guidance group in the UK. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125164148/http://www.cgsupport.nhs.uk/Resources/Clinical_Audit/1%40Introduction_and_Contents.asp].

Clinical audit comes under the [[Clinical Governance]] umbrella and forms part of the system for improving the standard of clinical practice.

==History==

One of first clinical audits was undertaken by [[Florence Nightingale]] during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–55.
On arrival at the medical barracks [[hospital]] in [[Üsküdar|Scutari]] in 1854, Nightingale was appalled by the unsanitary conditions and high [[mortality rate]]s among injured or ill soldiers. She and her team of 38 nurses applied strict sanitary routines and standards of [[hygiene]] to the hospital and equipment; in addition, Nightingale had a talent for [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], and she and her staff kept meticulous records of the mortality rates among the hospital [[patient]]s. Following these changes the [[death|mortality]] rates fell from 40% to 2%, and the results were instrumental in overcoming the resistance of the British doctors and officers to Nightingale's procedures. Her methodical approach, as well as the emphasis on uniformity and comparability of the results of health care, is recognised as one of the earliest programs of outcomes management.

Another notable figure who advocated clinical audit was [[Ernest Codman]] (1869–1940). Codman became known as the first true medical auditor following his work in 1912 on monitoring surgical outcomes. Codman's "end result idea" was to follow every patient's case history after [[surgery]] to identify errors made by individual [[surgeon]]s on specific patients. Although his work is often neglected in the history of [[Health assessment|health care assessment]], Codman's work anticipated contemporary approaches to [[Quality control|quality monitoring and assurance]], establishing accountability, and allocating and [[resource management|managing resources]] efficiently.

Whilst Codman's 'clinical' approach is in contrast with Nightingale's more '[[epidemiological]]' audits, these two methods serve to highlight the different methodologies that can be used in the process of improvement to patient outcome.

==The integration into contemporary healthcare==

Despite the successes of Nightingale in the Crimea and Codman in [[Massachusetts]], clinical audit was slow to catch on. This situation was to remain for the next 130 or so years, with only a minority of healthcare staff embracing the process as a means of evaluating the quality of care delivered to patients.

As concepts of clinical audit have developed, so too have the definitions which sought to encapsulate and explain the idea. These changes generally reflect the movement away from the medico-centric views of the mid-Twentieth Century to the more multidisciplinary approach used in modern [[healthcare]]. It also reflects the change in focus from a professionally centred view of health provision to the view of the patient-centred approach. These changes can be seen from comparison of the following definitions.

In 1989, the [[White Paper]], ''Working for patients'', saw the first move in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to standardise clinical audit as part of professional healthcare. The paper defined medical audit (as it was called then) as
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the systematic critical analysis of the quality of medical care including the procedures used for diagnosis and treatment, the use of resources and the resulting outcome and quality of life for the patient."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medical audit later evolved into clinical audit and a revised definition was announced by the [[NHS Executive]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Clinical audit is the systematic analysis of the quality of healthcare, including the procedures used for diagnosis, treatment and care, the use of resources and the resulting outcome and quality of life for the patient."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) published the paper ''Principles for Best Practice in Clinical Audit'',&lt;ref name=nice1 /&gt; which defines clinical audit as
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit criteria and the implementation of change. Aspects of the structure, processes, and outcomes of care are selected and systematically evaluated against explicit criteria. Where indicated, changes are implemented at an individual, team, or service level and further monitoring is used to confirm improvement in [[healthcare]] delivery."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of audit==

*'''Standards-based audit''' - A cycle which involves defining standards, collecting data to measure current practice against those standards, and implementing any changes deemed necessary.
*'''Adverse occurrence screening and critical incident monitoring''' - This is often used to [[peer review]] cases which have caused concern or from which there was an unexpected outcome. The multidisciplinary team discusses individual anonymous cases to reflect upon the way the team functioned and to learn for the future. In the primary care setting, this is described as a 'significant event audit'.
*'''Surgical audit''' - Data collection of all surgical cases, followed by ongoing review and assessment of performance and outcomes. Related to peer review, but is distinguished by aiming for inclusion of all cases carried out, rather than sampling alone.
*'''Peer review''' - An assessment of the quality of care provided by a clinical team with a view to improving clinical care. Individual cases are discussed by peers to determine, with the benefit of [[hindsight]], whether the best care was given. This is similar to the method described above, but might include 'interesting' or 'unusual' cases rather than problematic ones. Unfortunately, recommendations made from these reviews are often not pursued as there is no systematic method to follow.
*'''Patient surveys and focus groups''' - These are methods used to obtain users' views about the quality of care they have received.

==The place of clinical audit in modern healthcare==

[[Image:smallwhatisclingov.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Clinical audit is an essential and integral part of clinical governance.]]Clinical audit comes under the [[Clinical Governance]] umbrella and forms part of the system for improving the standard of clinical practice.

[[Clinical Governance]] is a system through which [[National Health Service|NHS]] organisations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of services; it ensures that there are clean lines of accountability within [[NHS trust]]s and that there is a comprehensive programme of quality improvement systems. The six pillars of clinical governance are:

* Clinical Effectiveness
* Research &amp; Development
* Openness
* Risk Management
* Education &amp; Training
* Clinical Audit

Clinical audit was incorporated within Clinical Governance in the 1997 [[White Paper]], "[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/newnhs/newnhs.htm The New NHS : Modern, Dependable]", which brought together disparate service improvement processes and formally established them into a coherent Clinical Governance framework.

== Management of clinical audit ==
Within [[Strategic Health Authorities]] the clinical governance lead is responsible for ensuring that there is a clinical audit programme within local trusts, and that this reflects national audit priorities. The clinical governance lead ultimately retains accountability for clinical audit, but may choose to delegate this role to another, the clinical audit lead. At a local level this individual will then be responsible for creating a clinical audit strategy, setting audit priorities, agreeing the audit programme, implementing the strategy and implementing the audit programme. The clinical governance lead however retains responsibility for ensuring that these tasks are completed and that clinical audit remains integrated with the other aspects of clinical governance.

The clinical audit lead has a clear role in creating the strategy for embedding clinical audit within the organisation, but the individual chosen must have more than just a nominal strategic role. The clinical audit lead should have a high profile within the organisation, and must champion clinical audit both to colleagues and management alike. The clinical audit lead should be actively involved in linkages to the other aspects of clinical governance to allow for the dissemination of clinical audit information and the setting of local clinical audit priorities.

== Clinical audit - the process ==
[[Image:Clinical audit cycle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The clinical audit process seeks to identify areas for service improvement, develop &amp; carry out action plans to rectify or improve service provision and then to re-audit to ensure that these changes have an effect.]] Clinical audit can be described as a cycle or a spiral, ''see figure''. Within the cycle there are stages that follow the ''systematic'' process of: establishing best practice; measuring against criteria; taking action to improve care; and monitoring to sustain improvement. As the process continues, each cycle aspires to a higher level of quality.

This stage involves the selection of a topic or issue to be audited, and is likely to involve measuring adherence to healthcare processes that have been shown to produce best outcomes for patients. Selection of an audit topic is influenced by factors including:
* where national standards and guidelines exist; where there is conclusive evidence about effective clinical practice (i.e. [[evidence-based medicine]]).
* areas where problems have been encountered in practice.
* what patients and public have recommended that be looked at.
* where there is a clear potential for improving service delivery.
* areas of high volume, high risk or high cost, in which improvements can be made.

Additionally, audit topics may be recommended by national bodies, such as [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] or the [[Healthcare Commission]], in which NHS trusts may agree to participate. The [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]] recommends a culture of audit to participating hospitals inside and outside of the UK, and can provide advice on audit topics.

'''Stage 2: Define criteria and standards'''

Decisions regarding the overall purpose of the audit, either as what should happen as a result of the audit, or what question you want the audit to answer, should be written as a series of statements or tasks that the audit will focus on. Collectively, these form the audit ''criteria''. These criteria are explicit statements that define what is being measured and represent elements of care that can be measured objectively. The ''standards'' define the aspect of care to be measured, and should always be based on the best available evidence.

* A criterion is a measurable outcome of care, aspect of practice or capacity.  For example, ‘parents / carers are involved in negotiating or planning their child’s care’.
* A standard is the threshold of the expected compliance for each criterion (these are usually expressed as a percentage).  For the above example an appropriate standard would be: ‘There is evidence of parent / carer in care planning in 90% of cases’.

'''Stage 3: Data collection'''

To ensure that the data collected are precise, and that only essential information is collected, certain details of what is to be audited must be established from the outset. These include:

* The user group to be included, with any exceptions noted.
* The healthcare professionals involved in the users' care.
* The period over which the criteria apply.

Sample sizes for data collection are often a compromise between the statistical validity of the results and pragmatical issues around data collection. Data to be collected may be available in a computerised information system, or in other cases it may be appropriate to collect data manually or electronically using data capture solutions such as [http://www.formic.com Formic], depending on the outcome being measured. In either case, considerations need to be given to what data will be collected, where the data will be found, and who will do the data collection.

Ethical issues must also be considered; the data collected must relate only to the objectives of the audit, and staff and patient confidentiality must be respected - identifiable information must not be used. Any potentially sensitive topics should be discussed with the local [[Medical ethics|Research Ethics Committee]].

'''Stage 4: Compare performance with criteria and standards'''

This is the analysis stage, whereby the results of the data collection are compared with criteria and standards. The end stage of analysis is concluding how well the standards were met and, if applicable, identifying reasons why the standards weren't met in all cases. These reasons might be agreed to be acceptable, i.e. could be added to the exception criteria for the standard in future, or will suggest a focus for improvement measures.

In theory, any case where the standard (criteria or exceptions) was not met in 100% of cases suggests a potential for improvement in care. In practice, where standard results were close to 100%, it might be agreed that any further improvement will be difficult to obtain and that other standards, with results further away from 100%, are the priority targets for action. This decision will depend on the topic area – in some ‘life or death’ type cases, it will be important to achieve 100%, in other areas a much lower result might still be considered acceptable.

'''Stage 5: Implementing change'''

Once the results of the audit have been published and discussed, an agreement must be reached about the recommendations for change. Using an action plan to record these recommendations is good practice; this should include who has agreed to do what and by when. Each point needs to be well defined, with an individual named as responsible for it, and an agreed timescale for its completion.

Action plan development may involve refinement of the audit tool particularly if measures used are found to be inappropriate or incorrectly assessed. In other instances new process or outcome measures may be needed or involve linkages to other departments or individuals. Too often audit results in criticism of other organisations, departments or individuals without their knowledge or involvement. Joint audit is far more profitable in this situation and should be encouraged by the Clinical Audit lead and manager.

'''Re-audit: Sustaining Improvements'''

After an agreed period, the audit should be repeated. The same strategies for identifying the sample, methods and data analysis should be used to ensure comparability with the original audit. The re-audit should demonstrate that the changes have been implemented and that improvements have been made. Further changes may then be required, leading to additional re-audits.

This stage is critical to the successful outcome of an audit process - as it verifies whether the changes implemented have had an effect and to see if further improvements are required to achieve the standards of healthcare delivery identified in stage 2.

Results of good audit should be disseminated both locally via the [[Strategic Health Authorities]] and nationally where possible.
Professional journals, such as the [[BMJ]] and the [[Nursing Standard]] publish the findings of good quality audits, especially if the work or the methodology is generalisable.

== Persuading hospitals and clinicians to undertake and apply clinical audit ==

While clinical audit makes great sense, there can be problems in persuading hospitals and clinicians to undertake and apply clinical audit in their work. Nonetheless, in the UK clinical audit is one of the corpus of [[clinical governance]] measures that are required to be enacted throughout the NHS.

Outside the UK, [[hospital accreditation]] schemes, such as the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]], have promoted the development and execution of clinical audit as a part of [[clinical governance]] in places such as Hong Kong and Malta.

The most recent edition is the [https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans]. The nominal purpose of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is to help [[health professionals]] and policymakers to advise Americans about healthy choices for their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Although the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are purported to be based on a systematic review of the current body of nutrition science, the Advisory Committee tasked with formulating the plan for retrieval and analysis of the scientific evidence for the current edition of the DGA used a less than rigorous process for assessing the health effects of consumption of saturated fat and salt and for assessing the health effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. This less than rigorous review of the nutrition science literature resulted in omission of multiple large, high-quality, clinical trials and also omission of some high-quality prospective observational studies. Some Advisory Committee members also had conflicts-of-interest&lt;ref&gt;Garduno-Diaz, Sara Diana, Brooke Aksnes, and Maria Alvim Leite.

==History==
{{Main|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
The efforts of the [[US Federal Government]] to establish a scientific basis for [[human nutrition]] began with [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/nutrition/|title=nutrition : USDA ARS|website=Ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published the first dietary recommendations for Americans in 1894, notably stating that, "We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/hist/oes_1894_farm_bul_23.pdf |title=Farmer's Bulletin |last=Arwater |first=W |date=1894 |website=Ars.usda.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has been published every 5 years beginning in 1980, producing eight guidelines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/history.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans - History|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consistent recommendation of these eight guidelines has been that Americans reduce their dietary consumption of fat and animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs and to increase their dietary consumption of carbohydrates and plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Dietary guidelines for Americans, 1980 TO 2000. www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/1980_2000_chart.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Guidelines were established so as to provide dietary advice that would improve the health of Americans and reduce their risk for [[chronic conditions]], such as [[cancer]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[hypertension]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], and [[renal disease]]. The Dietary Guidelines have the purpose of guiding the development of Federal policies and programs related to food, nutrition, and health.  The guidelines influence and guide policymakers for Federally-financed food and dietary education programs. They also influence clinicians in the United States and in other countries.

The intended audience for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are policymakers, [[food science|nutrition scientists]], and [[dieticians]] and other [[health professionals]]. The Guidelines themselves are not intended to directly inform the general public, but instead to serve as an authoritative, evidence-based information source that policymakers and health professionals can use to advise Americans about making healthy choices in their daily lives so as to enjoy a healthy diet that also prevents chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide an evidence-base that is used by the Federal government to develop nutrition education materials for Americans.

Federal law and regulation require that Federal government publications provide dietary guidance consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  For the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) the guidelines provide the scientific rationale for the [[National School Lunch Program]] and [[School Breakfast Program]], feeding 30 million children every school day, and the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]], which has 8 million beneficiaries. For the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] [[Administration on Aging]], the guidelines provide the rationale for the [[Older Americans Act]] Nutrition Services programs which include more than 5,000 community-based nutrition service providers (e.g., [[Meals on Wheels]]), serving more than 900,000 meals a day across the United States. The [[Department of Defense]] uses the guidelines as the rationale for meal rations for military personnel and the [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] uses the guidelines to inform nutrition education for veterans who are patients of the VA Hospital System. In addition to these governmental audiences, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are widely used by state and local governments, schools, commercial enterprises, community groups, the media, and the food industry to inform policy and program development intended to serve the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/introduction/dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=The Dietary Guidelines for Americans: What It Is, What It Is Not - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelineswebsite=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current guidelines==
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020) were developed in three stages, beginning with a review of scientific evidence, followed by development of the guidelines, and finally with implementation of the guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to previous guidelines, the 2015–2020 guidelines put emphasize replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats, with the goal of preventing heart attack and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Dong D., and Frank B. Hu. "Dietary fat and risk of cardiovascular disease: recent controversies and advances." Annual review of nutrition 37 (2017): 423-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines provide a general recommendation that people follow a healthy eating pattern with appropriate calories, and that the evaluation of ones eating pattern accounts for all foods and beverages, including snacks. The recommended healthy eating pattern includes:

Include these in diet:
* A broad selection of vegetables, including dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starches (potatoes, rice, pasta, bread), and others
* An emphasis on whole fruits
* An emphasis on whole grains
* Dairy products that are either fat-free or low fat, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages
* Protein foods to include seafood, lean meats,  poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Summary - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines |website=Health.gov |url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/executive-summary/ |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en |date=2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limit these in diet:
* Trans fats
* Saturated fats to less than 10% of calories
* Added sugars to less than 10% of calories
* Sodium to less than 2.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day (5.8 g of salt/day), including both added table salt and salt in foods
* If consumed, use alcohol in moderation and only for adults — up to 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men.&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines also include a key recommendation to meet the [[Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans]].&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The [[MyPlate]] initiative, based on the recommendations of the 2015 -2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and produced by the [[USDA]] [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]], is a nutrition education program directed at the general public, providing a guide to "finding healthy eating solutions to fit your lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/myplate-mywins|title=MyPlate, MyWins|date=12 December 2016|website=Choosemyplate.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future guidelines==
The USDA has invited interested parties, including members of the general public, to participate and follow the development of the 2020 - 2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Welcome to the portal for you to participate and follow the development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; As mandated by the [[Agriculture Act of 2014]], this next edition of the guidelines will cover the full life-span of Americans, as expansion of the guidelines are planned to include recommendations for pregnant women, infants, and children younger than 2 years old. The Trump Administration has proposed a budget of more than $12 million for the evaluation of scientific evidence, development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and dissemination of the new edition to its target audience of policymakers, nutrition experts, and clinicians; this budget request has been supported by multiple organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/on-the-pulse-of-public-policy/from-the-hill/academy-supports-funding-2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-for-americans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines==
Each edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans has had attendant controversy, with objections particularly from scientists whose point-of-view was not reflected in the guidelines and from commercial interests negatively affected by the recommendations therein.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle M. Perspective: Challenges and Controversial Issues in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 1980–2015. Advances in Nutrition. 2018 Mar 1;9(2):148-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the 2015-2020 guidelines was particularly contentious,&lt;ref&gt;Hite, Adele H., and Pamela Schoenfeld. "Open letter to the secretaries of the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services on the creation of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans." Nutrition 31, no. 5 (2015): 776-779.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in action by Congress mandating the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to evaluate the process used to update the DGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/congress-we-need-to-review-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=Congress: We need to review the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review by the National Academies resulted in two reports. The first report, entitled "Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process", identified opportunities for improving the process for selecting members of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2017/optimizing-the-process-for-establishing-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans-the-selection-process.aspx|title=Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process : Health and Medicine Division|website=nationalacademies.org|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2018 the [[USDA]] issued an official response to the first report of the National Academies committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/HMDRecommendations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second report from National Academies of Sciences, entitled "Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans", offers an exhaustive review and provides recommendations for improving the process of revising the Dietary Guidelines so as to best identify, analyze, and present the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24883/chapter/1#ix|title=Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|date=16 November 2017|website=Nap.edu|accessdate=1 July 2018|doi=10.17226/24883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===

One critic contends that the current guidelines do not promote the public interest and have been corrupted by [[regulatory capture]], advancing the commercial concerns of [[agribusiness]] and large food processors, and the political concerns of scientists intent on preserving their point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Paarlberg, Robert. "Governing the dietary transition: Linking agriculture, nutrition, and health." Edited by Shenggen Fan and Rajul Pandya-Lorch (2012): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic notes that the DGAs make recommendations that overvalue the findings of observational studies and surrogate measures of outcomes and that undervalue the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Nissen, Steven E 2016"/&gt;

There is compelling evidence that [[food frequency questionnaires]] and other methods that rely on human memory do not accurately measure dietary intake.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "A discussion of the refutation of memory-based dietary assessment methods (M-BMs): the rhetorical defense of pseudoscientific and inadmissible evidence." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 12, pp. 1736-1739. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the validity of the methods used by the USDA to estimate per capita calorie consumption found that these methods lack validity and the authors of this study recommend that these methods not be used to inform public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Diana M. Thomas, Samantha M. McDonald, Gregory Pavela, Carl J. Lavie, James O. Hill, and Steven N. Blair. "The Validity of US Nutritional Surveillance: USDA’s Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data Series 1971-2010." Current problems in cardiology 41, no. 11-12 (2016): 268-292.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review found that only a few studies have measured the accuracy or reliability of dietary assessment methods in schoolchildren. The few studies that have been done found that schoolchildren did not accurately report foods consumed but that they did accurately report total calories consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Tugault-Lafleur, Claire N., Jennifer L. Black, and Susan I. Barr. "A Systematic Review of Methods to Assess Children's Diets in the School Context–." Advances in Nutrition 8, no. 1 (2017): 63-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Guidelines were based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidance Advisory Committee|website=Health.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not rely on actual measurements of dietary intake but instead relied on memory-based dietary assessments, including interviews and surveys despite clear evidence that such methods markedly underestimate actual calorie consumption and nutrient intake.  Thus, the conclusions expressed in the Scientific Report have been criticized, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are considered invalid by some experts, as the DGAs rely on invalid methods and draw conclusions that do not agree with the available scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "The inadmissibility of what we eat in America and NHANES dietary data in nutrition and obesity research and the scientific formulation of national dietary guidelines." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 7, pp. 911-926. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Fat Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that is low in total fat, and for not adequately emphasizing the harmful effect of industrially-produced trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nita Forouhi|Forouhi, Nita G.]], Ronald M. Krauss, Gary Taubes, and Walter Willett. "Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance." BMJ 361 (2018): k2139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Nina. The big fat surprise: why butter, meat and cheese belong in a healthy diet. Simon and Schuster, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review of 62,421 participants in 10 dietary trials found that reducing dietary fat intake had no effect on coronary heart disease and had no effect on overall mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis conclude that the available evidence from randomized controlled trials does not support the recommendation of the 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that people reduce their fat intake.&lt;ref&gt;Harcombe, Zoë, Julien S. Baker, James J. DiNicolantonio, Fergal Grace, and Bruce Davies. "Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis." Open Heart 3, no. 2 (2016): e000409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Salt Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that contains less than 2.3&amp;nbsp; grams of sodium (5.8 grams of salt/day). Notably, 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily and evidence on the [[health effects of salt]] does not support such a severe restriction on salt intake. An analysis of dietary guidelines found that this recommendation for restriction of salt intake is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]], which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality. The authors of this analysis suggest a redesign of the dietary guidelines for salt intake is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Graudal, Niels, and Gesche Jürgens. "Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines." Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A Committee of the National Academies [[Institute of Medicine]] evaluated the evidence about dietary salt intake and health. Overall, the committee found evidence that higher salt intake was associate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the Committee also found that the evidence did not support the claim that lowering sodium intake in the general population to less than 2,300&amp;nbsp;mg/day was associated with a lower risk of death nor with a higher risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18311/sodium-intake-in-populations-assessment-of-evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcoholic Beverage Consumption===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting alcoholic beverages consumption to no more than 1 drink daily for women and no more than 2 drinks daily for men. The 2015 - 2020 Scientific Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee asserts that most studies show that moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown to be part of a beneficial dietary pattern. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of scientific studies of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality found that consumption of up to 2 alcoholic beverages per day had no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, Tim, Jinhui Zhao, Sapna Panwar, Audra Roemer, Timothy Naimi, and Tanya Chikritzhs. "Do “moderate” drinkers have reduced mortality risk? A systematic review and meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality." Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs 77, no. 2 (2016): 185-198.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 |journal=Lancet |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=August 2018 |pmid=30146330 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31310-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guidelines recommend that people not mix alcohol and beverages containing caffeine, as this combined intake may result in greater alcohol consumption, with a greater risk of alcohol-related injury.

===Classification of honey and maple syrup as "Added sugars"===
Producers of honey and maple syrup have objected to the proposed Federal regulatory requirement that honey and maple syrup include the term "added sugar" on product labeling, despite the fact that no additional sugar is added to these products. This regulatory requirement follows from the recommendation in the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines that added sugars be limited to less than 10% of calories and that honey and maple syrup are themselves considered by federal regulators to be added sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-vermont-pure-outrage-over-pure-syrup-1530031226|title=In Vermont, Pure Outrage Over Pure Syrup|first=Betsy|last=McKay|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

Although digital therapeutics can be employed in numerous ways, the term can broadly be defined as a treatment or therapy that utilizes digital and often [[Internet]]-based health technologies to spur changes in patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dietitian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Yeager| first=David| title =Fighting Chronic Disease With Digital Therapeutics| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Today's Dietitian''| date =November 2014 | url =http://www.todaysdietitian.com/enewsletter/enews_1114_01.shtml| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of digital products to improve health outcomes dates as far back as 2000&lt;ref name="Frontiers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webb |first=Thomas L. |last2= Joseph|first2=Judith| last3=Yardley |first3=Lucy| last4=Michie| first4= Susan| date=17 February 2010 |title=Using the Internet to Promote Health Behavior Change: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Impact of Theoretical Basis, Use of Behavior Change Techniques, and Mode of Delivery on Efficacy |url=http://www.jmir.org/2010/1/e4/ |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages= e92|doi=10.2196/jmir.4052 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term itself has been in use since around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn85765357&amp;docId=FTK20121101070417#docIndex=4&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of the term in a peer-reviewed research publication was in 2015, in which Dr. Cameron Sepah formally defined the field as: "Digital therapeutics are evidence-based behavioral treatments delivered online that can increase accessibility and effectiveness of health care."&lt;ref name="JMIR01" /&gt; Digital therapeutics can be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with more conventional treatments like pharmacological or in-person therapy.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; As of 2018, digital therapeutics continues to be an evolving field that medical professionals, students, and patients are beginning to utilize.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Ber |first=Jeanne M. |last2=Lombardo |first2=Nancy T.| last3=Wimmer |first3=Erin | date=22 January 2015|title=Building Technology Services That Address Student Needs |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |journal=Medical Reference Services Quarterly|publisher= |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages= 1–16|doi=10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used as a preventive measure for patients who are at risk of developing more serious conditions. For instance, a patient with [[prediabetes]] may be prescribed digital therapeutics as a method to change their diet and behavior that could otherwise lead to a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNTime"/&gt; Digital therapeutics can also be used as a treatment option for existing conditions. For instance, a patient with type II diabetes can use digital therapeutics to manage the disease more effectively.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;

The methodology uses a variety of digital implements to help manage, monitor, and prevent illnesses in at-risk patients. These include [[mobile devices]] and technologies, [[Mobile app|apps]], sensors, [[desktop computers]], and various [[Internet of Things]] devices.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kvedar| first=Joseph| title =It’s time to break free of the traditional paradigms of disease management| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Med City News| date =25 August 2016 | url =http://medcitynews.com/2016/08/time-break-free-traditional-paradigms-disease-management/| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These implements can collect a wide variety of data, ranging from [[Big data|big]] to small. Digital therapeutics can theoretically collect a high volume of data from a variety of sources. It also collects "smaller" data, "capturing personalized physiological parameters, behavior patterns and social and geographical patterns that can be recorded from multiple digital sources."&lt;ref name="Drug"/&gt;

==Methodologies==

Digital therapeutics can be used for a variety of conditions. There is no single methodology used in the practice of digital therapeutics. It uses methods rooted in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] to spur patients to make lifestyle changes. The method can be used to manage and prevent numerous conditions, including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, congestive heart failure, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], asthma, [[lung disease]], obesity, substance abuse, ADHD, [[insomnia]], [[panic attack]]s, anxiety, depression, and others.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNDigit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahlberg |first=Leif E. |last2= Grahn |first2=Daniel| last3=Dahlberg |first3=Jakob E. |last4=Thorstensson |first4= Carina A.| date=2016 |title=A Web-Based Platform for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Hip and Knee: A Pilot Study |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leif_Dahlberg/publication/303801480_A_Web-Based_Platform_for_Patients_With_Osteoarthritis_of_the_Hip_and_Knee_A_Pilot_Study/links/5756a3ac08aec74acf5acd9d.pdf |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= e115|doi=10.2196/resprot.5665 |access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodologies can be as simple as sending notifications designed to alter behavior to patients who are at risk of obesity or diabetes&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt; and as complex as administering an ingestible radio tag that communicates with an external sensor to monitor the efficacy of a given medication.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt; Diabetes and obesity prevention and management is a major focus in the field of digital therapeutics.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willey |first=Steven |last2=Walsh|first2=James K.| date=8 January 2016 |title=Outcomes of a Mobile Health Coaching Platform: 12-Week Results of a Single-Arm Longitudinal Study |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= e3|doi=10.2196/mhealth.4933 |pmid=26747611 |pmc=4723727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vlachopapadopoulou |first1=Elpis |last2=Fotiadis |first2=Dimitrios I. |editor-last=Moumtzoglou |editor-first=Anastasius |title=M-Health Innovations for Patient-Centered Care |publisher=IGI Global |date=26 January 2016 |orig-year= |pages=126–146 |chapter=Chapter 7: The Contribution of mHealth in the Care of Obese Pediatric Patients |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fQB6CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Digital+therapeutics%22&amp;ots=dfrCtFMlHe&amp;sig=sTxVvATahb5uy3gDfszcE4V1-Mk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Digital%20therapeutics%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1466698611 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connected devices like [[insulin pump]]s, [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]], and wearable gadgets can all send data to a unified system. The therapy also uses self-reported data like diet or other lifestyle factors.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; It is also often used to monitor the potential for heart and lung conditions and change behaviors like smoking, poor diet, or a lack of exercise.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;

Digital therapeutics can also be used to treat patients with psychological and neurological disorders. For example, patients with disorders like ADHD, depression, and anxiety can receive cognitive behavioral therapy via their mobile devices.&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; One study looked at the efficacy of [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]-based therapeutic interventions to reduce depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="Avatar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pinto |first=Melissa D. |last2= Greenblatt |first2=Amy M.| last3=Hickman |first3=Ronald L. |last4=Rice |first4= Heather M.| last5=Thomas|first5=Tami L. |last6=Clochesy |first6=John M. | date=19 March 2015 |title=Assessing the Critical Parameters of eSMART-MH: A Promising Avatar-Based Digital Therapeutic Intervention to Reduce Depressive Symptoms |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppc.12112/abstract |journal= Perspectives in Psychiatric Care|publisher= |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= 157–168|doi=10.1111/ppc.12112 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study demonstrated that a 4-week at-home treatment eliminated or reduced panic attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Outcomes==

The general consensus among researchers in the field of digital therapeutics is that the discipline requires more clinical data and investigation to be fully evaluated.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; A variety of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and impact of behavior change techniques that utilize a digital platform, however.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt; In a meta-analysis of 85 such studies comprising a total sample size of over 43,000 participants, researchers discovered that digital therapeutics have a "statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior." The study also showed that a broader use of theory, behavior change techniques, and modes of delivery (especially regular notifications) improved the efficacy of a given program.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;

Individual studies have also showed some benefits for patients. For instance, a diabetes prevention program using digital therapeutics saw participants lose an average of 4.7% of baseline body weight after 1 year (4.2% after 2 years) and undergo a 0.38% reduction in [[Glycated hemoglobin|A1c]] levels after 1 year (0.43% after 2 years).&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; Another weight loss pilot program using digital therapeutics reported a mean weight loss of 13.5 pounds (or 7.3% of baseline) with a significant average drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (18.6 mmHg and 6.4 mmHg respectively). The study also saw a slight but statistically insignificant drop in total cholesterol, [[LDL]], [[triglycerides]], and A1c.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt;

The world's poor are significantly more likely to have or incur a [[disability]] within their lifetime compared to more financially privileged populations. The rate of disability within impoverished nations is notably higher than that found in more [[developed countries]]. Though no one explanation entirely accounts for this connection, recently{{since when?|date=August 2014}} there has been a substantial amount of research illustrating the cycle by which poverty and disability are mutually reinforcing. Physical, cognitive, mental, emotional, sensory, or developmental impairments independently or in tandem with one another may increase one's likelihood of becoming impoverished, while living in poverty may increase one's potential of having or acquiring special needs in some capacity.

==Extent==
[[File:Disable begger in Dhaka.JPG|thumbnail|Man with disabilities in Bangladesh]]
A multitude of studies have been shown to demonstrate a significant rate of [[disability]] among individuals living in [[poverty]]. People with disabilities were shown by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] to comprise 15 to 20 percent of the poorest individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."&gt;Elwan, A. (1999). Poverty and disability: A review of the literature. The World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Former World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]] has stated that this connection reveals a link that should be broken. He stated, “People with disabilities in developing countries are over-represented among the poorest people. They have been largely overlooked in the development agenda so far, but the recent focus on poverty reduction strategies is a unique change to rethink and rewrite that agenda.”&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;The World Bank. (2011). Poverty and disability. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:20193783~menuPK:419389~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The link between disability and development has been further stressed by [[Judith Heumann]], the World Bank's first advisor for international [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]], who indicated that of the 650 million people living with disabilities today eighty percent live in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov"&gt;The Office of Policy Planning and Public Diplomacy. (2012). Special advisor Heumann's remarks on inclusive development. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311193836/http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some research investigations with proved social impact are opening venues that lead to establish enabling factors to break the cycle of deprivation faced by poor people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00450|title=It also helped refine international approaches to the education of the disabled. [Social Impact]. RECOUP. Research Consortium on Educational Outcomes and Poverty (2005-2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department for International Development|United Kingdom Department for International Development]], 10,000 individuals with disabilities die each day as a result of extreme poverty, showing that the connection between these two constructs is especially problematic and deep-seated.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is also present in developed countries, with the Disability Funders Network reporting that in the United States alone those with disabilities are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than those without special needs.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy"&gt;Dickson, J. (2011). Philanthropy's Blind Spot: The Disability Rights Movement. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the World Bank, “Persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as less education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and higher poverty rates.”&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). Disability: Overview. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:21151218~menuPK:282706~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have demonstrated that these reduced outcomes may be attributed to a myriad of institutional barriers and other factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of disabilities in impoverished populations has been predicted to follow a cyclical pattern by which those who live in poverty are more likely to acquire a disability and those who have a disability are more likely to become impoverished.

===The vicious circle===
Experts from the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council attribute the connection between disability and poverty to many systemic factors that promote a “vicious circle.”&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics affirm the mutually reinforcing nature of special needs and low socioeconomic status, showing that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to become impoverished and people who are impoverished are significantly more likely to become disabled. Barriers presented for those with disabilities can lead individuals to be deprived of access to essential resources, such as opportunities for education and employment, thus causing them to fall into poverty. Likewise, poverty places individuals at a much greater risk of acquiring a disability due to the general lack of health care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe working conditions that the poor are subject to.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt;

Experts assert that this cycle is perpetuated mainly by the lack of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] afforded to those living in poverty. The few options available to the poor often necessitate that these individuals put themselves in harms way, consequently resulting in an increase in the acquisition of preventable impairments.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Living in poverty is also shown to decrease an individual's access to preventative health services, which results in an increase in the acquisition of potentially preventable disabilities. In a study by [[Oxfam]], the organization found that well over half of the instances of childhood blindness and hearing impairment in Africa and Asia were considered preventable or treatable.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, H. (1999). Discussion paper for Oxfam: Disability as a development issue and how to integrate a disability perspective into the SCO. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate released by Oxfam provides further evidence of this vicious circle, finding that 100 million people living in poverty suffer from impairments acquired due to malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Discrimination
Prejudice held against individuals with disabilities, otherwise termed [[ableism]], is shown to be a significant detriment to the successful outcomes of persons in this population. According to one study following the lives of children with disabilities in South Africa, the children in the sample described "discrimination from other metal children and adults in the community as their most significant daily problem."&lt;ref name="Clacherty"&gt;Clacherty, G., Matsha, K., &amp; Sait, W. (2004). How do children with disabilities experience poverty, disability, and service? Cape Town, South Africa: Idasa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional forms of discrimination may lead disability to be more salient in already [[social exclusion|marginalized]] populations. Women and individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups who have disabilities have been found to more greatly suffer from discrimination and endure negative outcomes. Some researchers attribute this to what they believe is a “double rejection” of girls and women who are disabled on the basis of their sex in tandem with their special needs.&lt;ref name="Coleridge"&gt;Coleridge, P. (1993). Disability, liberation, and development. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes that accompany both of these attributes lead females with disabilities to be seen as particularly dependent upon others and serve to amplify the misconception of this population as burdensome.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; In a study done by Oxfam, the societal consequences of having a disability while belonging to an already marginalized population were highlighted, stating, “A disabled women suffers a multiple handicap. Her chances of marriage are very slight, and she is most likely to be condemned to a twilight existence as a non-productive adjunct to the household of her birth… it is small wonder that many disabled female babies do not survive.”&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Additionally, women with disabilities are particularly susceptible to abuse. A 2004 UN survey in Orissa, India, found that every women with disabilities in their sample had experienced some form of physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "&gt;United Nations. (2012). Fact sheet on persons with disabilities. Webaccessed: http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This double discrimination is also shown to be prevalent in more industrialized nations. In the United States, for example, 72 percent of women with disabilities live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The intensified discrimination individuals with disabilities may face due to their sex is especially important to consider when taking into account that, according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], women report higher incidences of disability than men.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Furthermore, the connection between disability and poverty holds particular significance for the world's women, with females accounting for roughly 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (2010). Integrating poverty and gender into health programs. The World Health Organization Webaccessed: http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/Nutritionmodule2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional discrimination also exists as there are policies existing in organizations that result in inequality between a disabled person and non-disabled person. Some of these organizations systematically ignore the needs of disabled people and some interfere in their lives as a means of social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Colin|date=1994|title=Institutional discrimination, disabled people and inter professional care|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2014.969831|journal=Journal of Interprofessional Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=203-212|doi=10.3109/13561829409010420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Another reason individuals living with disabilities are often impoverished is the high [[health care|medical costs]] associated with their needs. One study, conducted in villages in South India, demonstrated that the annual cost of treatment and equipment needed for individuals with disabilities in the area ranged from three days of income to upwards of two years' worth, with the average amount spent on essential services totaling three months worth of income.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, S., &amp; Harriss-White, B. (2001). ''The Economic Impact and Developmental Implications of Disability and Incapacity in Adulthood: a village study in South India''. Cambridge: Welfare, Demography, and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not take into account the unpaid work of caregivers who must provide assistance after these procedures and the opportunity costs leading to a loss of income during injury, surgery, and rehabilitation.
Studies reported by medical anthropologists Benedicte Ingstad and Susan Reynolds Whyte have also shown that access to medical care is significantly impaired when one lacks mobility. They report that in addition to the direct medical costs associated with special needs, the burden of transportation falls most heavily on those with disabilities. This is especially true for the rural poor whose distance from urban environments necessitates extensive movement in order to obtain health services.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;Ingstad, B. &amp; Whyte, S. R. (2007). ''Disability in Local and Global Worlds''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these barriers, both economic and physical, it is estimated that only 2 percent of individuals with disabilities have access to adequate rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Despouy, 1993, Human Rights and Disabled Persons (Study Series 6), Centre for Human Rights Geneva and UN New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaccessibility of health care for those living in poverty has a substantial impact on the rate of disability within this population.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Individuals living in poverty face higher health risks and are often unable to obtain proper treatment, leading them to be significantly more likely to acquire a disability within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Financial barriers are not the only obstacles those living in poverty are confronted with. Research shows that matters of geographic inaccessibility, availability, and cultural limitations all provide substantial impediments to the acquisition of proper care for the populations of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. H., Garg, A., Bloom, G., Walker, D. G., Brieger, W. R., &amp; Rahman, H. (2008). "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Brieger2/publication/229569366_Poverty_and_Access_to_Health_Care_in_Developing_Countries/links/59e39a3a458515393d5b8faf/Poverty-and-Access-to-Health-Care-in-Developing-Countries.pdf Poverty and access to health care in developing countries]". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. doi:10.1196&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-specific ailments are particularly harmful for women living in poverty. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that each year 20 million women acquire disabilities due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth that could be significantly mitigated with proper pre-natal, childbirth, and post-natal medical care.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"&gt;DFID (2000). Disability, poverty, and development. The Department for International Development. Webaccessed: http://www.handicap-international.fr/bibliographie-handicap/4PolitiqueHandicap/hand_pauvrete/DFID_disability.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers to care are present in the lack of treatments developed to target [[diseases of poverty]]. Experts assert that the diseases most commonly affecting those in poverty attract the least research funding. This discrepancy, known as the [[10/90 gap]], reveals that only 10 percent of global health research focuses on conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, P. (2004) Diseases of poverty and the 10/90 gap. The World Health Organization. Webaccessed: http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without a redistribution in research capital, it is likely that many of the diseases known to cause death and disability in impoverished populations will persist.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

===Institutional barriers===
Researchers assert that institutional barriers play a substantial role in the incidence of poverty in those with disabilities.

====[[Accessibility]]====
Physical environment may be a large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie, R. (1996). Disability and the city: International perspectives. London: Chapman.&lt;/ref&gt; This "apartheid" has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt; Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="Clacherty"/&gt; Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of [[Braille]], [[sign language]] and shortage of audio tape availability for those who are blind and deaf.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt;

====Education====
The roots of unemployment are speculated to begin with discrimination at an early age. [[UNESCO]] reports that 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are denied access to formal education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, at least 40 million children with disabilities do not receive an education thus barring them from obtaining knowledge essential to gainful employment and forcing them to grow up to be financially dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; This is also reflected in a finding obtained by the [[World Development Report]] that 77 percent of persons with disabilities are illiterate.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."/&gt; This statistic is even more jarring for women with disabilities, with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] reporting that the global literacy rate for this population is a mere 1 percent.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; This may be attributed to the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, boys with disabilities are significantly more likely to receive an education than similarly abled girls.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"/&gt; Beyond simply the skills obtained, experts such as former World Bank advisor [[Judith Heumann]] speculate that the societal value of education and the inability of schools to accommodate special needs children substantially contributes to the discrimination of these individuals.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; It is important to note that the deprivation of education to individuals with special needs may not be solely an issue of discrimination, but an issue of resources. Children with disabilities often require [[Special education|specialized educational]] resources and teaching practices largely unavailable in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action on Disability and Development (1998). ADD Uganda annual report. Kampala: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
Some sociologists have found a number of barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. These may be seen in [[workplace discrimination|employer discrimination]], architectural barriers within the workplace, pervasive negative attitudes regarding skill, and the adverse reactions of customers.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, W.H., &amp; Wilder, E.I. (2005). Voices from the heartland: The needs and rights of individuals with disabilities. Brookline, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Edward Hall, "More disabled people are unemployed, in lower status occupations, on low earnings, or out of the labour market altogether, than non-disabled people."&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, R. &amp; Parr, H. (1999). Mind and body spaces: geographies of illness, impairment, and disability. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that roughly 386 million of the world's working age population have some form of disability, however, up to eighty percent of these employable individuals with disabilities are unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Statistics show that individuals with disabilities in both industrialized and developing countries are generally unable to obtain formal work. In India, only 100,000 of the country's 70 million individuals with disabilities are employed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; In the United States, 14.3 of a projected 48.9 million people with disabilities were employed, with two-thirds of those unemployed reporting that they were unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Similarly in Belgium, only 30 percent of persons with disabilities were able to find gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, R. (2000). [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf Disability issues, trends and recommendations for the World Bank]. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 45 percent of adults with disabilities were found to live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable data on the rate of unemployment for persons with disabilities has yet to be determined in most developing countries.

Sociologists Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer demonstrated that this exclusion of persons with disabilities from the paid labor market is a primary reason why the majority of this population experiences far greater levels of poverty and are more reliant on the financial support of others.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; In addition to the economic gains associated with employment, researchers have shown that participation in the formal economic sector reduces discrimination of persons with disabilities. One anthropologist who chronicled the lives of persons with disabilities in Botswana noted that individuals who were able to find [[informal sector|formal employment]] “will usually obtain a position in society equal to that of non-disabled citizens.”&lt;ref name="Ingstad"&gt;Ingstad, B. (1997). Community-based rehabilitation in Botswana. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the formal workplace is such a social space, the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from this realm is seen by some sociologists to be a significant impediment to social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Equity in employment has been strategized by some, such as sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters, to depend on heightened awareness of current barriers, wider use of assistive technologies that can make workplaces and tasks more accessible, more accommodating job development, and most importantly deconstructing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

Creating inclusive employment that better facilitates the participation of individuals with disabilities is demonstrated to have a significantly positive impact on not only the lives of these individuals, but also the economies of nations who implement such measures. The International Labour Organization estimates that the current exclusion of employable individuals with special needs is costing countries possible gains of 1 to 7 percent of their GDP.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;International Labour Office. (2012). Employment for social justice and a fair globalization: Overview of ILO Programmes. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_140958.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The relationship between disability and poverty is seen by many to be especially problematic given that it places those with the greatest needs in a position where they have access to the fewest resources. Researchers from the [[United nations|United Nations]] and the [[Yale School of Public Health]] refer to the link between disability and poverty as a manifestation of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the assumption that this population is a drain of resources leads society to deny them access to avenues of success. Such exclusion of individuals on the basis of their special needs in turn denies them the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that disprove these stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Chamie, M., Me, A., &amp; Groce, N.E. (2000). Measuring the quality of life: Rethinking the World Bank's disability adjusted life years. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914180312/http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |archivedate=2000-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam asserts that this negative cycle is largely due to a gross underestimation of the potential held by individuals with disabilities and a lack of awareness of the possibilities that each person may hold if the proper resources were present.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

The early onset of preventable deaths has been demonstrated as a significant consequence of disability for those living in poverty. Researchers show that families who lack adequate economic agency are unable to care for children with special medical needs, resulting in preventable deaths.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; In times of economic hardship studies show families may divert resources from children with disabilities because investing in their livelihood is often perceived as an investment caretakers cannot afford to make.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, B. (1999). Promoting the rights of the disabled children globally disabled children become adults: Some implications. Frome: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicte Ingstad, an anthropologist who studied families with a member with disabilities, asserted that what some may consider neglect of individuals with disabilities “was mainly a reflection of the general hardship that the household was living under."&lt;ref name="Ingstad" /&gt; A study conducted by Oxfam found that the rejection of a child with disabilities was not uncommon in areas of [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; The report went on to show that neglect of children with disabilities was far from a deliberate choice, but rather a consequence of a lack of essential resources. The study also demonstrated that services necessary to the well being of these children “are seized upon” when they are made available. The organization thus concludes that if families had the capacity to care for children with special needs they would do so willingly, but often the inability to access crucial resources bars them from administering proper care.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

==Current initiatives==
Initiatives on the local, national, and transnational levels addressing the connection between poverty and disability are exceedingly rare. According to the UN, only 45 countries throughout the world have anti-discrimination and other disability-specific laws.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Additionally, experts point to the Western world as a demonstration that the association between poverty and disability is not naturally dissolved through the development process. Instead, a conscious effort toward inclusive development is seen by theorists, such as Disability Policy expert Mark Priestley, as essential in the remediation process.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;Priestley, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrrpeMGQCLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Disability and the life course: Global perspectives]. NY, NY: University of Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights advocate [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] asserts that it is crucial to better incorporate the voices of individuals with disabilities into the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;Charlton, J.I. (2000). Nothing about us without us: Disability oppression and empowerment. London, England: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His literature on disability rights made popular the slogan, “Nothing about us without us,” evidencing the need to ensure those most affected by policy have an equitable hand in its creation. This need for agency is an issue particularly salient for those with special needs who are often negatively stereotyped as dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt; Furthermore, many who are part of the [[disability rights movement]] argue that there is too little emphasis on aid designed to eliminate the physical and social barriers those with disabilities face. The movement asserts that unless these obstacles are rectified, the connection between disability and poverty will persist.&lt;ref name=" Philanthropy "/&gt;

Employment is seen as a critical agent in reducing stigma and increasing capacity in the lives of individuals with disabilities. The lack of opportunities currently available is shown to perpetuate the vicious cycle, causing individuals with disabilities to fall into poverty. To address these concerns many recent initiatives have begun to develop more inclusive employment structures.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; One example of this is the Ntiro Project for Supported and Inclusive Employment.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"&gt;Parmenter,T.R.(2011). Promoting training and employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. International Labour Office. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_167316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located in South Africa, the project aims to eliminate the segragationist models prevalent in the country through coordinated efforts between districts, NGOs, and community organizations. The model stresses education and pairs individuals with intellectual disabilities with mentors until they have developed the skills necessary to perform their roles independently. The program then matches individuals with local employers. This gradualist model ensures that people who may have been deprived of the resources necessary to acquire essential skills are able to build their expertise and enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"/&gt;

The United Nations has been at the forefront of initiating legislation that aims to deter the current toll disabilities take on individuals in society, especially those in poverty. In 1982 the UN published the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]], which explicitly states "Particular efforts should be made to integrate the disabled in the development process and that effective measures for prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunities are therefore essential."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=23&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine set stage for the UN Decade of the Disabled Person from 1983 to 1992, where, at its close, the General Assembly adopted the [[Standard Rules of the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Rules encourages states to remove social, cultural, economic, educational, and political barriers that bar individuals with disabilities from participating equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (2012). The convention in detail. Webaccessed: {{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612120639/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=222 |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that these movements on behalf of the UN helped facilitate more inclusive development policy and brought disability rights to the forefront.&lt;ref name="dfid_a"&gt;Yeo, R.

==Criticisms==
Critics assert that the relationship between disability and poverty may be overstated. Cultural differences in the definition of disability, bias leading to more generous estimates on behalf of researchers, and the variability in incidences that are not accounted for between countries are all speculated to be part of this mischaracterization.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; These factors lead some organizations to conclude that the projection asserting 10 percent of the global population belongs to the disabled community is entirely too broad. Speculation over the projection of a 10 percent disability rate has led other independent studies to collect varying results. The [[World Health Organization]] updated their estimate to 4 percent for developing countries and 7 percent for industrialized countries. [[USAID]] maintains the initial 10 percent figure, while the United Nations works off half of that rate with a projection of 5 percent.&lt;ref name="dfid" /&gt; The percentage of the world's population with disabilities remains a highly contested matter.

The argument that development should be channeled to better the agency of individuals with disabilities has been contested on several grounds. First, critics argue that development is enacted to harness potential that most individuals in this population do not possess.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Second, the case that health care costs for many persons with special needs are simply too great to be shouldered by the government or [[NGO]]'s has been made, especially with regard to emerging economies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that investing in an individual's rehabilitation will result in substantial change in their agency. Lastly is the proposition of priorities. It is argued that most countries in need of extensive development must focus on health ails such as infant mortality, diarrhea, and malaria that are widespread killers not limited to a specific population.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

Critique with respect to potential solutions has also been made. In regards to implementing change through policy, critics have noted that the weak legal standing of United Nations' documents and the lack of resources available to aid in their implementation have resulted in a struggle to achieve the goals set forth by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="dfid_a" /&gt; Other studies have shown that policy on a national level has not necessarily equated to marked improvements within these countries. One such example is the United States where sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters purport that “the employment of disabled individuals has increased only marginally since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.”&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; The smaller than anticipated impact of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] and other policy-based initiatives is seen as a critical flaw in legislation. This is because many issues surrounding disability, namely employment discrimination, are generally reconciled through the legal system necessitating that individuals engage in the often expensive process of litigation.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

The '''effects of high altitude on humans''' are considerable. The percentage [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|oxygen saturation]] of [[hemoglobin]] determines the content of [[oxygen]] in blood. After the [[human body]] reaches around 2,100 m (7,000 feet) above sea level, the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to decrease rapidly.&lt;ref name=BordenHuman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young|first1=Andrew J|last2=Reeves|first2=John T. |chapter=Human Adaptation to High Terrestrial Altitude|title=Medical Aspects of Harsh Environments |volume=2 |location=Borden Institute, Washington, DC |year=2002 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.3270|url=http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916195023/http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-05|archivedate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the human body has both short-term and [[high-altitude adaptation in humans|long-term adaptations]] to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen. There is a limit to the level of adaptation; mountaineers refer to the altitudes above {{convert|8000|m|ft|sigfig=2}} as the "death zone", where it is generally believed that no human body can acclimatize.&lt;ref name=Darack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grocott/&gt;&lt;ref name=nodeath/&gt;

==Effects as a function of altitude==
The human body can perform best at [[sea level]], where the [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] or 1013.25 [[bar (unit)|millibars]] (or 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], by definition). The [[Atmospheric chemistry|concentration of oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in sea-level air is 20.9%, so the [[partial pressure]] of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is 21.136 kPa. In healthy individuals, this saturates hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding red pigment in [[red blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)

|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude while the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fraction remains constant to about 100&amp;nbsp;km, so pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decreases exponentially with altitude as well. It is about half of its sea-level value at {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the altitude of the [[Everest Base Camp]], and only a third at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the summit of [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7d.html|title=Introduction to the Atmosphere|work=PhysicalGeography.net|accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; drops, the body responds with [[#Acclimatization to altitude|altitude acclimatization]].&lt;ref name=Acclimatization&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muza|first1=SR|last2=Fulco|first2=CS|last3=Cymerman|first3=A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=US Army Research Inst.

Mountain medicine recognizes three altitude regions that reflect the lowered amount of oxygen in the atmosphere:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Non-Physician Altitude Tutorial | publisher=International Society for Mountain Medicine | url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zEnyu7K2?url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm | archivedate=2011-06-06 | accessdate=22 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High altitude = {{convert|1500|-|3500|m|ft|-2}}
* Very high altitude = {{convert|3500|-|5500|m|ft|-2}}
* Extreme altitude = above {{convert|5500|m|ft|-2}}

Travel to each of these altitude regions can lead to medical problems, from the mild symptoms of [[acute mountain sickness]] to the potentially fatal [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) and [[high-altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]). The higher the altitude, the greater the risk.&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cymerman|first1=A|last2=Rock|first2=PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments.

Humans have survived for two years at {{convert|5950|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, 475 millibars of atmospheric pressure), which is the highest recorded permanently tolerable altitude; the highest permanent settlement known, [[La Rinconada, Peru|La Rinconada]], is at {{convert|5100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=highestHabitation&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=JB|pmid=12631426|title=Highest permanent human habitation|journal=High Altitude Medical Biology|volume=3|pages=401–7|year=2002|doi=10.1089/15270290260512882|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme altitudes, above {{convert|7500|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, 383 millibars of atmospheric pressure), sleeping becomes very difficult, digesting food is near-impossible, and the risk of HAPE or HACE increases greatly.&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3215854"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rose|first1=MS|last2=Houston|first2=CS|last3=Fulco|first3=CS|last4=Coates|first4=G|last5=Sutton|first5=JR|last6=Cymerman|first6=A |title=Operation Everest.

===Death zone===
[[File:Everest kalapatthar crop.jpg|thumb|The summit of [[Mount Everest]] is in the death zone.]]
The death zone, in [[mountaineering]], refers to [[altitude]]s above a certain point where the amount of [[oxygen]] is insufficient to sustain [[human]] life for an extended time span. This point is generally tagged as {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure).&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web
|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2506everest.html|title= Everest:The Death Zone|work=Nova|publisher= PBS|date= 1998-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 14 summits in the death zone above 8000 m, called [[eight-thousander]]s, are located in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakoram]] mountain ranges. The concept of the ''death zone'' (originally the ''lethal zone'') was first conceived in 1953 by [[Edouard Wyss-Dunant]], a Swiss doctor, in an article about acclimatization published in the journal of the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Mountain World |year=1953 |pages=110–117|title= Acclimatisation |last=Wyss-Dunant|first=Edouard |url=https://archive.org/details/mountainworld195029881mbp |format=PDF |accessdate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (wrong decisions made under stress, physical weakening leading to accidents).
In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and, ultimately, death.&lt;ref name=Darack&gt;{{cite book|first=Ed|last=Darack|title=Wild winds: adventures in the highest Andes|page=153|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z2WPzJHpfLEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA153&amp;dq=%22death+zone%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22death%20zone%22&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-884980-81-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huey&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/18/3115.abstract|title=Limits to human performance: elevated risks on high mountains|first=Raymond B.|last=Huey|first2=Xavier|last2=Eguskitza|date=2 July 2001|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|pages=3115–9|pmid=11581324|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grocott&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/360/2/140|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2009|volume=360|pages=140–9|title=Arterial Blood Gases and Oxygen Content in Climbers on Mount Everest|first=Michael P.W.|last=Grocott|first2=Daniel S.|last2=Martin |first3=Denny Z.H.|last3=Levett |first4=Roger|last4=McMorrow |first5=Jeremy|last5=Windsor |first6=Hugh E. |last6=Montgomery |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801581|pmid=19129527|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the High Altitude Pathology Institute in Bolivia dispute the existence of a death zone, based on observation of extreme tolerance to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] in patients with [[chronic mountain sickness]] and normal fetuses in-utero, both of which present pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels similar to those at the summit of Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=nodeath&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zubieta-Castillo|first=G.|last2=Zubieta-Calleja|first2=G.R.|last3=Zubieta-Calleja|first3=L.|last4=Zubieta-Castillo|first4=Nancy|title=Facts that Prove that Adaptation to life at Extreme Altitude (8842m) is possible|journal=Adaptation Biology and Medicine|year=2008|volume=5|issue=Suppl 5|pages=348–355 |url=http://zuniv.net/pub/Everest2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term effects===
{{Main|High-altitude adaptation in humans}}
[[File:K2 2006b.jpg|thumb|The summit of [[K2]] is in the death zone.]]
Studies have shown that the approximately 140 million people who live at elevations above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} have adapted to the lower oxygen levels. These adaptations are especially pronounced in people living in the [[Andes]] and the [[Himalaya]]s. Compared with acclimatized newcomers, native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower hemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to [[chronic mountain sickness]] (CMS). These adaptations may reflect the longer history of high altitude habitation in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=LG|last2=Niermeyer|first2=S|last3=Zamudio|first3=S|year=1998|title=Human adaptation to high altitude: Regional and life-cycle perspectives|journal=Am.

A significantly lower [[mortality rate]] from [[cardiovascular disease]] is observed for residents at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lower Mortality From Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke at Higher Altitudes in Switzerland|first1=David|last1=Faeh|first2=Felix|last2=Gutzwiller|first3=Matthias|last3=Bopp|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.819250|pmid=19635973|journal=Circulation|year=2009|volume=120|issue=6|pages=495–501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a dose response relationship exists between increasing elevation and decreasing [[obesity]] prevalence in the United States.&lt;ref name=Voss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voss|first1=JD|last2=Masuoka|first2=P|last3=Webber|first3=BJ|last4= Scher|first4=AI|last5=Atkinson|first5=RL|title=Association of Elevation, Urbanization and Ambient Temperature with Obesity Prevalence in the United States|journal=International Journal of Obesity|year=2013|pmid=23357956|doi=10.1038/ijo.2013.5|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1407–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not explained by migration alone.&lt;ref name=Voss1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voss|first1=JD|last2=Allison|first2=DB|last3=Webber|first3=BJ|last4=Otto|first4=JL|last5=Clark|first5=LL|title=Lower Obesity Rate during Residence at High Altitude among a Military Population with Frequent Migration: A Quasi Experimental Model for Investigating Spatial Causation|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=e93493 |year=2014 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093493 |pmid=24740173 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...993493V |pmc=3989193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, people living at higher elevations also have a higher rate of [[suicide]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Brenner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Barry|last2=Cheng|first2=David|last3=Clark|first3=Sunday|last4=Camargo|first4=Carlos A., Jr|title=Positive Association between Altitude and Suicide in 2584 U.S. Counties|journal=High Altitude Medicine &amp; Biology|date=Spring 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=31–5|pmid=21214344|doi=10.1089/ham.2010.1058|pmc=3114154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between elevation and suicide risk was present even when the researchers control for known suicide risk factors, including age, gender, race, and income. Research has also indicated that oxygen levels are unlikely to be a factor, considering that there is no indication of increased [[mood disturbance]]s at high altitude in those with [[sleep apnea]] or in heavy smokers at high altitude. The cause for the increased suicide risk is as yet unknown.&lt;ref name=Brenner/&gt;

==Acclimatization to altitude==
The human body can adapt to high altitude through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, in the short term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the [[carotid bodies]], which causes an increase in the breathing depth and rate ([[hyperpnea]]). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of [[respiratory alkalosis]], inhibiting the [[respiratory center]] from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.&lt;ref name=BordenHuman/&gt;&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

In addition, at high altitude, the [[Tachycardia|heart beats faster]]; the [[stroke volume]] is slightly decreased;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/116/19/2191.full|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ekN1Gllx?url=https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/116/19/2191.full|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-23|title=Effect of Altitude on the Heart and the Lungs|first1=P|last1=Bärtsch|first2=JSR|last2=Gibbs|journal=Circulation|year=2007|volume=116|issue=19|pages=2191–2202|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.650796|pmid=17984389}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, resulting in a decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the [[digestive system]] in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Westerterp | first =Klaas | authorlink = | title =Energy and Water Balance at High Altitude | journal =News in Physiological Sciences | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =134–7 | pmid =11443234 | url =http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/16/3/134.full | accessdate = | quote = | date = June 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full acclimatization, however, requires days or even weeks. Gradually, the body compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days at any given altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as [[acetazolamide]].&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/768478-overview|work=eMedicine Specialties &gt; Emergency Medicine &gt; Environmental|title=Altitude Illness – Cerebral Syndromes|first1=N Stuart|last1=Harris|first2=Sara W|last2=Nelson|date=16 Apr 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower [[lactic acid|lactate]] production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased [[Blood plasma|plasma]] volume, increased [[hematocrit]] ([[polycythemia]]), increased [[Red blood cell|RBC]] mass, a higher concentration of [[capillaries]] in [[skeletal muscle]] tissue, increased [[myoglobin]], increased [[mitochondria]], increased [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] enzyme concentration, increase in [[2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-BPG]], [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]], and [[right ventricular hypertrophy]].&lt;ref name=BordenHuman/&gt; Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood.

Full hematological adaptation to high altitude is achieved when the increase of red blood cells reaches a plateau and stops. The length of full hematological adaptation can be approximated by multiplying the altitude in kilometres by 11.4 days. For example, to adapt to {{convert|4000|m|ft}} of altitude would require 45.6 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zubieta-Calleja|first=G.

Even when acclimatized, prolonged exposure to high altitude can interfere with [[pregnancy]] and cause [[intrauterine growth restriction]] or [[pre-eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Placenta|date=April 2004|volume=25|pages=S60–S71|title=Maternal Adaptation to High-altitude Pregnancy: An Experiment of Nature—A Review|first1=LG|last1=Moore|first2=M|last2=Shriver|first3=L|last3=Bemis|first4=B|last4=Hickler|first5=M|last5=Wilson|first6=T|last6=Brutsaert|first7=E|last7=Parra|first8=E|last8=Vargas|display-authors=4|doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2004.01.008|url=https://www.placentajournal.org/article/S0143-4004(04)00022-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; High altitude causes decreased blood flow to the [[placenta]], even in acclimatized women, which interferes with fetal growth.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Altitude and athletic performance==
{{Main|Altitude training}}
[[File:Swiss Olympic training base.jpg|thumb|right|Athletes training at high altitude in [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] (elevation 1,856 m or 6,089 ft).]]
For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete's performance will generally be better at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=16|pages=655–8|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1|pmid=6643537|first1=AJ|issue=8|bibcode=1976JBiom...9..481R}}&lt;/ref&gt; For endurance events (races of 800 metres or more), the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen, which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletics Federations ([[IAAF]]), for example, have ruled that performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres will be approved for record purposes, but carry the notation of "A" to denote they were set at altitude.  [[1968 in athletics#Altitude|The 1968 Summer Olympics]] were held at altitude in [[Mexico City]].  With the best athletes in the world competing for the most prestigious title, most short sprint and jump records were set there at altitude.  Other records were also set at altitude in anticipation of those Olympics.  [[Bob Beamon]]'s record in the [[long jump]] held for almost 23 years and has only been beaten once without altitude or [[wind assistance#Long jump|wind assistance]].  Many of the other records set at Mexico City were later surpassed by marks set at altitude.

Athletes can also take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance.&lt;ref name=Acclimatization/&gt; The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. However, this may not always be the case. Any positive acclimatization effects may be negated by a de-training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level.

This conundrum led to the development of the altitude training modality known as "Live-High, Train-Low", whereby the athlete spends many hours a day resting and sleeping at one (high) altitude, but performs a significant portion of their training, possibly all of it, at another (lower) altitude. A series of studies conducted in Utah in the late 1990s by researchers Ben Levine, Jim Stray-Gundersen, and others, showed significant performance gains in athletes who followed such a protocol for several weeks.&lt;ref name="pmid9216951"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Levine|first1=BD|last2=Stray-Gundersen|first2=J |title="Living high-training low": effect of moderate-altitude acclimatization with low-altitude training on performance |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=102–12 |date=July 1997|pmid=9216951 |doi= 10.1152/jappl.1997.83.1.102|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/83/1/102.long |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11509506"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stray-Gundersen |first1=J|last2=Chapman|first2=RF|last3=Levine|first3=BD |title="Living high-training low" altitude training improves sea level performance in male and female elite runners |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=1113–20 |date=September 2001|pmid=11509506 |doi= 10.1152/jappl.2001.91.3.1113|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/91/3/1113.long |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown performance gains from merely performing some exercising sessions at high altitude, yet living at sea level.&lt;ref name="pmid16540709"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dufour|first=SP|last2=Ponsot|first2=E.|last3=Zoll|first3=J.|last4=Doutreleau|first4=S.|last5=Lonsdorfer-Wolf|first5=E.|last6=Geny|first6=B.|last7=Lampert|first7=E.|last8=Flück|first8=M.|last9=Hoppeler|first9=H.|last10=Billat|first10=V.|last11=Mettauer|first11=B.|last12=Richard|first12=R.|last13=Lonsdorfer|first13=J. |title=Exercise training in normobaric hypoxia in endurance runners.

'''Endurance''' (also related to [[wikt:sufferance|sufferance]], [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], [[wikt:constitution|constitution]], [[wikt:fortitude|fortitude]], and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]) is the ability of an [[organism]] to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from, and have immunity to [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], wounds, or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. It is usually used in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise]]. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce the ability to exert endurance [[physical strength|strength]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Hickson |first =  RC | year = 1980 |title = Interference of strength development by simultaneously training for strength and endurance over a long period |journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology |publisher = Springer Verlag |volume = 45 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 255–63 |doi = 10.1007/BF00421333 |pmid = 7193134}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 2007-05-07 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; unless an individual also undertakes [[Strength training|resistance training]] to counteract this effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10059">'''Environment, health and safety''' ('''EHS''') is a discipline and specialty that studies and implements practical aspects of environmental protection and safety at work. In simple terms it is what organizations must do to make sure that their activities do not cause harm to anyone.

Regulatory requirements play an important role in EHS discipline and EHS managers must identify and understand relevant EHS regulations, the implications of which must be communicated to executive management  so the company can implement suitable measures. Organisations based in the United States are subject to EHS regulations in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], particularly CFR 29, 40, and 49. Still, EHS management is not limited to legal compliance and companies should be encouraged to do more than is required by law, if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Kavianian, Hamid R. "Occupational and Environmental Safety Engineering and Management", Van Norstrand Reinhold Company, New York (1990), {{ISBN|0-442-23822-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a '''health &amp; safety''' standpoint, it involves creating organized efforts and procedures for identifying workplace hazards and reducing accidents and exposure to harmful situations and substances. It also includes training of personnel in accident prevention, accident response, emergency preparedness, and use of protective clothing and equipment.

From an '''environmental''' standpoint, it involves creating a systematic approach to complying with environmental regulations, such as managing waste or air emissions all the way to helping site's reduce the company's carbon footprint.

Successful HSE programs also include measures to address ergonomics, [[air pollution|air quality]], and other aspects of workplace safety that could affect the health and well-being of employees and the overall community.

==History==

The [[chemical industry]] introduced the first formal [https://www.gensuite.com/ EHS management] approach in 1985 as a reaction to several catastrophic accidents (like the [[Seveso disaster]] of July 1976 and the [[Bhopal disaster]] of December 1984). This worldwide voluntary initiative, called "[[Responsible Care]]", started by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (formerly the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association - CCPA), operates in about 50 countries, with central coordination provided by the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA). It involves eight fundamental features which ensure plant and product safety, occupational health and environmental protection, but which also try to demonstrate by [[image-building]] campaigns that the chemical industry acts in a responsible manner. Being an initiative of the ICCA, it is restricted to the chemical industry.

Since the 1990s, general approaches to EHS management that may fit any type of organisation have appeared in international standards such as:

* the [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme]] (EMAS), developed by the [[European Commission]] in 1993
* [[ISO 14001]] for environmental management in 1996
* [[ISO 45001]] for occupational health and safety management in 2018, preceded by [[OHSAS 18001]] 1999

In 1998 the [[International Finance Corporation]] established EHS guidelines.

'''Evidence-based medicine''' ('''EBM''') is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize [[decision-making]] by emphasizing the use of [[evidence]] from well-designed and well-conducted [[research]]. Although all medicine based on [[science]] has some degree of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its [[epistemology|epistemologic]] strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], [[systematic review]]s, and [[randomized controlled trial]]s) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.&lt;ref name="Guyatt"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence-based medicine. A new approach to teaching the practice of medicine |journal=JAMA |volume=268 |issue=17 |pages=2420–25 |date=November 1992 |pmid=1404801 |doi= 10.1001/jama.268.17.2420 |author1= Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/9675/jama_268_17_032.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations ("evidence-based practice policies").&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies – Where Do They Come from?|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1990|volume=263|issue=9|pages=1265, 1269, 1272, 1275|doi=10.1001/jama.263.9.1265 |pmid=2304243 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=1265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decision-making that is used at virtually every level of [[health care]] as well as other fields ([[evidence-based practice]]).

Whether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to assure that a [[clinician]]'s opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the [[scientific literature]] so that [[best practice]] can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.

==Background, history and definition==
In its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making. Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=447–50 See p. 449|date=May 2000 |pmid=10824622 |doi=10.1067/mcp.2000.106465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11058989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly WJ, Brater DC |title=Medieval contributions to the search for truth in clinical medicine |journal=Perspect. Biol. Med. |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=530–40 See p. 536  |year=2000 |pmid=11058989 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2000.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently to [[protestant]] [[reformation]] [[exegetical|exegesis]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gerber2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gerber A|author2=Lungen M|author3=Lauterbach KW |title=Evidence-based medicine is rooted in Protestant exegesis | year=2005  | publisher = Medical Hypotheses, Penrith, Eng., Eden Press | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 1034–38 | pmid = 15780507 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was published in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poisson, Dulong |author2=Larrey, Double |title=Statistical research on conditions caused by calculi by Doctor Civiale. |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1246–49 |year=2001 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.6.1246 |url=http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |origyear=1835 |pmid=11821317 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050429042527/http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |archivedate=2005-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, until recently, the process by which research results were incorporated in medical decisions was highly subjective.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Called "clinical judgment" and "the art of medicine", the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence, if any, to consider, and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the case of decisions which applied to groups of patients or populations, the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts, but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} There was an [[implicit assumption]] that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately, based on their education, experience, and ongoing study of the applicable literature.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Clinical decision making===
Beginning in the late 1960s, several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decision-making. [[Alvan Feinstein]]'s publication of ''Clinical Judgment'' in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it.&lt;ref name="feinstein"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvan R. Feinstein|title=Clinical Judgement|date=1967|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Archie Cochrane]] published ''Effectiveness and Efficiency'', which described the lack of controlled trials supporting many practices that had previously been assumed to be effective.&lt;ref name="cochraneal"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cochrane A.L.| authorlink= Archie Cochrane | title=Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services|date=1972|publisher=Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[John Wennberg]] began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced.&lt;ref name="wennberg"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Wennberg J.E. |author2=Gittelsohn A. |title=Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery|journal=Science|volume=182|issue=4117|pages=1102–08|doi=10.1126/science.182.4117.1102 |year=1973 |pmid=4750608 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4750608|bibcode=1973Sci...182.1102W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1980s, [[David M. Eddy]] described errors in clinical reasoning and gaps in evidence.&lt;ref name="eddy2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=David M. |chapter=18 Probabilistic Reasoning in Clinical Medicine: Problems and Opportunities |editor-first=D. |editor-last=Kahneman |editor2-first=P. |editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=A. |editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;pg=PA249 |date=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-28414-1 |pages=249–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddy3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Clinical Policies and the Quality of Clinical Practice|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1982|volume=307 |issue=6 |pages=343–47 |pmid=7088099 |doi=10.1056/nejm198208053070604 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM198208053070604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddy4"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Eddy DM|title=Variations in Physician Practice The Role of Uncertainty|journal=Health Affairs|volume=3 |issue=2 |date=1984|pages=74–89|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.3.2.74 |pmid=6469198 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6469198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddy5"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy DM |title=The Quality of Medical Evidence: Implications for Quality of Care |journal=Health Affairs |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=1988 |pages=19–32 |pmid=3360391 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.7.1.19 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3360391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1980s, Alvin Feinstein, [[David Sackett]] and others published textbooks on clinical [[epidemiology]], which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision making.&lt;ref name="feinstein2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Feinstein AR|title=Clinical Epidemiology: The Architecture of Clinical Research|date=1985|isbn=9780721613086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sackett"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sackett |first=Dave |editor-first=R.

&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the 1980s, a group at [[RAND]] showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts.&lt;ref name="chassin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chassin MR, Kosecoff J, Solomon DH, Brook RH |title=How Coronary Angiography Is Used: Clinical Determinants of Appropriateness|journal=JAMA|volume=258|issue=18|date=1987|pages=2543–47|doi=10.1001/jama.258.18.2543 |pmid=3312657 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=258&amp;page=2543}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas of research increased awareness of the weaknesses in medical decision making at the level of both individual patients and populations, and paved the way for the introduction of evidence-based methods.

===Evidence-based===
The term "evidence-based medicine", as it is currently used, has two main tributaries. Chronologically, the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other population-level policies. The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patient-level decision-making.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Evidence-based guidelines and policies===
The term "evidence-based" was first used by David M. Eddy in the course of his work on population-level policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies. He first began to use the term "evidence-based" in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine.&lt;ref name="eddy1992"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=A Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Policies |publisher=American College of Physicians|date=1992 |isbn=0943126185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="field"&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Advise the Public Health Service on Clinical Practice Guidelines, Institute of Medicine |editor-last=Field |editor-first=M.J. |editor2-last=Lohr |editor2-first=K.N.  |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Directions for a New Program |publisher=National Academy of Sciences Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-309-07666-1 |page=32 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1626&amp;page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy first published the term "evidence-based" in March, 1990 in an article in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as "explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence. Consciously anchoring a policy, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence. The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written."&lt;ref name="eddy6"/&gt; He discussed "evidence-based" policies in several other papers published in ''JAMA'' in the spring of 1990.&lt;ref name="eddy6"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies: Guidelines for Methods|journal=JAMA |volume=263 |issue=13 |date=1990|pages=1839–41|doi=10.1001/jama.263.13.1839 |pmid=2313855 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddy7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Guidelines for Policy Statements|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=263 |issue=16 |date=1990 |pages=2239–43 |doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440160101046 |pmid=2319689 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=2239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those papers were part of a series of 28 published in ''JAMA'' between 1990 and 1997 on formal methods for designing population-level guidelines and policies.&lt;ref name="eddy8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=Clinical Decision Making: From Theory to Practice. A Collection of Essays|publisher=American Medical Association|date=1996 |isbn=0763701432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical education===
The term "evidence-based medicine" was introduced slightly later, in the context of medical education. This branch of evidence-based medicine has its roots in clinical epidemiology. In the autumn of 1990, [[Gordon Guyatt]] used it in an unpublished description of a program at [[McMaster University]] for prospective or new medical students.&lt;ref name="howick"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeremy H. |last=Howick|title=The Philosophy of Evidence-based Medicine|publisher=Wiley |page=15|isbn= 978-1-4443-4266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guyatt and others first published the term two years later (1992) to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine.&lt;ref name="Guyatt"/&gt;

In 1996, David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research."&lt;ref name="sackett2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sackett DL, Rosenberg WM, Gray JA, Haynes RB, Richardson WS |date=1996|title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't| journal=BMJ| volume=312| issue=7023| pages=71–72| doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71| pmid=8555924|pmc=2349778}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of evidence-based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite book| last = Katz| first = David L.| title = Clinical Epidemiology &amp; Evidence-Based Medicine: Fundamental Principles of Clinical Reasoning &amp; Research| year = 2001| publisher = SAGE| isbn = 978-0-7619-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grobbee"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Grobbee| first1 = D.E.| last2 = Hoes| first2 = Arno W.| title = Clinical Epidemiology: Principles, Methods, and Applications for Clinical Research| year = 2009| publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| isbn = 978-0-7637-5315-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population-based data are applied to the care of an individual patient,&lt;ref name="doi"&gt;{{cite book| last = Doi| first = S.A.R.| title = Understanding evidence in health care: Using clinical epidemiology| year = 2012| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| location = South Yarra, VIC, Australia| isbn = 978-1-4202-5669-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;

This tributary of evidence-based medicine had its foundations in [[clinical epidemiology]], a discipline that teaches health care workers how to apply clinical and epidemiological research studies to their practices. Between 1993 and 2000, the Evidence-based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 "Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature" in ''JAMA''. In 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined individual level evidence-based medicine as "the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions."&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenberg W, Donald A |title=Evidence-based Medicine: An approach to Clinical Problem Solving| journal=BMJ| volume=310|issue=6987| pages=1122–26|doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6987.1122 |year=1995 |pmid=7742682 |pmc=2549505 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7742682}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: "the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients."&lt;ref name="greenhalgh1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|date=2010|title=How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence-Based Medicine (4th ed.)|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|page= 1|isbn=978-1-4443-9036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidence-based medicine, but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;

The two original definitions{{which|date=June 2017}} highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals. When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings where there is relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians, evidence-based policymaking stresses that there should be good evidence to document a test´s or treatment´s effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Eddy1990"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies – Where Do They Come from?|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1990|volume=263|issue=9|pages=1265, 1269, 1272, 1275|doi=10.1001/jama.263.9.1265|pmid=2304243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the setting of individual decision-making, practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="greenhalgh2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|title=The limits of evidence-based medicine|journal= Respiratory care|volume=46|issue=12|pages=1435–40|pmid=11728302|date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM: "Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit."&lt;ref name="eddybmapproach"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Eddy, DM|title=Evidence-based Medicine: a Unified Approach|journal=Health Affairs |date=2005|issue=1 |volume=24 |pages=9–17 |pmid=15647211 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15647211 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progress===
Both branches of evidence-based medicine spread rapidly. On the evidence-based guidelines and policies side, explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy D |title=ACS report on the cancer-related health checkup |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=193–240 |year=1980 |pmid=6774802|doi=10.3322/canjclin.30.4.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence-based principles in 1984.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/about.htm|title=About the USPSTF|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence-based criteria for covering new technologies.&lt;ref name="rettig"&gt;{{cite book |first=R.A. |last=Rettig |first2=P.D. |last2=Jacobson |first3=C.M. |last3=Farquhar |first4=W.M. |last4=Aubry |title=False Hope : Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbcTZLRRVmoC&amp;pg=PA183 |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-974824-2 |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians, and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association, wrote many evidence-based guidelines. In 1991, Kaiser Permanente, a managed care organization in the US, began an evidence-based guidelines program.&lt;ref name="kaiserpermanente"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davino-Ramaya C, Krause LK, Robbins CW, Harris JS, Koster M, Chan W, Tom GI |title=Transparency matters: Kaiser Permanente's National Guideline Program methodological processes |journal=Perm J |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=55–62 |year=2012 |pmid=22529761 |pmc=3327114 |doi=10.7812/tpp/11-134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the ''British Medical Journal'' and introduced the ideas of evidence-based policies in the UK.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith RJ|title=Where's the Wisdom: The Poverty of Medical Evidence|journal=BMJ|volume=303 |issue=6806 |pages=798–99 |year=1991 |pmid=1932964 |pmc=1671173 |doi=10.1136/bmj.303.6806.798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of 13 countries to produce of systematic reviews and guidelines.&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) established Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines.&lt;ref name="ahrq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/overview/index.html|title=Agency for Health Care Policy and Research|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidence-based policies was created by AHRQ, the AMA, and the American Association of Health Plans (now America's Health Insurance Plans).&lt;ref name="guideline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideline.gov|title=National Guideline Clearinghouse|accessdate=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819030216/http://www.guideline.gov/|archive-date=August 19, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was created in the UK.&lt;ref name="nice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk|title=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central idea of this branch of evidence-based medicine is that evidence should be classified according to the rigor of its experimental design, and the strength of a recommendation should depend on the strength of the evidence.

On the medical education side, programs to teach evidence-based medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilic|first1=D|last2=Maloney|first2=S|title=Methods of teaching medical trainees evidence-based medicine: a systematic review.|journal=Medical education|date=February 2014|volume=48|issue=2|pages=124–35|doi=10.1111/medu.12288|pmid=24528395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maggio|first1=LA|last2=Tannery|first2=NH|last3=Chen|first3=HC|last4=ten Cate|first4=O|last5=O'Brien|first5=B|title=Evidence-based medicine training in undergraduate medical education: a review and critique of the literature published 2006-2011.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=July 2013|volume=88|issue=7|pages=1022–8|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182951959|pmid=23702528}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although there was considerable variation in the methods and content, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials.&lt;ref name="medteach"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meats E1, Heneghan C, Crilly M, Glasziou P|title=Evidence-based medicine teaching in UK medical schools|journal=Med Teach|date=April 2009|volume=31|issue=4|pages=332–37|doi=10.1080/01421590802572791 |pmid=19404893 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01421590802572791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence. For example, UpToDate was created in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="uptodate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/home|title=UpToDate|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing evidence reviews in 1993.&lt;ref name=kaiserpermanente /&gt; BMJ Publishing Group launched a 6-monthly periodical in 1995 called Clinical Evidence that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians.&lt;ref name="clinicalevidence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalevidence.bmj.com|title=Clinical Evidence|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many other programs have been developed to make evidence more accessible to practitioners.

===Current practice===
The term evidence-based medicine is now applied to both the programs that are designing evidence-based guidelines and the programs that teach evidence-based medicine to practitioners. By 2000, "evidence-based medicine" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term "evidence-based" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is "evidence-based health services", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, J. A. Muir|date=2009|title=Evidence-based Health Care &amp; Public Health|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443101236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also spread outside of healthcare; for example, in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith proposed that "[[evidence-based policy]]" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work.

The multiple tributaries of evidence-based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.&lt;ref name=eddy5 /&gt; The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.&lt;ref name=feinstein2 /&gt; Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.&lt;ref name=sackett /&gt;

==Methods==

===Steps===
The steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in "evidence tables"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a "balance sheet"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.&lt;ref name=eddy4/&gt;

For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis. Journal Club of the Hamilton Regional Critical Care Group |journal=J Intensive Care Med |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=275–82 |year=1992 |pmid=10147956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the experience of delegates attending the 2003 Conference of Evidence-Based Health Care Teachers and Developers was summarized into five steps and published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dawes M, Summerskill W, Glasziou P, etal |title=Sicily statement on evidence-based practice |journal=BMC Med Educ |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=1 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15634359 |pmc=544887 |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-5-1 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/5/1}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five step process can broadly be categorized as:

===Evidence reviews===
Systematic reviews of published research studies is a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] is one of the best-known programs that conducts systematic reviews. Like other collections of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed and repeatable plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence.&lt;ref name="Tanjong2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanjong-Ghogomu|first=E|author2=Tugwell, P|author3=Welch, V|title=Evidence-based medicine and the Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Bulletin of the NYU hospital for joint diseases|year=2009|volume=67|issue=2|pages=198–205|pmid=19583554|url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601140339/http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f|archivedate=2013-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as (1) likely to be beneficial, (2) likely to be harmful, or (3) evidence did not support either benefit or harm.

A 2007 analysis of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial, 7% concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful, and 49% concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research.&lt;ref name="Mapping2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El Dib RP, Atallah AN, Andriolo RB |title=Mapping the Cochrane evidence for decision making in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=689–92 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17683315 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2007.00886.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews (excluding complementary treatments) in the 1998 database revealed that, according to two readers, 41% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, 8% concluded net harmful effects, and 21% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="Ezzo2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezzo J, Bausell B, Moerman DE, Berman B, Hadhazy V | title= Reviewing the reviews.

===Assessing the quality of evidence===
{{Main|Levels of evidence}}
Evidence quality can be assessed based on the source type (from [[meta-analyses]] and [[systematic reviews]] of [[triple-blind]] randomized [[clinical trials]] with concealment of allocation and no attrition at the top end, down to [[conventional wisdom]] at the bottom), as well as other factors including statistical validity, clinical relevance, currency, and peer-review acceptance. Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=grade |title=EBM: Levels of Evidence |publisher=Essential Evidence Plus |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], triple-blind, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion "does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence" and continue that "expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone").&lt;ref name="Tonelli99"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.

Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following:&lt;ref name="USPrevServTaskForce"&gt;{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&amp;pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].
* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].
* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] or [[case-control]] studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple [[time series]] designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.
* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

Another example is the [[Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence|Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence]]. First released in September 2000, the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence provides 'levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels was Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group|title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2’|url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=C.|author2=Gallini A|author3=Archier E|title=Evidence-Based Recommendations on Topical Treatment and Phototherapy of Psoriasis: Systematic Review and Expert Opinion of a Panel of Dermatologists|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology|year=2012|volume=26 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=1–10|pmid=22512675 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a system was developed by the [[GRADE]] (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.&lt;ref name="GRADE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |title=GRADE working group |accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5EyFnGxmY?url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |archivedate=2006-04-07 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires users of GRADE  who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect (a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.&lt;ref name="balshem2011"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Balshem H, Helfand M, [[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] HJ, etal |title=GRADE guidelines: 3. Rating the quality of evidence |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=401–6 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21208779 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.07.015 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(10)00332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRADE working group defines 'quality of evidence' and 'strength of recommendations' based on the quality as two different concepts which are commonly confused with each other.&lt;ref name=balshem2011/&gt;

Systematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or, observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high, but can be downgraded in five different domains.&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|url=http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|edition=Version 3.2|veditors=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] H, Brożek J, Oxman A|access-date=2016-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305115426/http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Risk of bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect.
* Imprecision: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.
* Indirectness: Is a judgement made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.
* Inconsistency: Is a judgement made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.
* Publication bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.

In the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"/&gt;

* Large effect: This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.
* Plausible confounding would change the effect: This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.
* Dose response gradient: This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.

Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:&lt;ref name="balshem2011"/&gt;
* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as "there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions."
* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.
* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as "further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely."
* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as "new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely."

===Categories of recommendations===
In guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M|author2=Burak K|author3=Maroun J|title=Multidisciplinary Canadian Consensus Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma’|journal=Current Oncology|year=2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=228–40|pmc=3185900|doi=10.3747/co.v18i5.952|pmid=21980250|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.
* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.
* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.

GRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"/&gt;

Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.

===Statistical measures===
Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:

*Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.
*AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.
*[[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1339 women age 50–59 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,&lt;ref name="BandolierStatins2004"&gt;"Patient Compliance with statins" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.

===Quality of clinical trials===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.

*Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.
*Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.
*Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.
*Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.

==Limitations and criticism==
Although evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use.&lt;ref name="Timmermans2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister ("limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine")&lt;ref name="Straus-McAlister-2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Straus|first1=SE|last2=McAlister|first2=FA|title=Evidence-based medicine: a commentary on common criticisms|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=3 October 2000|volume=163|issue=7|pages=837–41|pmid=11033714|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/7/837.full.pdf|pmc=80509}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).&lt;ref name="Cohen-2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AM|last2=Stavri|first2=PZ|last3=Hersh|first3=WR|title=A categorization and analysis of the criticisms of Evidence-Based Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=February 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=35–43|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.002|pmid=15036077|url=http://skynet.ohsu.edu/~hersh/ijmi-04-ebm.pdf|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In no particular order, some published objections include:

* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.
* Research produced by EBM, such as from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations.&lt;ref name="pmid11489034"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Upshur RE, VanDenKerkhof EG, Goel V |title=Meaning and measurement: an inclusive model of evidence in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=91–96 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11489034 |issn=1356-1294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2753.2001.00279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms. Since certain population segments have been historically under-researched (racial minorities and people with co-morbid diseases), evidence from RCTs may not be generalizable to those populations.&lt;ref name = "orvyhi"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rogers WA |title=Evidence based medicine and justice: a framework for looking at the impact of EBM upon vulnerable or disadvantaged groups |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–45 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15082806 |pmc=1733835 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.007062 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/2/141.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus EBM applies to groups of people, but this should not preclude clinicians from using their personal experience in deciding how to treat each patient. One author advises that "the knowledge gained from clinical research does not directly answer the primary clinical question of what is best for the patient at hand" and suggests that evidence-based medicine should not discount the value of clinical experience.&lt;ref name="Tonelli99" /&gt; Another author stated that "the practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research."&lt;ref name="Sackett96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=DL | last2=Rosenberg |first2=WM |last3=Gray |first3=JA |last4=Haynes |first4=RB |last5=Richardson |first5=WS |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7023 |pages=71–72 |date=January 1996 |pmid=8555924 |pmc=2349778  |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Research can be influenced by biases such as [[publication bias]] and [[conflict of interest]]. For example, studies with conflicts due to industry funding are more likely to favor their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Every-Palmer S, Howick J |title= How evidence‐based medicine is failing due to biased trials and selective publication |journal=Journal of evaluation in clinical practice |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=908–14 |date=May 2014 |doi=10.1111/jep.12147|pmid= 24819404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30617.x |vauthors=Friedman LS, Richter ED |title=Relationship Between Conflicts of Interest and Research Results |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=51–56 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14748860 |pmc=1494677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hypocognition]] (the absence of a simple, consolidated mental framework that new information can be placed into) can hinder the application of EBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mariotto | first1 = A. | title = Hypocognition and evidence-based medicine | doi = 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02086.x | journal = Internal Medicine Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–82 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20561370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of evidence in clinical settings ==
One of the ongoing challenges with evidence-based medicine is that some healthcare providers do not follow the evidence.  This happens partly because the current balance of evidence for and against treatments shifts constantly, and it is impossible to learn about every change.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes|title=When Evidence Says No, But Doctors Say Yes|last=Epstein|first=David|date=2017-02-22|newspaper=ProPublica|access-date=2017-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when the evidence is unequivocally against a treatment, it usually takes ten years for other treatments to be adopted.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;  In other cases, significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die, and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;

Another major cause of physicians and other healthcare providers treating patients in ways unsupported by the evidence is that these healthcare providers are subject to the same cognitive biases as all other humans.  They may reject the evidence because they have a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome (the [[availability heuristic]]), such as a patient dying after refusing treatment.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;  They may overtreat to "do something" or to address a patient's emotional needs.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;  They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;  They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;

A Campbell systematic review that included 24 trials examined the effectiveness of e-learning in improving evidence-based health care knowledge and practice. It was found that e-learning, compared to no learning, improves evidence-based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour. There is no difference in outcomes when comparing e-learning to face-to-face learning. Combining e-learning with face-to-face learning (blended learning) has a positive impact on evidence-based knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rohwer, Anke; Motaze, Nkengafac Villyen; Rehfuess, Eva; Young, Taryn|title=E-learning of evidence-based health care (EBHC) to increase EBHC competencies in healthcare professionals: a systematic review|journal=Campbell Systematic Reviews|date=2017|volume=4|doi=10.4073/csr.2017.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to e-learning, medical school students have engaged with editing Wikipedia to increase their EBM skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azzam|first1=A|last2=Bresler|first2=D|last3=Leon|first3=A|last4=Maggio|first4=L|last5=Whitaker|first5=E|last6=Heilman|first6=J|last7=Orlowitz|first7=J|last8=Swisher|first8=V|last9=Rasberry|first9=L|last10=Otoide|first10=K|last11=Trotter|first11=F|last12=Ross|first12=W|last13=McCue|first13=JD|title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=February 2017|volume=92|issue=2|pages=194–200|doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381|pmid=27627633|pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fathers' rights movement''' is a movement whose members are primarily interested in issues related to [[family law]], including [[child custody]] and [[child support]] that affect fathers and their [[child]]ren.&lt;ref name=Collier2006&gt;[[#FRALR|Collier &amp; Sheldon]], 2006, p. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collier&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collier |first1=R. |last2=Sheldon |first2=S. |title=Unfamiliar territory: The issue of a father's rights and responsibilities covers more than just the media-highlighted subject of access to his children |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-11-01 |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1935970,00.html |accessdate=2007-10-17 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520124643/http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0%2C%2C1935970%2C00.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its members are fathers who desire to share the parenting of their children equally with their children's mothers—either after [[divorce]] or as unwed fathers—and the children of the terminated marriage. The movement includes men as well as women, often the second wives of divorced fathers or other family members of men who have had some engagement with [[family law]].&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaye&gt;{{cite journal | last =Kaye | first =Miranda |last2=Tolmie |first2=Julia | title =Fathers' Rights Groups in Australia and their Engagement with Issues in Family Law | journal =Australian Journal of Family Law | volume =12 | pages = 19–68 | year =1998 | url =http://sisyphe.org/IMG/doc/doc-656.doc |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format=Doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crowley"/&gt;

Most of its members had little prior interest in the law or politics. However, as they felt that their goal of equal-shared parenting was being frustrated by the family courts, many took an interest in family law, including child custody and child support.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Many Women in Civil Rights Movement"/&gt;

The movement has received international press coverage as a result of high-profile activism of their members.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt; It has become increasingly vocal, visible and organised, and has played a powerful role in family law debates.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;

The fathers' rights movement has both liberal and conservative branches, with different viewpoints about how men and women compare. Although both groups agree on the victimization and discrimination against men, they disagree on why men and women differ ([[nature versus nurture]]) and traditional [[gender role]]s. The liberal version believes the differences between the sexes are due to culture and supports equality between men and women; in contrast, the conservative branch believes in traditional [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]/[[Complementarianism|complementary]] families and that the differences [[Gender differences|between genders are due to biology]].&lt;ref name="williams2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first =GI | title = Historical and Multicultural Encyclopedia of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | year = 2002| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKVzULJ–764C&amp;pg=PA81 81–83] | chapter = Fathers' Rights Movement|isbn=978-0-313-30644-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gavanas04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = GI |last2=Williams |first2=RH | title = Social Problems: Constructionist Readings | editor-last = Loseke |editor-first=DR |editor-last2=Best |editor-first2=J | publisher = Aldine Transaction | year = 2003 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXIspcMwljIC&amp;pg=PA93 93–100] | chapter = Framing in the Fathers' Rights Movement | isbn = 978-0-202-30703-9 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Parke and Armin Brott view the fathers' rights movement as one of three strands within the [[men's movement]] that deal almost exclusively with fatherhood, the other two being the good fathers' movement and groups forming the Christian Men's movement – the [[Promise Keepers]] being the largest.&lt;ref name=Parke1999&gt;[[#Parke1999|Parke]], 1999, p.

[[Warren Farrell]], a veteran of the women's, men's and fathers' movement since the 1970s, describes the fathers' rights movement as part of a larger "gender transition movement" and thinks that, similar to women in the 1960s, fathers are transitioning from gender-based to more flexible family roles. Farrell also believes the movement helps children by increasing the number who are raised equally by both parents, which in turn increases the children's social, academic, psychological, and physical benefits—in his opinion it becomes a [[children's rights]] issue with fathers acting as advocates.&lt;ref name=Farrell2001/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}

Fathers' rights groups also provide emotional and practical support for members during separation and divorce.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;

Some fathers' rights groups have become frustrated with the slow pace of traditional campaigning for law reform; groups such as the originally UK-based ''[[Fathers 4 Justice]]'' have become increasingly vocal and visible, undertaking public demonstrations that have attracted public attention and influenced the politics of family justice.&lt;ref name=fralr3/&gt; Following protests, some fathers' rights activists have been convicted of offenses such as harassment and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Stating that "children need two parents" and that "children have a fundamental human right to an opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce.&lt;ref name="The first article"&gt;{{cite news | last = Parkin | first = K | date = 1974-06-12 | title = Fathers need their families | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = http://www.fnf.org.uk/about-us/the-first-article | accessdate = 2008-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shared Parenting Council"&gt;{{cite web | title = Shared Parenting Council | publisher = Shared Parenting Council | url = http://www.familylawwebguide.com.au/spca/index.php?page= | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081004094739/http://www.familylawwebguide.com.au/spca/index.php?page= | archivedate = 4 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They call for laws creating a [[rebuttable presumption]] of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it.&lt;ref name="Ottaman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ottman | first = Ana |last2=Lee |first2=Rebekah | title = Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence | editor-last=Edleson |editor-first=Jeffrey L. |editor-last2=Renzetti |editor-first2=Claire M. | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2008 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA252 252] | chapter = Fathers' rights movement | isbn = 978-1-4129-1800-8 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide,&lt;ref name="Politics of Fatherhood - S.

Members of the fathers' rights movement and their critics disagree about the correlation of negative developmental outcomes for children to sole custody situations. Social scientist V. C. McLoyd states that father absence covaries with other relevant family characteristics such as the lack of an income from a male adult, the absence of a second adult, and the lack of support from a second extended family system and conclude that it is the negative effects of poverty, and not the absence of a father, that result in negative developmental outcomes.&lt;ref name="Father Absent Homes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McLoyd |first=VC | title = Socioeconomic disadvantage and child development | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–204 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9491747 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/53/2/185}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Professor Craig Hart states that although the consequences of poverty and having a single parent are interrelated, each is a risk factor with independent effects on children,&lt;ref name="Shared Parenting Research"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hart | first = CH | title = Combating the Myth that Parents Don't Matter | publisher = The Howard Center for Family Religion and Society | year = 1999 | url = http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211235613/http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | archivedate = 11 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silverstein and Auerbach state that the negative outcomes for children in sole custody situations correlate more strongly to "fatherlessness" than to any other variable including poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deconstructing the Essential Father | publisher = SPARC | url = http://www.deltabravo.net/custody/deconstruct.php | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"/&gt;

Members of the fathers' rights movement criticize the [[best interests]] of the child standard currently used in many countries for making custody decisions, which they describe as highly subjective and based on the personal prejudices of family court judges and court-appointed child custody evaluators,&lt;ref name="Fathers &amp; Families Comment on NYT article"&gt;{{cite web | title = New York Times Press Gives Major Press Coverage for Fathers | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | date = 2005-05-08 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/site/news.php?id=54 | accessdate = 2007-05-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070828231255/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/site/news.php?id=54 | archivedate = 28 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Children's rights"&gt;{{cite web | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | title = Children's rights should include life with both parents | date = 2007-07-23 | url = http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=21639 | accessdate = 2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatherphobia"&gt;{{cite news | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | title = The Fatherphobia of Family Courts | date = 2005-02-02 | url = http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2005/feb05/05-02-02.html | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Family Feud"&gt;{{cite web | last = Newdow | first = M | title = Family Feud | publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = 2004-06-18 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2102650/ | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that courts are abusive when more than half custody is taken away from a willing, competent parent.&lt;ref name="ACFC Appeal to Parents"&gt;{{cite web | title = An Appeal to the Parents of America about the Destruction of the American Family | publisher = [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] | url = http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/ACFC2saved.pdf?docID=181 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070508050549/http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/ACFC2saved.pdf?docID=181 | archivedate = 8 May 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement including Ned Holstein state that a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting is supported by a majority of citizens.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F Testimony"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | title = Testimony in Support of an Act Relative to Shared Parenting | date = 2003-09-25 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Test%20HB%202464%20Custody.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026184257/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Test%20HB%202464%20Custody.pdf | archivedate = 26 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville writes that proposals to enact shared parenting laws are opposed by divorce lawyers, and he says that "radical feminist" groups oppose shared parenting because of the possibility of domestic violence and child abuse.&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 303"&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that shared parenting has been demonstrated to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, and that it is the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict.&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 305"&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Seltzer |first=Judith | title = Father by Law: Effects of Joint Legal Custody on Nonresident Fathers' Involvement With Children | journal = Demography | volume = 35| issue = 2 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9622777 | pages = 135–46 | doi=10.2307/3004047}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support is at the same time an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | title = Child Cost Economics and Litigation Issues: An Introduction to Applying Cost Shares Child Support Guidelines | author = R.

Stephen Baskerville describes no-fault or unilateral divorce based on no fault as a power grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers have a constitutional right to shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children.&lt;ref name="Divorced From Reality"&gt;{{cite web | title = Divorced From Reality | publisher = [[Touchstone (magazine)|Touchstone]] | date = January 2009 | url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=22-01-019-f | accessdate = 2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parental Authority"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Baskerville | title = Fathers' Rights Are Fathers' Duties | publisher = FatherMag.Com | date = 1998–2000 | url = http://www.fathermag.com/803/action/ | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F Position Paper"&gt;{{cite web | title = Position Paper of Fathers &amp; Families | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028142738/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | archivedate = 28 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pro-feminist]] sociologist [[Michael Flood]] states that supporters of shared parenting use it only as a symbolic issue related to "rights", "equality", and "fairness" and that the father's rights movement is not actually interested in the shared care of their children or the children's wishes, adding that fathers' rights groups have advocated policies and strategies that are harmful to mothers and children and also harmful to the fathers themselves.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite conference | first = M | last = Flood | title = Separated Fathers and the Fathers' Rights Movement | booktitle = Feminism, Law and the Family Workshop | publisher = Law School, University of Melbourne | date =  | url = http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | format = DOC | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207223803/http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | archivedate = 7 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, social scientist [[Sanford Braver]] states that the bad divorced dad image is a myth that has led to harmful and dangerous social policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child support===
{{See also|Child support|paternity fraud}}
Members of the fathers' rights movement campaign for the reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and on the assumption that the children live with one parent and never with the other.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | title = Comments on the Child Support Guidelines | publisher = F.A.C.T.

Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Morgan | first = LW | title = The "Cost Share" model of child support guidelines | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art200407.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solangel Maldonado states that the law should value a broader definition of fathering for poor fathers by reducing the focus on collecting child support and encouraging the informal contributions (such as groceries, clothes, toys, time with the children) of these fathers by counting these contributions as child support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maldonado | first = S | title = Deadbeat or Deadbroke: Redefining Child Support for Poor Fathers | year = 2006 | url = http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-06-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306021547/http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | archivedate = 6 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the fathers' rights movement state that child support should be terminated under certain conditions, such as if the custodial parent limits access to the children by moving away against the wishes of the other parent, gives fraudulent testimony, or if paternity fraud is discovered,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"&gt;{{cite web | title = Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement June 2001 | date = June 2001 | url = http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406095103/http://fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | archive-date = 6 April 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that two men should not have to pay child support for the same child.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"/&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that it is often difficult for fathers in financial hardship or who take on a larger caregiving role with their children to have their child support payments lowered. He also states that unemployment is the primary cause of child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"&gt;{{cite web | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = Is There Really A Fatherhood Crisis? | publisher = The Independent Institute | year = 2004 | url = http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=13&amp;articleID=35 | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that the purpose of child support should be publicly determined, and enforcement programs must be designed to serve that purpose, observing the due process of law.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

Supporters of the fathers' rights movement assert that some women make false claims of domestic violence, sexual or child abuse in order to gain an upper hand in divorce, custody disputes and/or prevent fathers from seeing their children, and they state that lawyers advise women to make such claims.&lt;ref name="gavanas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatherphobia"/&gt; They state that false claims of domestic violence and child abuse are encouraged by the inflammatory "win or lose" nature of child custody hearings, that men are presumed to be guilty rather than innocent by police and by the courts,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Controlling DV Against Men"&gt;{{cite web | title = Controlling Domestic Violence Against Men|last1=Corry|first1=CE|last2=Fiebert|first2= MS|last3=Pizzey|first3= E| publisher = Equal Justice Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ejfi.org/DV/dv-9.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers and advocates for abused women assert that family court proceedings are commonly accompanied with allegations of domestic violence because of the prevalence of domestic violence in society rather than as a result of false allegations of domestic violence. They also assert that domestic violence often begins or increases around the time of divorce or separation.&lt;ref name=" Ottaman"/&gt; Academic critic, Michael Flood, argues that fathers' rights groups have had a damaging impact on the field of domestic violence programming and policy by attempting to discredit female victims of violence, to wind back the legal protections available to victims and the sanctions imposed on perpetrators, and to undermine services for the victims of men's violence.&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flood | first = Michael | year = 2010 | title = ‘Fathers' Rights' and the Defense of Paternal Authority in Australia | journal = Violence Against Women | publisher = Sage | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–347 | url = http://www.xyonline.net/content/fathers-rights-and-defence-paternal-authority-australia | doi=10.1177/1077801209360918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Baskerville asserts that when child abuse occurs the perpetrator is not likely to be the father, and that child abuse most often occurs after the father has been separated from his children.&lt;ref name="Divorce as revolution"/&gt; Baskerville proposes that domestic violence and child abuse must be adjudicated as criminal assault, observing due process protections, and that government funding for programs addressing these issues must be made contingent on such protections.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

===Parenting time interference===
{{See also|Gatekeeper parent|Parental alienation syndrome}}

[[Glenn Sacks]] states that some mothers interfere with the father's parenting time and that such interference should be stopped.&lt;ref name="Parenting Time Interference a problem for dads"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Thompson | first1 = D | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | title = Equal Parents Week Highlights Need for Family Court Reform | publisher = GlennSacks.Com | date = 2002-09-26 | url = http://glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214213644/http://www.glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | archivedate = 14 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacks and [[Jeffery M.

Fathers' rights activists have also advocated for the inclusion of parental alienation syndrome, a proposed syndrome developed by [[Richard A. Gardner]] that alleges unjustified disruption of the relationship between a parent and a child is caused by the other parent.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Stephen Baskerville]] states that laws establishing no-fault divorce did not stop at removing the requirement that grounds be cited for a divorce, so as to allow for divorce by "mutual consent"; it also allows either spouse to end the marriage without any agreement or fault by the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Schlafly]] states that no-fault divorce should be referred to as unilateral divorce.&lt;ref name=Keynote&gt;{{cite web | title = Phyllis Schlafly's keynote address | publisher = [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | format = wmv | last = Schlafly | first = P | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926002543/http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | archivedate = 26 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that laws establishing no-fault divorce can be seen as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that it is not possible to form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746/&gt; He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against what he describes as the confiscation of their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baskerville states that fault has entered through the back door in the form of child custody hearings, and that the forcibly divorced spouse ("defendant") is presumed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other members of the fathers' rights movement believe that men fail to get appropriate recognition of their innocence as a result of no-fault divorce.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt; Baskerville describes a proposed amendment of no-fault divorce laws that would create a [[rebuttable presumption]] that custody of any minor children be awarded to the respondent [who is innocent or does not wish to divorce] regardless of gender. He also notes the predictions of Tim O'Brien, the author of the proposed amendment, who states that the proposed amendment would result in a plummeting divorce rate and reduced negative consequences for children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville proposes "reasonable limits" on no-fault divorce when children are involved.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the FRM support the end of the no-fault principle in child custody and divorce decisions.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;&lt;ref name="khader"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khader | first = Serene J. | date = October–December 2008 | title = When Equality Justifies Women's Subjection: Luce Irigaray's Critique of Equality and the Fathers' Rights Movement | journal = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy | publisher = Indiana University Press | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 48–74 | doi = 10.2979/HYP.2008.23.4.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Cheltenham"&gt;{{cite web | title = Restoring Control over matrimonial and family law | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.ukmm.org.uk/publics/rcomfl/report.htm | publisher = The Cheltenham Group | accessdate = 2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the fathers' rights movement state that the availability of divorce should also be limited.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;

===Government involvement===
Stephen Baskerville states that governments throughout the United States and other democracies are engaged, by accident or design, in a campaign against fathers and fatherhood, which in his view, lies at the root of a larger problem that threatens marriage, destroys families, devastates the lives of many children, and undermines [[parents]], [[democracy]] and [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, pp. 18, 268, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville also states that it is the removal of the father from the family through divorce that initiates problems for which the government is perceived as the solution rather than the problem, and that these problems are then used to justify the continued existence and expansion of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that modern divorce involves government officials invading parents' private lives, evicting people from their homes, seizing their property, and taking away their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gavanas | first = A | title = Making Men Into Fathers: Men, Masculinities and the Social Politics of Fatherhood | year = 2002 | editor-last = Hobson | editor-first = B | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZHeEA4syMUC&amp;pg=PA220 |page=220 | isbn = 0-511-02952-7 | chapter = The Fatherhood Responsibility Movement: the centrality of marriage, work and male sexuality in reconstructions of masculinity and fatherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental and reproductive rights===
{{Main|Parents' rights movement}}
Fathers' rights advocates have worked for the right of unwed, otherwise fit, fathers to get custody if the mother tries to have their child [[adoption|adopted]] by a third party or if child welfare authorities place the child in [[foster care]].&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shanley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shanley |first=Mary Lyndon |title=Making babies, making families: what matters most in an age of reproductive technologies, surrogacy, adoption, and same-sex and unwed parents|publisher=Beacon Press |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3GnloZRnWOAC&amp;pg=PA44 |pages=46–47 |isbn=0-8070-4409-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers' rights activists seek a gender-neutral approach in which unwed men and women would have equal rights in adoption issues, an approach that critics state does not sufficiently acknowledge the different biological roles in procreation and pregnancy, and the disparity in society's social and economic structures.&lt;ref name="shanley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-91027-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fineman |first=Martha |title=The neutered mother, the sexual family, and other twentieth century tragedies |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-415-91027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}} In the US, some states have passed laws to protect the rights of unwed fathers to custody. Courts have increasingly supported these rights, though judges often require evidence that the father has shown interest in, and given financial and emotional support to, the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-59337-369-4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Godwin |first=Raymond |last2=Beauvais-Godwin |first2=Laura |title=The Complete Adoption Book: Everything You Need to Know to Adopt a Child |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n0BIlzqdvMEC&amp;pg=PA96 |pages=96–97 |isbn=1-59337-369-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fathers' rights advocates have sought the right to prevent women from having an [[abortion]] without the father's consent, on the basis that it is discriminatory for men not to have the ability to participate in a decision to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7614-7907-4"&gt;{{cite book |publisher =Marshall Cavendish Corporation |title=Sex and Society Volume 2 |author =Marshall Cavendish |year=2009 |isbn=0-7614-7907-4 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&amp;pg=PA596 |page=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option is not supported by any laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2007/&gt; Fathers' rights advocates Jeffrey M. Leving and [[Glenn Sacks]] have stated that "choice for men is a flawed solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=3&amp;num=7589 |title=Respect a Man's Choice, Too |last1=Leving |first1=Jeffery M. |last2=Sacks |first2=Glenn |date=9 August 2006|publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=2010-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates have also expressed the desire to have a [[Male abortion|"financial abortion"]] in which the option exists to sever all responsibility for child support for an unwanted child. Commenting on this, legal scholar Kim Buchanan states, "The only way men's lack of a pregnancy opt-out can be framed as a gender injustice is to accept that men have a right to visit the consequences of unprotected sex (or contraceptive failure) exclusively on their female partners."&lt;ref name=Buchanan2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=KS|title=Lawrence v.

===Parental leave===
{{Main|Paternity leave}}
Pressure from father's rights groups, among others, have in several countries resulted in gender-neutral program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including the need to protect the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize gender-neutral child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children's care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with their infants.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Maureen, Parental Benefit Policies and the Gendered Division of Labor The Social Service Review, Vol. 71, No. 1 (March 1997), pp. 51–71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30012606]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7391-0688-0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reese |first1=Laura A. |last2=Gottfried |first2=Heidi |title=Equity in the workplace: gendering workplace policy analysis |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=2004 |pages= 187–88|isbn=0-7391-0688-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dK5p625del8C&amp;pg=PA187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Some fathers' rights activists object to the term "visitation", which they see as denigrating to their level of authority as parents, and instead prefer the use of "parenting time".&lt;ref&gt;[[#crowley2008|Crowley]], 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some legal scholars and feminist writers have accused the fathers' rights movement of putting the interests of fathers above the interests of children, for example, by suggesting that it is acceptable for fathers to withdraw child support if they are not given access to their children, or by lobbying for changes in family law that would allegedly heighten children's exposure to abusive fathers, and would allegedly further endanger mothers who are victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Miranda|author2=Julia Tolmie|title=Discoursing Dads: The Rhetorical Devices of Fathers' Rights Groups|journal=Melbourne University Law Review|year=1998|volume=22|pages=172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly|last=Behre|date=13 June 2014|title=The Fathers' Rights Movement Undermines Victims of Domestic Violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/06/13/fathers-rights-and-womens-equality/the-fathers-rights-movement-undermines-victims-of-domestic-violence|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that father's rights activists allegedly incorrectly maintain that the courts are biased against fathers, while in reality the vast majority of cases are settled by private agreement and fathers voluntarily relinquish primary custody of their children, which explains the lower percentage of custodial fathers; and that the "bias" of courts is in favour of the primary caregiver, not mothers per se.&lt;ref name="Separation Divorce and Remarriage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossi2004"/&gt;

Researchers [[Martha Fineman]], [[Michael Flood]], and others have criticized the movement for allegedly perpetuating negative stereotypes of women as deceptive, vindictive, and irresponsible, as well as the stereotype that women are out to take advantage of men financially.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanigsberg|first=Julia E.|title=Mother Troubles: Rethinking Contemporary Maternal Dilemmas|year=1999|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-6787-3|page=150|author2=Sara Ruddick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Health Equity Impact Analysis''' is a decision support tool which walks users through the steps of identifying how a program, [[policy]] or similar initiative will impact [[populations|population groups]] in different ways. HEIAs are meant to show, ''inter alia'', unintended potential impacts. The goal is to maximize positive impacts and reduce negative impacts that could potentially widen [[health]] [[health disparity|disparities]] between population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/heia/|title=Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) - Ministry Programs - Health Care Professionals - MOHLTC|work=gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12472">The '''Health Utilities Index''' (HUI) is a rating scale used to measure general health status and health-related [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] (HRQoL).  HUI questionnaires are designed to map onto two classification systems, HUI-2 and HUI-3, capable of measuring 24,000 and 972,000 unique health states, respectively.  HUI classifications measure a range of health domains with examples including sensation, mobility, pain, cognition, ambulation, and emotion.  [[Health utility]] values are commonly produced using HUI as a component of the [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) calculation used in [[population health]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthutilities.com/|title=Health Utilities Inc. "Leaders in Health-Related Quality of Life Research"|website=www.healthutilities.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Originally developed by [[McMaster University]] in Canada, HUI has subsequently evolved and been adapted by Health Utilities Inc.  The purpose of developing HUI was to create a standardized classification system using preference-based scoring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horsman|first=John|last2=Furlong|first2=William|last3=Feeny|first3=David|last4=Torrance|first4=George|date=2003-10-16|title=The Health Utilities Index (HUI®): concepts, measurement properties and applications|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|volume=1|pages=54|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-1-54|issn=1477-7525|pmc=293474|pmid=14613568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HUI was modeled using [[multi-attribute utility]] theory to assess a participants overall health-related quality of life.  HUI was first used to evaluate HRQoL in very-low birth weight infants and adolescent cancer morbidity and has since been taken by thousands of respondents from hundreds of researchers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The attribute categories were decided upon after consulting the general public to rank their order of importance.  Using [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|Von Neumann-Morganstern utility theorem]] to measure a participants health status, health state responses for each attribute are converted to a standardized health utility value which is discussed in detail below.

HUI-2 and HUI-3 questionnaires are proprietary and available for use from Health Utilities Inc. website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There is a licensing fee to use the questionnaire and generally costs $3,000 for a single research project use.  Included in the license is a manual describing how to convert survey responses into attribute levels.

== Scale Classification Systems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ==

=== HUI-2 ===
HUI-2 classification system consists of 7 attributes including sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self-care, pain and fertility.  Fertility is not currently used in the HUI-2 questionnaire, but was included historically to account for the effects of infertility on health-related quality of life.  Participants answering each attribute chooses one of three to five response items.  HUI-2 is capable of identifying 24,000 unique health states.  A level 1 response indicates no difficulty or interference while the highest level in each of the attributes corresponds to the lowest possible quality of life.  The following table shows the number of health state levels for each attribute:
{| class="wikitable"

=== HUI-3 ===
HUI-3 classification system consists of 8 attributes including vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain.  These attributes range from five or six levels of health states for each attribute.  HUI-3 is capable of identifying 972,000 unique health states.  Consistent with HUI-2, a level 1 response indicates the best possible health state for a given attribute while the highest level indicates the worst possible health state.  The following table show the number of health state levels for each attribute:

=== Differences between HUI-2 and HUI-3 ===
The HUI-3 was created to update the HUI-2 response categories after some of the attribute response items were criticized for not having application to the general population studies.  For example, the HUI-2 emotion attribute focuses on distress and anxiety while HUI-3 emotion focuses on happiness compared to depression.  The HUI-2 pain attribute is primarily concerned with the severity of pain whereas HUI-3 is concerned with frequency and control of pain.  Cognition in HUI-2 focuses on learning while HUI-3 focuses on problem-solving ability of participants.  In addition, sensation in the HUI-2 was broken down into vision, hearing, and speech for HUI-3 update.

== Scoring&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

A health state identification can be established for each of the possible health states in the HUI-2 and HUI-3.   A unique health state is described as a sequence of numbers based on the level selected for each attribute.  In HUI-2, perfect health is described as a sequence of seven one's in a row (i.e., 1111111).  HUI health state levels are converted to health utilities using either single-attributes and multi-attributes.  Each defined health state level are assigned a health utility value and used in the formula described below.  The utility values are determined using [[Time-trade-off|time trade-off]] methods which determine preferences for particular health states.

In HUI, utility values range from -0.03 and -0.36 for the HUI-2 and HUI-3, respectively, to 1.00.  A health utility value of 1.00 indicates perfect health while a score of 0.00 indicates death.  To account for the fact that some health states are identified by the general public as being worse than death.  To calculate a health utility score, health states for each response are converted using a look-up table and mathematical formula.  Each attribute and level has a corresponding coefficient value to be input into the formula to calculate health utility.

Each of these coefficients would be entered into the following formula to yield a general health utility:

&lt;math&gt;U=1.06(Sensation*Mobility*Emotion*Cognition*Self-Care*Pain*Fertility)-0.06&lt;/math&gt;

=== HUI-3 ===
For single attribute utility scores in HUI-3, a table published on the Health Utilities Inc. website provides the corresponding health utility score.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For multi-attribute utility functions, a separate table is used that accounts for an overall health utility based on each of the eight attributes in HUI-3.  The following table provides the associated coefficients used in the health utility formula:

For each health state, the attribute level selected in the response is entered into the following health utility formula:

&lt;math&gt;U = 1.371 (Vision*Hearing*Speech*Ambulation*Dexterity*Emotion*Cognition*Pain)-0.371&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
A health state for a respondent of the following:   
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Vision
!Hearing
!Speech
!Ambulation
!Dexterity
!Emotion
!Cognition
!Pain
|-
|'''Level'''
|1
|2

|}
The corresponding coefficients associated with each attribute and level are entered into the above formula as:

U = 1.371(1*0.95*0.94*0.86*0.95*0.85*0.92*0.77)-0.371

The results of the calculation yields an overall health utility of 0.231.  This value indicates the respondents overall health status on a standardized scale which can be compared to other utilities.

== Current Use ==
Since its development, HUI classification systems have been used extensively in clinical studies.  HUI-2 and HUI-3 are used to elicit health status score from respondents which are converted to health utility scores.  Health utility scores are then used in clinical trials to assess quality-adjusted life years as a result of clinical interventions.  HUI has been studied in disease states across the health spectrum including [[cancer]], [[stroke]], and [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grootendorst|first=Paul|last2=Feeny|first2=David|last3=Furlong|first3=William|date=March 2000|title=Health Utilities Index Mark 3: Evidence of Construct Validity for Stroke and Arthritis in a Population Health Survey|url=|journal=Medical Care|doi=10.1097/00005650-200003000-00006|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Scott D.|last2=Berry|first2=Kristin|last3=Moinpour|first3=Carol|last4=Giedzinska|first4=Antoinette|last5=Andersen|first5=M.

Quality-adjusted life years are calculated by multiplying the number of life years gained by the health utility.  The adjustment accounts for the changes in health-related quality of life for a given health state as a result of treatment.  Common applications include [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] and [[Comparative effectiveness research|comparative-effectiveness]] analysis which are types of economic analysis.  These type of analyses are used to inform decisions about the amount of value a particular treatment provides relative to other treatments at a population level of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/hug/update.htm|title=HUI Update|website=fhs.mcmaster.ca|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, HUI classification systems have focused on evaluating population health to make macro-level decisions about health care utilization, however,  its use to identify health status of individuals for use in a clinical setting is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furlong|first=William J.|last2=Feeny|first2=David H.|last3=Torrance|first3=George W.|last4=Barr|first4=Ronald D.|date=2001-01-01|title=The Health Utilities Index (HUI®) System for Assessing Health-Related Quality of Life in Clinical Studies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hpa/wpaper/200102.html|publisher=Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis (CHEPA), McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Validity and Reliability ==
Since its introduction in 1991, HUI questionnaires and classification systems have been translated into 35 different languages and have been used by 300 investigators across 20 different countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Research has demonstrated that HUI provides comparable measures of general health status to the [[SF-36]] and [[EQ-5D]], other well established questionnaires used in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raat|first=Hein|last2=Bonsel|first2=Gouke J.|last3=Essink-Bot|first3=Marie-Louise|last4=Landgraf|first4=Jeanne M.|last5=Gemke|first5=Reinoud J.B.J.|title=Reliability and validity of comprehensive health status measures in children|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435601004115|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1016/s0895-4356(01)00411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="103966">'''Health equity''' refers to the study and causes of differences in the quality of [[health]] and [[healthcare]] across different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of a Few Key Public Health Terms|url=http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/ohd/glossary.html|publisher=Office of Health Disparities, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health equity is different from health equality, as it refers only to the absence of disparities in controllable or remediable aspects of health. It is not possible to work towards complete equality in health, as there are some factors of health that are beyond human influence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO | Equity. (n.d.). ''WHO''. Retrieved February 27, 2014, from http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Inequity implies some kind of social injustice. Thus, if one population dies younger than another because of genetic differences, a non-remediable/controllable factor, we tend to say that there is a health inequality. On the other hand, if a population has a lower life expectancy due to lack of access to medications, the situation would be classified as a health inequity.&lt;ref&gt;Kawachi I., Subramanian S., Almeida-Filho N. "A glossary for health inequalities. ''J Epidemiol Community Health'' 2002;56:647–652;56:647–652&lt;/ref&gt; These inequities may include differences in the "presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care"&lt;ref name=goldberg-ohio&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; between populations with a different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnic groups|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]] or [[socioeconomic]] status.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Health equity falls into two major categories: horizontal equity, the equal treatment of individuals or groups in the same circumstances; and vertical equity, the principle that individuals who are unequal should be treated differently according to their level of need.&lt;ref&gt;JAN. Economic Analysis For Management And Policy [e-book]. Open University Press; 2005 [cited 2013 Mar 21]. Available from: MyiLibrary. &lt;http://lib.myilibrary.com?ID=95419&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities in the quality of health across populations are well-documented globally in both developed and developing nations. The importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;Vandemoortele, Milo (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4751&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equity-development The MDGs and equity] Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socioeconomic status ==
[[Socioeconomic status]] is both a strong predictor of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt;. Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the [[Capability approach#Capabilities|capabilities]] of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both [[Financial capital|financial]] and [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ben-Shlomo Yoav, White Ian R., Marmot Michael | year = 1996 | title = Does the Variation in the Socioeconomic Characteristics of an Area Affect Mortality? | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7037| pages = 1013–1014 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7037.1013| pmc = 2350820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health. In the UK, prior to the institution of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] reforms in the early 2000s, it was shown that income was an important determinant of access to healthcare resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morris S. |author2=Sutton M. |author3=Gravelle H. | year = 2005 | title = Inequity and inequality in the use of health care in England: an empirical investigation | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 1251–1266 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.07.016 |pmid=15626522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because one's job or career is a primary conduit for both financial and social capital, work is an important, yet under represented, factor in health inequities research and prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahonen|first=Emily Quinn|last2=Fujishiro|first2=Kaori|last3=Cunningham|first3=Thomas|last4=Flynn|first4=Michael|date=2018-01-18|title=Work as an Inclusive Part of Population Health Inequities Research and Prevention|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=108|issue=3|pages=306–311|doi=10.2105/ajph.2017.304214|pmid=29345994|pmc=5803801|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore unaffordable to certain populations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawachi I., Kennedy B.

In China, for instance, the collapse of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., Jackson, S., Carmichael, G. and Sleigh, A.C., 2009. Catastrophic medical payment and financial protection in rural China: evidence from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in Shandong Province. Health economics, 18(1), pp.103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising [[income inequality]] in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Zhongwei 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhao Zhongwei | year = 2006 | title = Income Inequality, Unequal Health Care Access, and Mortality in China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 461–483 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in Tanzania, it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider: a significant step towards stronger healthcare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some scholars have noted that unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of "underinvestment in social goods, such as public education and health care; disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, [[social capital]] plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = House J.

Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty used by some programs in the developing world appear to lead to a reduction in the likelihood of being sick.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |pmid=29139110 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence can guide resource allocations to effective interventions.

=== Education ===
Education is an important factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don’t know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Falkingham Jane | year = 2003 | title = Inequality and Changes in Women's Use of Maternal Health-Care Services in Tajikistan | url = | journal = Studies in Family Planning | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 32–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2003.00032.x| pmid = 12772444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schellenberg J.

== Spatial disparities in health ==
{{see also|Healthcare reform in China}}

For some populations, access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Banerjee, A., Banerjee, A. V., &amp; Duflo, E. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=em3_AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty]''. PublicAffairs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Global physician density map - WHO 2010.png|thumb|Global concentrations of healthcare resources, as depicted by the number of physicians per 100,000 individuals, by country.]]Costa Rica, for example, has demonstrable health spatial inequities with 12–14% of the population living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Inequity has decreased in some areas of the nation as a result of the work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosero-Bixby L | year = 2004 | title = Spatial access to health care in Costa Rica and its equity: a GIS-based study | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 58 | issue = 7| pages = 1271–1284 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00322-8 | pmid = 14759675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the 1980s as a result of the degradation of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu Y. |author2=Hsiao W. C. |author3=Eggleston K. | year = 1999 | title = Equity in health and health care: the Chinese experience | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 10| pages = 1349–1356 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00207-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant poverty experienced by rural workers (some earning less than 1 USD per day) further limits access to healthcare, and results in malnutrition and poor general hygiene, compounding the loss of healthcare resources.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Zhongwei 2006"/&gt; The loss of the CMS has had noticeable impacts on life expectancy, with rural regions such as areas of Western China experiencing significantly lower life expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;Qian Jiwei. (n.d.). ''Regional Inequality in Healthcare in China''. East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Xu T, Xu J | year = 2007 | title = Factors Contributing to High Costs and Inequality in China's Health Care System | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 16| pages = 1928–1930 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.16.1928 | pmid=17954544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities. A study by [[Jane Falkingham]] noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Ethnic and racial disparities==
{{see also|Race and health}}

Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that [[Race and health in the United States|these racially centered disparities continue to exist]] and are a significant social health issue.&lt;ref name="Weinick"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weinick R. M. |author2=Zuvekas S. H. |author3=Cohen J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Racial and ethnic differences in access to and use of health care services, 1977 to 1996.

A 2002 study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Eric C.|date=2002-03-13|title=Racial Disparities in the Quality of Care for Enrollees in Medicare Managed Care|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194724|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=287|issue=10|doi=10.1001/jama.287.10.1288|issn=0098-7484|page=1288}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX1838000217&amp;&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX1838000217&amp;docType=GALE|title = African American Poverty Leads to Health Disparities|date = 2010|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = UXL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage, with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non-ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care. The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventative and [[ambulatory]] care.&lt;ref name="Weinick" /&gt; A 2010 study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the [[Institute of Medicine]] has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like: insurance status, household income, education, age, geographic location and quality of living conditions. Even when the researchers corrected for these factors, the disparities persist.&lt;ref name="unequal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson A | year = 2002 | title = Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 94 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery has contributed to [[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|disparate health outcomes for generations of African Americans in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskins|first1=Darrell J.|title=RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND WEALTH: THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND PAST DISCRIMINATION|journal=Review of Black Political Economy|date=Spring 2005|volume=32|issue=America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost|page=95|accessdate=|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12114-005-1007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent. A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across 11 African nations (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) was published in 2000 by the WHO. The study described the presence of significant ethnic parities in the child mortality rates among children younger than 5 years old, as well as in education and vaccine use.&lt;ref name=pmid10686731&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10686731 |pmc=2560588 |year=2000 |author1=Brockerhoff |first1=M |title=Inequality of child mortality among ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=30–41 |last2=Hewett |first2=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services, including healthcare based upon race and social class, and the resultant health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bloom G. |author2=McIntyre D. | year = 1998 | title = Towards equity in health in an unequal society | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 10| pages = 1529–1538 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(98)00233-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McIntyre D. |author2=Gilson L. | year = 2002 | title = Putting equity in health back onto the social policy agenda: experience from South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 11| pages = 1637–1656 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00332-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries. The Pygmys of Congo, for instance, are excluded from government health programs, discriminated against during public health campaigns, and receive poorer overall healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ohenjo N. |author2=Willis R. |author3=Jackson D. |author4=Nettleton C. |author5=Good K. |author6=Mugarura B. | year = 2006 | title = Health of Indigenous people in Africa | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9526| pages = 1937–1946 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68849-1 |pmid=16765763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of five European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bollini P. |author2=Siem H. | year = 1995 | title = No real progress towards equity: Health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the eve of the year 2000 | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 819–828 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(94)00386-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study of race-based health inequity in Australia revealed that [[Indigenous health in Australia|Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality]] than non-Aborigine populations. Aborigine populations experienced 10 times greater mortality in the 30–40 age range; 2.5 times greater infant mortality rate, and 3 times greater age standardized mortality rate. Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population (16 and 15 times greater respectively), which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group. At this point in time, the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples were highest in Australia, when compared to the US, Canada and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mooney G | year = 1996 | title = And now for vertical equity?

In addition, retrospective epidemiological studies on LGBT populations are difficult to conduct as a result of the practice that sexual orientation is not noted on death certificates.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt; WHO has proposed that more research about the LGBT patient population is needed &amp;nbsp;for improved understanding of its &amp;nbsp;unique health needs and barriers to accessing care.&lt;ref&gt;CD52/18: Addressing the causes of disparities in health service access and utilization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) persons. 2013. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/populations/lgbt_paper/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the need for LGBT healthcare research, the Director of the [[National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities]] (NIMHD) at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] designated sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) as a health disparity population for NIH research in October 2016.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Meads, C.; Pennant, M.; McManus, J.; Bayliss, S.

Additionally, members of the LGBT community contend with health care disparities due, in part, to lack of provider training and awareness of the population’s healthcare needs.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Studies regarding patient-provider communication in the LGBT patient community show that providers themselves report a significant lack of awareness regarding the health issues LGBT-identifying patients face.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; As a component of this fact, medical schools do not focus much attention on LGBT health issues in their curriculum; the LGBT-related topics that are discussed tend to be limited to HIV/AIDS, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

LGBT health issues have received disproportionately low levels of medical research, leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBT treatment.

A June 2017 review sponsored by the European commission as part of a larger project to identify and diminish health inequities, found that LGB are at higher risk of some cancers and that LGBTI were at higher risk of mental illness, and that these risks were not adequately addressed.  The causes of health inequities were, according to the review, "i) cultural and social norms that preference and prioritise heterosexuality; ii) minority stress associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics; iii) victimisation; iv) discrimination (individual and institutional), and; v) stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Health4LGBTI |title=State-of-the-art study focusing on the health inequalities faced by LGBTI people D1.1 State-of-the-Art Synthesis Report (SSR) June, 2017 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/social_determinants/docs/stateofart_report_en.pdf |date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Health disparities in the male population ===
As sex and gender are inextricably linked in day-to-day life, their union is apparent in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males tend to have a health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, early marriage, and domestic abuse for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fikree|first=FF|last2=Pasha|first2=O|date=2004|title=Role of gender in health disparity: the South Asian context|url=|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=328 | issue = 7443 |pages=823–826|via=|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7443.823|pmid=15070642|pmc=383384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/child-adolescenthealth/New_Publications/ADH/WHO_FCH_CAH_00.7.pdf|title=What about boys?

In a number of countries, males also face a heightened risk of mortality as a result of behavior and greater propensity for violence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Physicians tend to offer invasive procedures to male patients more than female patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kent|first=Jennifer|last2=Patel|first2=Vinisha|last3=Varela|first3=Natalie|date=2012|title=Gender Disparities in Healthcare|url=|journal=Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine|volume=79|issue=5|pages=555–559|via=|doi=10.1002/msj.21336|pmid=22976361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, men are more likely to smoke than women and experience smoking-related health complications later in life as a result; this trend is also observed in regard to other substances, such as marijuana, in Jamaica, where the rate of use is 2–3 times more for men than women.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Lastly, men are more likely to have severe chronic conditions and a lower life expectancy than women in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courtenay|first=Will H|date=2000-05-16|title=Constructions of masculinity and their influence on men's well-being: a theory of gender and health|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=50|issue=10|pages=1385–1401|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00390-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.4452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health disparities in the female population ===
Gender and sex are also components of health disparity in the female population. The 2012 [[World Development Report]] (WDR) noted that women in [[Developing country|developing nations]] experience greater [[mortality rate]]s than men in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2012). World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of [[maternal death]] than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or [[child mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronsmans|first=Carine|last2=Graham|first2=Wendy J|title=Maternal mortality: who, when, where, and why |journal=The Lancet|volume=368|issue=9542|pages=1189–1200|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69380-x|pmid=17011946|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women in the United States tend to live longer than men, they generally are of lower [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Jen'nan Ghazal|last2=Gorman|first2=Bridget K.|date=2010|title=Gender and Health Inequality |journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=371–386|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, which can lead to higher rates of [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Women are also more likely than men to suffer from [[Sexual violence|sexual]] or [[Intimate partner violence|intimate-partner violence]] both in the United States and worldwide.

Women have better access to healthcare in the United States than they do in many other places in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaidya|first=Varun|last2=Partha|first2=Gautam|last3=Karmakar|first3=Monita|date=2011-11-14|title=Gender Differences in Utilization of Preventive Care Services in the United States |journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=21|issue=2|pages=140–145|doi=10.1089/jwh.2011.2876|pmid=22081983|issn=1540-9996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one population study conducted in Harlem, New York, 86% of women reported having privatized or publicly assisted health insurance, while only 74% of men reported having any health insurance.

This has led to post-approval [[Adverse effect|adverse events]] among women, resulting in several drugs being pulled from the market.

=== Cultural factors ===
Health disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in [[China]], health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mu|first=Ren|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaobo|date=2011-01-01|title=Why does the Great Chinese Famine affect the male and female survivors differently?

In [[India]], gender-based health inequities are apparent in early childhood. Many families provide better nutrition for boys in the interest of maximizing future productivity given that boys are generally seen as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Behrman J. R.|year=1988|title=Intrahousehold Allocation of Nutrients in Rural India: Are Boys Favored? Do Parents Exhibit Inequality Aversion?|url=|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=40|issue=1|pages=32–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, boys receive better care than girls and are hospitalized at a greater rate.

Additionally, the cultural practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is known to impact women's health, though is difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n practice, it may have roots in the [[Middle East]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uwer|first=Thomas von der Osten-Sacken ; Thomas|date=2007-01-01|title=Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?|url=http://www.meforum.org/1629/is-female-genital-mutilation-an-islamic-problem/|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/|title=Female genital mutilation (FGM)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and [[Urinary retention|urine retention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rhmjournal.org.uk/2015/03/immediate-health-consequences-of-female-genital-mutilation/|title=Immediate health consequences of female genital mutilation {{!}} Reproductive Health Matters: reproductive &amp; sexual health and rights|date=2015-03-01|work=Reproductive Health Matters: reproductive &amp; sexual health and rights|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term consequences include [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[bacterial vaginosis]], [[Dyspareunia|pain during intercourse]], and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/en/publications/gynecological-consequences-of-female-genital-mutilation-cutting-fgm-c|title=Gynecological consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C)|website=Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter for helsetjenesten|language=en|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Rigmor|last2=Underland|first2=Vigdis|date=June 10, 2013|title=The Obstetric Consequences of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2013/496564/abs/|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/496564|pmid=23878544|pmc=3710629|via=|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus 2]] (HSV2) than women who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrendt|first=Alice|last2=Moritz|first2=Steffen|date=2005-05-01|title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Memory Problems After Female Genital Mutilation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=5|pages=1000–1002|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1000|pmid=15863806|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morison|first=Linda|last2=Scherf|first2=Caroline|last3=Ekpo|first3=Gloria|last4=Paine|first4=Katie|last5=West|first5=Beryl|last6=Coleman|first6=Rosalind|last7=Walraven|first7=Gijs|date=2001-08-01|title=The long-term reproductive health consequences of female genital cutting in rural Gambia: a community-based survey |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=643–653|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00749.x|issn=1365-3156|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00749.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals living in rural areas, especially poor rural areas, have access to fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/field-based-outreach-workers-facilitate-access-health-care-and-social-services-underserved |title=Field-Based Outreach Workers Facilitate Access to Health Care and Social Services for Underserved Individuals in Rural Areas |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disparities in access to health care==

Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:

* '''Lack of [[universal health care]] or [[health insurance]] coverage'''. Without health insurance, patients are more likely to postpone medical care, go without needed medical care, go without prescription medicines, and be denied access to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tikkanen|first1=Roosa Sofia|last2=Woolhandler|first2=Steffie|last3=Himmelstein|first3=David U.|last4=Kressin|first4=Nancy R.|last5=Hanchate|first5=Amresh|last6=Lin|first6=Meng-Yun|last7=McCormick|first7=Danny|last8=Lasser|first8=Karen E.|title=Hospital Payer and Racial/Ethnic Mix at Private Academic Medical Centers in Boston and New York City|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=47|issue=3|date=2 February 2017|pages=460–476|doi=10.1177/0020731416689549|pmid=28152644|pmc=6090544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (KCMU), "The Uninsured and Their Access to Health Care" (December 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the [[National Health Service|NHS]].
* '''Lack of a regular source of care'''. Without access to a regular source of care, patients have greater difficulty obtaining care, fewer doctor visits, and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs. Compared to whites, minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use [[emergency rooms]] and [[clinics]] as their regular source of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fryer G. E. |author2=Dovey S. M. |author3=Green L. A. | year = 2000 | title = The Importance of Having a Usual Source of Health Care | url = | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 62 | issue = | page = 477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, which is much more racially harmonious, this issue arises for a different reason; since 2004, NHS [[General practitioners|GPs]] have not been responsible for care out of normal GP surgery opening hours, leading to significantly higher attendances in [[Emergency department|A+E]]
* '''Lack of financial resources'''. Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans, the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Fund (CMWF), [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/1999/May/Analysis-Of-Minority-Health-Reveals-Persistent--Widespread-Disparities.aspx "Analysis of Minority Health Reveals Persistent, Widespread Disparities,"] press release (May 14, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Legal]] barriers'''. Access to medical care by low-income immigrant minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs.  For example, in the United States federal law bars states from providing [[Medicaid]] coverage to [[immigrants]] who have been in the country fewer than five years.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J.

Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be when a non-English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person's language. This is mostly seen in Hispanic people who do not speak English. 
* '''Structural barriers'''. These barriers include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), "National Healthcare Disparities Report," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The health care financing system'''. The [[Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"/&gt;
* '''Scarcity of providers'''. In inner cities, rural areas, and communities with high concentrations of minority populations, access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners, specialists, and diagnostic facilities.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2002/Mar/Diverse-Communities--Common-Concerns--Assessing-Health-Care-Quality-for-Minority-Americans.aspx K. Collins, D. Hughes, M. Doty, B. Ives, J. Edwards, and K. Tenney, "Diverse Communities, Common Concerns: Assessing Health Care Quality for Minority Americans]," Commonwealth Fund (March 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] (a [[quango]]) has a legal obligation to ensure that sufficient provision exists in all parts of the nation.
* '''Linguistic barriers'''. Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who are not [[English language|English]]-proficient.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Law Program and the Access Project (NHeLP), Language Services Action Kit: Interpreter Services in Health Care Settings for People With Limited English Proficiency (February 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health [[literacy]].''' This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"/&gt; A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determinants of access to and use of maternal health care services in the Eastern Cape, South Africa- a quantitative and qualitative investigation|last = Mluleki Tsawe|first = Appunni Sathiya Susuman|date = 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-723|pmid = 25315012|pmc = 4203863|access-date =|volume=7|pages=723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lack of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the health care workforce'''. A major reason for disparities in access to care are the [[cultural]] differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients. Only 4% of physicians in the United States are African American, and Hispanics represent just 5%, even though these percentages are much less than their groups' proportion of the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Age.''' Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodie M, Flournoy RE, Altman DE | year = 2000 | title = Health information, the Internet, and the digital divide | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255| pmid = 11192412 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

==Disparities in quality of health care==

Health disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity/race which includes:

=== Problems with patient-provider communication ===
Communication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care.   The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey" /&gt; Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J. R.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers.  Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.  The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=L.|author2=Flores, G.|title=Pay Now or Pay Later: Providing Interpreter Services in Health Care|journal=Health Affairs|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=24|issue=2|pages=435–444|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.435|pmid=15757928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes.  Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient.  However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|title=Physician Language Ability and Cultural Competence|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=Feb 2004|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30266.x|pmc=1492135|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flores|title=Errors in Medical Interpretation and their Potential Clinical Consequences in Pediatric Encounters|journal=Pediatrics|date=Jan 2003|volume=111|issue=1|pages=6–14|doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.6|pmid=12509547|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.9277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamers|author2=McNulty|title=Professional Interpreters and Bilingual Physicians in a Pediatric Emergency Department|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|date=Nov 2002|volume=156|issue=11|pages=1108–1113|doi=10.1001/archpedi.156.11.1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers.   It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting.  Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment.  So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=A.|author2=Eisenberg, L. |title=Culture, Illness and Care: Clinical Lessons for Anthropologic and Cross Culture Research|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=1978|volume=88|issue=2|pages=251–258|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-88-2-251|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA2roY9wVq0C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Heterosexism+in+Health+and+Social+Care&amp;ei=SF1fSq6DDJbyzQSX4JnBBQ&amp;hl=en Handbook of health behavior research, David S. Gochman]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provider discrimination ===
Provider [[discrimination]] occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients. This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic/racial groups. Doctors are more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Ryn|first=M.|author2=Burke, J.|title=The effect of Patient Race and Socio-economic Status on Physicians' Perceptions on Patients|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2000|volume=50|issue=6|pages=813–828|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00338-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur regardless of consideration for education, income, and personality characteristics. Two types of stereotypes may be involved, [[Implicit stereotype|automatic stereotypes]] or goal modified stereotypes.  Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments/behaviors outside of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Burgess 2006 119–134"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=D.

Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smedley B. |author2=Stith A. |author3=Nelson A. | year = 2002 | title = Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Institute of Medicine | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of preventive care ===
According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Habib JL | year = 2010 | title = Progress lags in infection prevention and health disparities | url = http://www.patientcareonline.com/drug-benefit-trends/progress-lags-infection-prevention-and-health-disparities | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, minorities are not regularly screened for [[colon cancer]] and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms.&lt;ref name=pmid9276652&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9276652 |pmc=1497155 |year=1997 |author1=Woloshin |first1=S |title=Is language a barrier to the use of preventive services? |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=472–7 |last2=Schwartz |first2=L. M |last3=Katz |first3=S. J |last4=Welch |first4=H. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing, flu immunizations and pap smears.&lt;ref name=pmid11520385&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016007468.x |pmid=11520385 |pmc=1495243 |title=Impact of interpreter services on delivery of health care to limited-English-proficient patients |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=468–74 |year=2001 |last1=Jacobs |first1=Elizabeth A |last2=Lauderdale |first2=Diane S |last3=Meltzer |first3=David |last4=Shorey |first4=Jeanette M |last5=Levinson |first5=Wendy |last6=Thisted |first6=Ronald A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[Public Health England]], a universal service free at the point of use, which forms part of the NHS, offers regular screening to any member of the population considered to be in an at-risk group (such as individuals over 45) for major disease (such as colon cancer, or diabetic-retinopathy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screening.nhs.uk/programmes UK-wide screening programmes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screening.nhs.uk/cms.php?folder=2844 England-specific programmes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans for achieving health equity==
There are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts, some examples include:

* '''Advocacy'''. Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y. K. |author4=Costongs C. | year = 2015 | title = Advocacy for Health Equity: A Synthesis Review | url = | journal = Milbank Quarterly | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–437 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.12112 |pmid=26044634 |pmc=4462882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/health-advocacy-toolkit/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Provider based incentives to improve healthcare for ethnic populations'''. One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.&lt;ref&gt;http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. 
* '''Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)'''. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, J. R., &amp; Maina, A. (2007). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59745-485-8_5 Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice]. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM’s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.&lt;ref&gt;Maxey, R. W., &amp; Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Increasing awareness'''. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.
* '''The Gradient Evaluation Framework'''. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The AIM framework'''. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.
* '''Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health'''. In 2017, citing the need for accounatbility for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health inequalities==
Health inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].

In [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a "social gradient in health": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the Joint Action Health Equity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21–22 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.

==Poor health and economic inequality==
[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.1. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbtCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger]. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; mental health,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.3.Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; obesity,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 7.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.
The United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.
The negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.3. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Healthy Life Years''' indicator (HLY) is a European structural indicator computed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301003227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=HLTH_HLYE Eurostat]. It is one of the summary measures of population health, known as health expectancies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu/pdf/Glossary_v4.pdf Glossary EurOhex website]&lt;/ref&gt; composite measures of health that combine [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] data to represent overall population health on a single indicator.&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Robine. ''Summarizing health status''. In: Pencheon D, Guest C, Melzer D, Gray JAM, editors. Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;160-168&lt;/ref&gt; HLY measures the number of remaining years that a person of a certain age is expected to live without disability. It is actually a disability-free [[life expectancy]].

== History ==
The European Union has decided to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide synthetic measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;B. Cox, H. Van Oyen, E. Cambois, C. Jagger, S. Le Roy, J-M Robine, I.Romieu. The reliability of the Minimum European Health Module. ''International Journal of Public Health'' 2009;(54):55-60 (DOI 10.1007/s00038-009-7104-y), p57&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1177:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)]&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 to be one of the structural indicators to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals ([[Lisbon Strategy]]) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/indicators/lifeyears_en.htm Health Life Years in the core of the Lisbon Strategy ]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chrodis.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and diabetes.'''   

Detailed information on the Health Expectancies in Europe are available from the EurOhex Advanced research on European health expectancies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu EurOhex]&lt;/ref&gt; while latest Healthy Life Years values can be found on the general public website devoted to the Healthy Life Years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthy-life-years.eu healthy-life-years.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Dramatic increases in [[life expectancy]] in the most developed countries - and therefore in the countries of the European Union - constitute one of the most remarkable advances of the last decades. But why prolong life if this is to be accompanied by increases in severe mental and physical impairment? Thus a further challenge confronts the European Community:
:''increasing life expectancy in good health.''

In this context, the classical mortality indicators are no longer sufficient to monitor the health status of European populations. The availability of health expectancy indicators dividing life expectancy into life spent in different states of health is useful to health authorities in the field of [[public health]] and [[health policy|health policies]] provided that these indicators allow comparisons over time and between geographic areas and between socio-economic groups in society. As the post-war generation reaches retirement, the pace of ageing will increase dramatically in our European societies, with profound social effects. HLY is an important indicator :
* Health of a population is inherently difficult to measure because it is often defined differently among individuals, populations, cultures, and even across time periods.
* Many studies focus on measures such as physical impairment or disability in functional tasks or presence of a specific chronic disease. Self-assessed health, being much more global and subjective in nature, can incorporate a variety of aspects of health including cognitive and emotional as well as physical status, and therefore provide insights into the needs of an [[ageing]] society. Hence, self-assessed health measures as HLY may be a particularly important indicator of the potential demand for health services and long-term care needs.
* The two components of the calculation of the HLY are life tables and self-perceived disability assessed by health surveys. From 1995 to 2001, data from the Eurostat European Community Household Panel (ECHP) survey have been used for the EU-15 Member States. Its successor, the Eurostat EU-SILC has been used from 2005 onwards for the EU-25 and then 27 Member States.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

== Example ==
[[File:HLY 2010.jpg|thumb|Healthy Life Years in Europe - 2010]]
* The HLY estimates are provided for the 27 EU Member States using the EU-SILC data for 2010 (see graph above)
* The first analyses of the healthy life years values disclose significant inequalities among the European countries.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jagger, C. Gillies, F. Mascone, E. Cambois, H. Van Oyen, W.J. Nusselder, J.-M. Robine, EHLEIS team. Inequalities in healthy life years in the 25 countries of the European Union in 2005: a cross-national meta-regression analysis. ''The Lancet'' 2008;372(9656):2124-2131 (DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61594-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical Findings==
Different estimations are made for men and women. In 2015, the number of healthy years of women in the EU-28 was estimated to be at 63.3 years and of men to be at 62.6 years. The interesting part of this is that the gender gap was considerably smaller in regards to healthy life years than to overall life expectancy. This would imply that biologically, gender would not really affect the rate and time at which humans would become healthy yet gender would play a role in how long human beings would be able to live in an unhealthy state. 

==Data Sources and their Availability==
Eurostat calculates information about the healthy life years at three different ages during a person's life. One is at birth, another is at age 50, and the third is at age 65, with an indicator used separately for men and women. The data is calculated and collected by using mortality statistics as well as self perceived longstanding activity limitations- a dimension that captures longstanding limitation in regards to health and/or disability to perform usual and frequent activities. 
An example of a question that might be asked concerning the longstanding activity limitation is: "For the last six months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities that people usually do?" Some available answers are "severely limited", "limited but not severely", or "not limited at all".

'''High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)''' is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid accumulation in the lungs) that occurs in otherwise healthy [[mountaineers]] at altitudes typically above {{Convert|2500|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name=Borden&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roach |first1=James M. |last2=Schoene |first2=Robert B. |editor1-first=Kent B. |editor1-last=Pandolf |editor2-first=Robert E. |editor2-last=Burr |title=Medical Aspects of Harsh Environments |volume=2 |chapter=High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema |publisher=Borden Institute|location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |pages=789–814 |url=https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch25.pdf |oclc=64437370}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cases have also been reported at lower altitudes (between {{convert|1500|-|2500|m|ft|disp=or}} in highly vulnerable subjects), though what makes some people [[Susceptible individual|susceptible]] to HAPE is currently unknown. HAPE remains the major cause of death related to high-altitude exposure, with a high mortality rate in the absence of adequate emergency treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Physiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.org/home.php|publisher=Altitude.org |title=Why do low oxygen levels cause altitude sickness?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lake Louise Consensus Definition for high-altitude pulmonary edema has set widely used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lake Louise Consensus on the Definition of Altitude Illness|work=High Altitude Medicine Guide|publisher=Thomas E. Dietz|accessdate=2012-11-10|url=http://www.high-altitude-medicine.com/AMS-LakeLouise.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms: at least two of:
* [[dyspnea|Shortness of breath]] at rest
* Cough
* Weakness or decreased exercise performance
* Chest tightness or congestion

Signs: at least two of:
* Crackles or wheezing (while breathing) in at least one lung field
* Central [[cyanosis|blue skin color]]
* [[Tachypnea]] (rapid breathing)
* [[Tachycardia]] (rapid heart rate)

The initial cause of HAPE is a shortage of [[oxygen]] caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes.&lt;ref name=Borden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kenneth Baillie |author2=Alistair Simpson | title=Barometric pressure calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/high_altitude.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology EXpeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mechanisms by which this oxygen shortage causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:
# Increased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures ([[pulmonary hypertension]]) secondary to [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199110313251805 |last1=Bärtsch|first1=P|last2=Maggiorini|first2=M|last3=Ritter|first3=M|last4=Noti|first4=C|last5=Vock|first5=P|last6=Oelz|first6=O|displayauthors=4 |title=Prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema by nifedipine |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=325 |issue=18 |pages=1284–9 |date=October 1991 |pmid=1922223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An [[idiopathic]] non-inflammatory increase in the [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] of the vascular [[endothelium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swenson|first1=ER|last2=Maggiorini|first2=M|last3=Mongovin|first3=S|title=Pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema: inflammation is not an etiologic factor |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=17 |pages=2228–35 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11980523 |doi=10.1001/jama.287.17.2228|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although higher pulmonary arterial pressures are associated with the development of HAPE, the presence of [[pulmonary hypertension]] may not in itself be sufficient to explain the development of [[edema]]: severe pulmonary hypertension can exist in the absence of clinical HAPE in subjects at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maggiorini|first1=M|last2=Mélot|first2=C|last3=Pierre|first3=S|title=High-altitude pulmonary edema is initially caused by an increase in capillary pressure |journal=Circulation |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=2078–83 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11319198 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/103/16/2078.long |doi=10.1161/01.cir.103.16.2078|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
Individual susceptibility to HAPE is difficult to predict. The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Persons with [[sleep apnea]] are susceptible due to irregular breathing patterns while sleeping at high altitudes.

==Prevention==
Prevention is by gaining elevation slowly over days. The medications [[acetazolamide]], [[dexamethasone]], or [[nifedipine]] may also be used.&lt;ref name=Mer2018Pro&gt;{{cite web |title=Altitude Diseases - Injuries; Poisoning |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/injuries-poisoning/altitude-diseases/altitude-diseases |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=3 August 2018 |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The standard and most important treatment is to descend to a lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.&lt;ref name=Borden/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18578641"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luks|first1=AM |title=Do we have a 'best practice' for treating high altitude pulmonary edema? |journal=High Altitude Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=111–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18578641 |doi=10.1089/ham.2008.1017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but more severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments are [[dexamethasone]]&lt;ref name="Maggiorini M, Brunner-La Rocca HP, Peth S, et al. 2006 497–506"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maggiorini|first1=M|last2=Brunner-La Rocca|first2=HP|last3=Peth S|title=Both tadalafil and dexamethasone may reduce the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary edema: a randomized trial |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=145 |issue=7 |pages=497–506 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17015867 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-145-7-200610030-00007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nifedipine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bärtsch|first1=P|last2=Swenson|first2=Erik R.|first3=ER|last4=Maggiorini|first4=M |title=Update: High altitude pulmonary edema |journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |volume=502 |issue= |pages=89–106 |year=2001 |pmid=11950158 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3401-0_8|last3=Maggiorini|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-1-4419-3374-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as [[sildenafil]] and [[tadalafil]] are also effective&lt;ref name="Maggiorini M, Brunner-La Rocca HP, Peth S, et al. 2006 497–506"/&gt; but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates|first1=MG|last2=Thompson|first2=AA|last3=Baillie|first3=JK |title=Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema |journal=Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=226–31 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17408118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of clinical HAPE in unacclimatized travelers exposed to high altitude (~{{Convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=or}}) appears to be less than 1%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The [[United States Army Pike’s Peak Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Pike's Peak Research Laboratory]] has exposed sea-level-resident volunteers rapidly and directly to high altitude; during 30 years of research involving about 300 volunteers (and over 100 staff members), only three have been evacuated with suspected HAPE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Research==
To help understand factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004. The database is administered by [[Apex (altitude physiology expeditions)|APEX]], a high altitude medical research charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International HAPE database |url=http://www.altitude.org/hape.php |publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology EXpeditions) |accessdate=2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database to help researchers study the condition.

Over time they have described from 4 to 11 [[food groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various guides have been criticized as not accurately representing scientific information about optimal nutrition, and as being overly influenced by the agricultural industries the USDA promotes.

== Earliest guides ==
The USDA's first nutrition guidelines were published in 1894 by Dr. [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]] as a farmers' bulletin.&lt;ref name=USDAHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Recommendations and How They Have Changed Over Time|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42215/5831_aib750b_1_.pdf|work=America's Eating Habits: Changes and Consequences|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011|format=PDF|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/CAT87201446 |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 23 - Foods : Nutritive Value and Cost |last=Atwater |first=W.O. |year=1894 |website=Internet Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Atwater's 1904 publication titled ''Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value of Food,'' he advocated variety, proportionality and moderation; measuring [[food energy|calories]]; and an efficient, affordable diet that focused on nutrient-rich foods and less fat, sugar and [[starch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Food Pyramid History|url=http://www.healthy-eating-politics.com/usda-food-pyramid.html|work=Healthy Eating Politics|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value of Food|url=https://archive.org/stream/principlesofnutr00atwa|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information preceded the discovery of individual [[vitamin]]s beginning in 1910.

A new guide in 1916, ''Food for Young Children'' by nutritionist Caroline Hunt, categorized foods into milk and meat; cereals; vegetables and fruits; fats and fatty foods; and sugars and sugary foods. ''How to Select Food'' in 1917 promoted these five food groups to adults, and the guidelines remained in place through the 1920s. In 1933, the USDA introduced food plans at four different cost levels in response to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=USDAHistory/&gt;

In 1941, the first [[Dietary Reference Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowances]] were created, listing specific intakes for [[food energy|calories]], [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron]], [[calcium#Nutrition|calcium]], and vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[niacin|B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin D|D]].&lt;ref name=USDAHistory/&gt;

== Basic 7 ==
[[File:USDA_-_Basic_7_Food_Groups.jpg|thumb|The USDA's "Basic 7" food groups from 1943 to 1956.]]
In 1943, during [[World War II]], The USDA introduced a [[nutrition guide]] promoting the "Basic 7" [[food group]]s to help maintain nutritional standards under wartime [[Rationing#United States|food rationing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food Demonstrations To Be Held Over Nation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b9U-AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6605,3660154|accessdate=2 June 2011|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|date=2 April 1943|agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To Demonstrate "Basic 7" Diet|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qXNhAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4981,1684677|accessdate=2 June 2011|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=2 April 1943|agency=The Associated Press|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Basic 7 food groups were:

# Green and yellow vegetables (some raw; some cooked, frozen or canned)
# Oranges, tomatoes, [[grapefruit]] (or raw [[cabbage]] or [[leaf vegetable|salad greens]])
# Potatoes and other vegetables and fruits (raw, dried, cooked, frozen or canned)
# Milk and milk products (fluid, [[evaporated milk|evaporated]], [[powdered milk|dried milk]], or cheese)
# Meat, poultry, [[fish (food)|fish]], or [[egg (food)|eggs]] (or dried [[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], or [[peanut butter]])
# Bread, flour, and cereals (natural [[whole grain]], or [[enriched flour|enriched]] or restored)
# Butter and [[food fortification|fortified]] [[margarine]] (with added Vitamin A)

== Basic Four ==
From 1956 until 1992 the United States Department of Agriculture recommended its "Basic Four" food groups.&lt;ref name=Basic4&gt;{{cite web|title=The thing the professor forgot|url=http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/hgb2290001.xml?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=National%20Agricultural%20Library%20Digital%20Repository&amp;Index=HGB&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=fname%3D%22HGB2290001.XML%22&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=&amp;TocRestrict=&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;Doc=%3Cdocument%20name%3D%22hgb2290001.xml%22%20path%3D%22%5C%5CNALDR%5CDIGITAL2%5CZYFILES%5CINDEXDATA%5CHGB%5CXML%5C2009%5C00000002%5C%22%20index%3D%22HGB%22%2F%3E&amp;File=%5C%5CNALDR%5CDIGITAL2%5CZYFILES%5CINDEXDATA%5CHGB%5CXML%5C2009%5C00000002%5Chgb2290001.xml&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=&amp;MaximumDocuments=0&amp;FuzzyDegree=-1&amp;ImageQuality=r85g16_r85g16_x150y150g16_i500&amp;Display=&amp;DefSeekPage=&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionE&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=-1&amp;ZyEntry=20&amp;SeekPage=f|work=National Agriculture Library Digital Repository|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These food groups were:

* Vegetables and fruits: Recommended as excellent sources of vitamins C and A, and a good source of [[fiber]]. Four or more servings from this group were recommended daily. Previous USDA food guides showed vegetables and fruits as unique groups, each with at least two recommended servings per day.
* Milk: Recommended as a good source of calcium, [[phosphorus]], protein, riboflavin, and sometimes vitamins A and D. Cheese, [[ice cream]], and [[ice milk]] could sometimes replace milk. Four servings from this group for teens and two for adults were recommended as a minimum daily.
* Meat: Two daily servings at least were recommended for protein, iron and certain [[B vitamins]]. Includes meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dry beans, dry peas, and peanut butter.
* Cereals and breads: Whole grain and enriched breads were especially recommended as good sources of iron, B vitamins and [[carbohydrate]]s, as well as sources of protein and fiber. Includes cereals, breads, [[cornmeal]], [[macaroni]], [[noodle]]s, rice and [[spaghetti]]. With the Basic Four daily food guide, the recommended minimum daily servings for the grains group doubled from two to four. Previously, in the Basic Seven guide, refined and non-enriched grains were included along with solid fats and sugar in a cluster of foods outside the essential seven.

"Other foods" were said to round out meals and satisfy appetites. These included additional servings from the Basic Four, or foods such as butter, margarine, [[salad dressing]] and [[cooking oil]], [[sauce]]s, [[Fruit preserves|jellies]] and [[syrup]]s.&lt;ref name=Basic4/&gt;

The Basic Four guide was omnipresent in nutrition [[education in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haddix|first=Carol|title=Four basic food groups grow up with the times|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=negLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6552,2002584|accessdate=12 June 2011|newspaper=Evening Independent|date=24 July 1985|agency=Chicago Tribune|location=St. Petersburg, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is the 1972 series [[Mulligan Stew (TV series)|Mulligan Stew]], providing nutrition education for schoolchildren in reruns until 1981.

== Food Guide Pyramid ==
[[File:USDA Food Pyramid.gif|thumb|The USDA's 1992 [[food guide pyramid]].]]
{{main|Food Guide Pyramid}}
The introduction of the USDA's [[food guide pyramid]] in 1992 attempted to express the recommended servings of each food group, which previous guides did not do. 6 to 11 servings of bread, cereal, rice and pasta occupied the large base of the pyramid; followed by 3 to 5 servings of vegetables; then fruits (2 to 4); then milk, yogurt and cheese (2 to 3); followed by meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts (2 to 3); and finally fats, oils and sweets in the small apex (to be used sparingly). Inside each group were several images of representative foods, as well as symbols representing the fat and sugar contents of the foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huston|first=Diane|title=Food guide pyramid is built on a base of grains|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2r4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4658,6907219|accessdate=12 June 2011|newspaper=Daily News|date=29 April 1992|agency=The Associated Press|location=Bowling Green, Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified food pyramid was proposed for adults aged over 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= |title=Modified Food Guide Pyramid for people over seventy years of age |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=129 |issue=3|pages=751–753 |year=1999 |last1=Russell |first1=Robert M.|last2=Rasmussen |first2=Helen |last3=Lichtenstein |first3=Alice H. |pmid=10082784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This "Modified Food Pyramid for 70+ Adults" accounted for changing diets with age by emphasizing water consumption as well as nutrient-dense and high-fiber foods.

=== Controversy===

The first chart suggested to the USDA by nutritional experts in 1992 featured fruits and vegetables as the biggest group, not breads. This chart was overturned at the hand of special interests in the grain, meat, and dairy industries, all of which are heavily subsidized by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|url=http://www.ajpmonline.org/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/3834-stamped-070913.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=September 2013|volume=  45| issue =  3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The 'Pyramid' emphasized eating more vegetables and fruits, less meat, salt, sugary foods, bad fat, and additive-rich factory foods. USDA censored that research-based version of the food guide and altered it to include more refined grains, meat, commercial snacks and fast foods, only releasing their revamped version 12 years after it was originally scheduled for release. " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Light, MS, EdD|first=Luise|title=Biography|url=https://www.amazon.com/Luise-Light/e/B001IR1Q8O/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1452825528&amp;sr=8-1|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MyPyramid ==
[[File:MyPyramidFood.svg|thumb|left|[[MyPyramid]], the revised USDA food pyramid.]]
{{main|MyPyramid}}
In 2005, the USDA updated its guide with [[MyPyramid]], which replaced the hierarchical levels of the Food Guide Pyramid with colorful vertical wedges, often displayed without images of foods, creating a more abstract design. Stairs were added up the left side of the pyramid with an image of a climber to represent a push for exercise. The share of the pyramid allotted to grains now only narrowly edged out vegetables and milk, which were of equal proportions. Fruits were next in size, followed by a narrower wedge for protein and a small sliver for oils. An unmarked white tip represented discretionary calories for items such as candy, alcohol, or additional food from any other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyPyramid -- Getting Started|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/downloads/MyPyramid_Getting_Started.pdf|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MyPlate==
[[File:USDA_MyPlate_green.svg|thumb|The [[MyPlate]] nutrition guide]]
{{main|MyPlate}}
MyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]],&lt;ref name=MyPlate&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a diagram of a plate and glass divided into five [[food group]]s. It replaced the USDA's [[MyPyramid]] diagram on June 2, 2011, ending 19 years of [[food guide pyramid|food pyramid]] iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nutrition Plate Unveiled, Replacing Food Pyramid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/03plate.html|accessdate=2 June 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guide will be displayed on food packaging and used in nutritional education in the United States.

==Dietary Guidelines==
{{main|Dietary Guidelines for Americans}}
The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] in the USDA and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] jointly released a longer textual document called ''[[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] 2015 - 2020'', to be updated in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietaryguidelines.htm |title=Dietary Guidelines &amp;#124; Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion |publisher=Cnpp.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition was published in 1980, and since 1985 has been updated every five years by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Backgrounder.pdf |title=2010 Dietary Guidelines For Americans |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094406/http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Backgrounder.pdf |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the USDA Food Pyramid, these guidelines have been criticized as being overly influenced by the agriculture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111216006064/en/Internal-Documents-Reveal-USDA-Dietary-Guidelines-Panel |title=Internal Documents Reveal USDA Dietary Guidelines Panel Dominated by ADA |publisher=Business Wire |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These criticisms of the Dietary Guidelines arose due to the omission of high-quality evidence that the Public Health Service decided to exclude. The phrasing of recommendations was extremely important and widely affected everyone who read it. The wording had to be changed constantly as there were protests due to comments such as “cut down on fatty meats”, which led to the U.S Department of Agriculture having to stop the publication of the USDA Food Book. Slight alterations of various dietary guidelines had to be made throughout the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to calm down the protests emerged. As a compromise, the phrase was changed to “choose lean meat” but didn’t result in a better situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nestle|first1=Marion|title=USDA's Dietary Guidelines: Heath Goals Meets Politics|url=http://www.foodpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/DietaryGuidelines_CNI_92.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the committee factored in environmental sustainability for the first time in its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://thehill.com/regulation/237767-vegan-diet-best-for-planet-federal-report-says|title = Vegan diet best for planet|last = Wheeler|first = Lydia|date = 5 April 2015|work = thehill.com|access-date = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's 2015 report found that a healthy diet should comprise higher plant based foods and lower animal based foods. It also found that a plant food based diet was better for the environment than one based on meat and dairy.&lt;ref name="Mic-20150407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/114710/government-report-confirms-vegan-lifestyle-really-is-better-for-your-body-and-your-planet|title=Government Report Confirms Vegan Lifestyle Really Is Better for Your Body and Your Planet|last=Kleeman|first= Sophie|date=2015-04-07|work=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 and again in 2015, Edward Archer and colleagues published a series of research articles in PlosOne and Mayo Clinic Proceedings demonstrating that the dietary data used to develop the US Dietary Guidelines were physiologically implausible (i.e., incompatible with survival) and therefore these data were "inadmissible" as scientific evidence and should not be used to inform public policy.

In 2016, Nina Teicholz authored a critique of the US Dietary Guidelines in the British Medical Journal titled The scientific report guiding the US dietary guidelines: is it scientific? Teicholz suggested that "the scientific committee advising the US government has not used standard methods for most of its analyses and instead relies heavily on systematic reviews from professional bodies such as the [[American Heart Association]] and the [[American College of Cardiology]], which are heavily supported by food and drug companies."

'''Human nutrition''' deals with the provision of [[essential nutrient]]s in food that are necessary to support human [[life]] and [[health]]. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, [[food security]] or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"&gt;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition (No. 4), UNICEF, May 2006, {{ISBN|978-92-806-3988-9}}. http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_33685.html&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths and [[Disability|disabilities]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions"&gt;World Health Organization.

== Overview ==
The human body contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates, [[amino acids]] (in [[proteins]]), [[fatty acids]] (in [[lipids]]), and [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds are composed of [[chemical element|elements]] such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (including [[urine]] and feces). Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main article|Nutrient}}

The seven major classes of nutrients are [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. These nutrient classes are categorized as either [[macronutrients]] or [[micronutrients]] (needed in small quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.medicinejournal.co.uk/|title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date = March 31, 2015|issue = 2|pages = 61–65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva [u.a.]|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/9241546123/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.

Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/95E87FE64B144FA3CA2568A9001393C0|title = National Nutrition Survey: Nutrient Intakes and Physical Measurements|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Nelson2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson DL, Cox MM |year=2005 |title=Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental  components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]], some of which are [[essential amino acids|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when [[atrophy]] takes place, or during periods of starvation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate}}

[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|upright|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of complex and simple carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain.

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Monosaccharides  include [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/carbohydrates-contain-monosaccharides-1181.html|title = Carbohydrates That Contain Monosaccharides|date = |accessdate = |website = Healthy eating|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaccharides include [[sucrose]], [[lactose]], and [[maltose]]; purified [[sucrose]], for instance, is used as table sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303914003338#|title = Principles of human nutrition|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date =|volume=43|issue = 2|pages=61–65|last1 = Lean|first1 = Michael E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysaccharides, which include [[starch]] and [[glycogen]], are often referred to as 'complex' carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple-branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in [[blood glucose]] levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases, which have become more common in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than in the past, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch, and starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fat===
{{Main article|Fat|Nutrition#Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}  Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fats]] are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Many studies have shown that consumption of unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, is associated with better health in humans. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next in order of preference, while trans fats are associated with a variety of disease and should be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Most fatty acids are not essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids – [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids – seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoids]] known as [[prostaglandins]], which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g., pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fiber===
{{Main article|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]], specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so.  Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of [[oligosaccharides]], [[waxes]], [[esters]], resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Whole grains, beans and other [[legumes]], fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For mechanical  reasons, fiber can help in alleviating both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high [[viscosity]]; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Protein===
{{Main article|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and form the [[enzyme]]s which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance).  Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed, they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web|url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amino acids which an animal cannot synthesize on its own from smaller molecules are deemed essential. The synthesis of some amino acids can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress, and those are called conditionally essential.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

===Minerals===
{{Main article|Mineral (nutrient)}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several [[metals]], which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Essential dietary minerals====
include the following:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below.
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.&lt;ref name="mahan"&gt;{{cite book | title= Krausw's Food and the Nutrition Care Process |edition=13th  |publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4377-2233-8 |author1=L.

* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 80% is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.&lt;ref name="USDA DB" /&gt;
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt.

====Trace minerals====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-935702-73-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Cobalt]] as a component of the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] family of [[coenzyme]]s
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]]
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxin]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see [[Iodine deficiency]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapil|first=Umesh|date=2016-11-22|title=Health Consequences of Iodine Deficiency|journal=Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=267–272|issn=2075-051X|pmc=3074887|pmid=21748117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in iodized salt
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes,  and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]]

===Vitamins===
{{Main article|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemicals]] have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: [[goiter]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorders]]), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0| author=Shils | displayauthors=etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malnutrition==
{{Main article|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.
Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption, according to the United Nations [[World Health Organization]], the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like “household food security, maternal and child care, health services, and the environment.” &lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

===Mental disorders===

Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc= 2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1|last2= Vieira }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because Lakhan and Vieira mentioned that the supplements possess amino acids that may change into neurotransmitters and improve mental disorders.

===Cancer===

Cancer has become common in developing countries. According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' – cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate – that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive worldwide report, "[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]", compiled by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]], reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle (including food consumption) and [[cancer prevention]]. The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet [[nutritional needs]] through diet alone, while limiting consumption of [[energy]]-dense foods, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] and avoiding [[sugary drink]]s, [[processed meat]] and moldy [[cereals]] (grains) or [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (legumes). Protein consumption leads to an increase in [[IGF-1]], which plays a role in cancer development.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Metabolic syndrome and obesity===

Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as decisive factors in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fernández-García JC |title=Inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome: dietary modulation |url= |journal=Curr Vasc Pharmacol |year=2013 |volume= 11|issue=October |pages=1570–1611 |doi= |pmc= |pmid=24168441  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/[[leptin]] resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors – such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals – contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. Evidence indicates that diets possibly protective against metabolic syndrome include low saturated and [[trans fat]] intake and foods rich in [[dietary fiber]], such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables and moderate intake of low-fat dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldeisen SE, Tucker KL |year= 2007|title=Nutritional strategies in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h06-101?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;#.UnaZ2FPDIwA |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=46–60 |doi=10.1139/h06-101 |pmc= |pmid=17332784 |accessdate=November 3, 2013|last2= Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global nutrition challenges==
The challenges facing global nutrition are disease, child malnutrition, obesity, and vitamin deficiency.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Disease===
The most common non-infectious diseases worldwide, that contribute most to the global mortality rate, are cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems, all of which are linked to poor nutrition. Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease, while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name=" GNP " /&gt;

Foodborne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition, and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease. Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting life-threatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to the WHO, in 2011, 6.9 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal conditions, of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF 2012 Progress Report: Rapid progress in child survival|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120913_unicef_childsurvivalreport/en/|accessdate=28 May 2016|publisher=World Health Organization|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA4"&gt;WHO.

===Child malnutrition===
{{Main article|Child malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, in 2011, 101 million children across the globe were underweight and one in four children, 165 million, were stunted in growth.&lt;ref name=ENA1&gt;UNICEF, WHO, World Bank. UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint child malnutrition estimates. New York, Geneva &amp; Washington DC, UNICEF, WHO &amp; World Bank, 2012 (http://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/estimates/en/index.html, accessed 27 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, there are 43 million children under five who are overweight or obese.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Nearly 20 million children under 5 suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; According to estimations at [[UNICEF]], [[hunger]] will be responsible for 5.6 million deaths of children under the age of five this year.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"/&gt; These all represent significant public health emergencies.&lt;ref name="GNP"&gt;WHO (2013). Global Nutrition Policy. Report of a WHO Expert Committee. Geneva, World Health Organization. http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/84408/1/9789241505529_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is because proper maternal and child nutrition has immense consequences for survival, acute and chronic disease incidence, normal growth, and economic productivity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60937-X |title=Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries |year=2013 |last1=Black |first1=Robert E |last2=Victora |first2=Cesar G |last3=Walker |first3=Susan P |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Christian |first5=Parul |last6=De Onis |first6=Mercedes |last7=Ezzati |first7=Majid |last8=Grantham-Mcgregor |first8=Sally |last9=Katz |first9=Joanne |last10=Martorell |first10=Reynaldo |last11=Uauy |first11=Ricardo |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9890 |pages=427–51 |pmid=23746772 |author12=Maternal Child Nutrition Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood [[malnutrition]] is common and contributes to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray C, Lopez A | title = Global mortality, disability, and the contribution of risk factors: Global Burden of Disease Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 349 | issue = 9063 | pages = 1436–42 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9164317 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07495-8| last2 = Lopez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status, because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness, which threatens cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Undernutrition===
{{Main article|Undernutrition}}
UNICEF defines undernutrition “as the outcome of insufficient food intake (hunger) and repeated infectious diseases. Under nutrition includes being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin (wasted), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrient).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Under nutrition causes 53% of deaths of children under five across the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35% of child deaths.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black RE | year = 2008 | title = Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608| pages = 243–260 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61690-0| pmid = 18207566 | author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Bhutta | last4 = Caulfield | last5 = De Onis | last6 = Ezzati | last7 = Mathers | last8 = Rivera }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition, “including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding- is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths and infant mortality, or 45% of all child deaths in 2011”.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition" /&gt;

When humans are undernourished, they no longer maintain normal bodily functions, such as growth, resistance to infection, or have satisfactory performance in school or work.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe, that one out of four under the age of five, are underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in school, more likely to become overweight and develop non-infectious diseases, and ultimately earn less than their non-stunted coworkers.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION"&gt;IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION &gt; UNICEF. (April 2013). IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION: The achievable imperative for global progress. http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_68661.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, undernutrition can accumulate deficiencies in health which results in less productive individuals and societies &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight, often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition, which results in worse growth, development, and health throughout the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt; Children born at low birthweight (less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg), are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those born at low birthweight also are likely to have a depressed immune system, which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Because 96% of low birthweight occurs in the developing world, low birthweight is associated with being born to a mother in poverty with poor nutritional status that has had to perform demanding labor.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child’s chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development, which reduces cognitive ability, academic performance, and eventually earning potential.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;  Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding, infectious disease susceptibility, and the mother’s nutrition and health status.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Therefore, malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic, especially in low and middle income countries.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;

Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011-2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits, vegetables, and meat products.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO (2012). The state of food insecurity in the world 2012: Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition. Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ (Accessed 7 December 2012.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

Undernourishment, or hunger, according to the FAO, is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, the size of the population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where undernourishment has steadily increased.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food.&lt;ref name="UNSCN09"&gt;UNSCN (2009). Global financial and economic crisis – The most vulnerable are at increased risk of hunger and malnutrition. United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition. http://www.unscn.org/en/publications/nutrition_briefs/#Nutrition_impacts_of_global_food_and_financial_crises.&lt;/ref&gt; High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute more-nutritious foods with low-cost alternatives.&lt;ref name="IBRD"&gt;IBRD, World Bank (2012).

Estimates say that 28.5% of the global population is iodine deficient, representing 1.88 billion individuals.&lt;ref name="Iodine"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andersson M, Karumbunathan V, Zimmermann MB | year = 2012 | title = Global iodine status in 2011 and trends over the past decade | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 142 | issue = 4| pages = 744–750 | doi=10.3945/jn.111.149393| pmid = 22378324 | last2 = Karumbunathan | last3 = Zimmermann }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although salt iodization programs have reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency, this is still a public health concern in 32 nations. Moderate deficiencies are common in Europe and Africa, and over consumption is common in the Americas.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt; Iodine-deficient diets can interfere with adequate thyroid hormone production, which is responsible for normal growth in the brain and nervous system. This ultimately leads to poor school performance and impaired intellectual capabilities.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Infant and young child feeding===
Improvement of breast feeding practices, like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually.&lt;ref name=ENA7&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13811-1 |title=How many child deaths can we prevent this year? |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Gareth |last2=Steketee |first2=Richard W |last3=Black |first3=Robert E |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Morris |first5=Saul S |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9377 |pages=65–71 |pmid=12853204 |author6=Bellagio Child Survival Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0–5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in [[Ghana]] suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants.&lt;ref name=ENA2P7&gt;WHO. Report of the expert consultation on the optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Geneva, WHO, 2001.{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding often indicates nutritional status because infants that consume breast milk are more likely to receive all adequate nourishment and nutrients that will aid their developing body and immune system. This leaves children less likely to contract diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Besides the quality and frequency of breastfeeding, the nutritional status of mothers affects infant health. When mothers do not receive proper nutrition, it threatens the wellness and potential of their children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Well-nourished women are less likely to experience risks of birth and are more likely to deliver children who will develop well physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Maternal undernutrition increases the chances of low-birth weight, which can increase the risk of infections and asphyxia in fetuses, increasing the probability of neonatal deaths.&lt;ref name=ENA23&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11925488 |year=2002 |last1=Ramakrishnan |first1=U |last2=Yip |first2=R |title=Experiences and challenges in industrialized countries: Control of iron deficiency in industrialized countries |volume=132 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=820S–4S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth failure during intrauterine conditions, associated with improper mother nutrition, can contribute to lifelong health complications.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Approximately 13 million children are born with [[intrauterine growth restriction]] annually.&lt;ref name=ENA2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61690-0 |title=Maternal and child undernutrition: Global and regional exposures and health consequences |year=2008 |last1=Black |first1=Robert E |last2=Allen |first2=Lindsay H |last3=Bhutta |first3=Zulfiqar A |last4=Caulfield |first4=Laura E |last5=De Onis |first5=Mercedes |last6=Ezzati |first6=Majid |last7=Mathers |first7=Colin |last8=Rivera |first8=Juan |journal=The Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9608 |pages=243–60 |pmid=18207566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International food insecurity and malnutrition==
{{further information|Underweight|Food security|Epidemiology of malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five, followed by sub-Saharan Africans nations, with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== United States===
In the United States, 2% of children are underweight, with under 1% [[stunted growth|stunted]] and 6% are [[wasting]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111115758/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|archivedate=2010-01-11|df=}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a [[MyPlate|plate of food]] which in 2011 superseded the [[MyPyramid|MyPyramid food pyramid]] that had replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrialized countries===
According to [[UNICEF]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] has the lowest rates of [[stunted growth|stunting]] and [[wasting]], at 14 percent and 3 percent.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nations of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania and Sweden have the lowest prevalence of low [[birthweight]] children in the world- at 4%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Proper prenatal nutrition is responsible for this small prevalence of low birthweight infants.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, low birthweight rates are increasing, due to the use of [[fertility drugs]], resulting in multiple births, women bearing children at an older age, and the advancement of technology allowing more pre-term infants to survive.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Industrialized nations more often face malnutrition in the form of over-nutrition from excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed greatly to the public health epidemic of obesity.&lt;ref name="P4C48"/&gt; Disparities, according to gender, geographic location and socio-economic position, both within and between countries, represent the biggest threat to child nutrition in industrialized countries. These disparities are a direct product of social inequalities and [[social inequalities]] are rising throughout the industrialized world, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===South Asia===
[[South Asia]] has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world, at approximately 78 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar, where 44% have not reached optimal height and 15% are wasted, rates much higher than any other regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region of the world has extremely high rates of child underweight- 46% of its child population under five is underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan alone account for half the globe’s underweight child population.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; South Asian nations have made progress towards the [[MDGs]], considering the rate has decreased from 53% since 1990, however, a 1.7% decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Some nations, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]], on the other hand, have made significant improvements, all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have made modest improvements, [[Nepal]] has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement, such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting, which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Causes of this poor nutrition include energy-insufficient diets, poor sanitation conditions, and the gender disparities in educational and social status.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status, where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In South Asia, 60% of children in the lowest quintile are underweight, compared to only 26% in the highest quintile, and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest.&lt;ref name="UNMDG2011"&gt;UN (2011b). The Millennium Development Goals report 2011. New York, United Nations. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/statistics/mdg-report-2011.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern/South Africa===

The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015, the most prevalent [[Millennium Development Goal]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine, declined agricultural productivity, food emergencies, drought, conflict, and increased poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This, along with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Botswana]] has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence, dropping 4% in 4 years, despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[South Africa]], the wealthiest nation in this region, has the second lowest proportion of underweight children at 12%, but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Almost half of [[Ethiopian]] children are underweight, and along with [[Nigeria]], they account for almost one-third of the underweight under five in all of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===West/Central Africa===
West/[[Central Africa]] has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Of the countries in this region, the Congo has the lowest rate at 14%, while the nations of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]] are improving slowly.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In [[Gambia]], rates decreased from 26% to 17% in four years, and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91% of vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children, with 10% of the population under five not at optimal weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five, whose rate stayed approximately the same.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world, due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate, at 238 deaths per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children  (23%) and low levels of exclusive breast feeding  (4%).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Anemia is prevalent in these nations, with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high rate of child wasting - 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries – [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Niger]] – where rates fall between 11% and 19% of under fives, affecting more than 1 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Middle East/North Africa===

Six countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015, and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations – [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Forty six percent of all children in [[Yemen]] are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Djibouti]], [[Jordan]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]] (OPT), [[Oman]], the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and [[Tunisia]] are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity, where the [[United Arab Emirates]], for example, despite being a wealthy nation, has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== East Asia/Pacific===

The [[East Asia]]/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by [[China]], the region’s most populous country.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]] has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides [[Iceland]], in the world, at 3%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cambodia]] has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume [[iodized salt]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Latin America/Caribbean===

This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  The [[Latin American]] region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 3.8% every year between 1990 and 2004, with a current rate of 7% underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world, with only 31 per 1000 deaths, and the highest [[iodine]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cuba]] has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The prevalence has also decreased in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Chile has a rate of underweight under 5, at merely 1%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The most populous nations, [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]], mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5, with only 6% and 8%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Guatemala]] has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region, with rates above 45%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; There are disparities amongst different populations in this region. For example, children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13%, compared to urban areas at 5%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition access disparities==

Occurring throughout the world, lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disparities in [[socioeconomic]] status, both between and within nations, provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations, where social inequality is on the rise.&lt;ref name=P4C43&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Organization, European Health Report 2005: Public health action for healthier children and populations|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen|date=2005|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82435/E87325.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be [[underweight]] as those in the richest.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those in the lowest wealth [[Household income in the United States#Quintiles|quintile]] and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and [[stunted growth|stunting]].&lt;ref name="WHOstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2013b)|publisher=World health statistics. Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/81965/1/9789241564588_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the developing world, socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets, regardless of the general rate of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="VanP"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van de Poel E|year=2008|title=Socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition in developing countries|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|issue=4|pages=241–320|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the greatest increase in [[childhood obesity]] has been seen in the lower middle income bracket.&lt;ref name="WHOglobe"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2011a). Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010|publisher=Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Latin American/Caribbean nations, “Children living in rural areas in Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas. That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru.” &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the United States, the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations, but particularly among [[minorities]].&lt;ref name=P4C45&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Polhamus B, etal |title=Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2003 Report, Table 18D|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta|date=2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pednss/pednss_tables/pdf/national_table18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world, except in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition policy==

===Nutrition interventions===
Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, nutrition interventions take a multi-faceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations. Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health. While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the health-sector, non-health sector interventions targeting agriculture, water and sanitation, and education are important as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Global nutrition micro-nutrient deficiencies often receive large-scale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, in 1990, iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent, with one in five households, or 1.7 billion people, not consuming adequate iodine, leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69% of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition, due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity, poor health resources, unhealthy environments, and poor healthcare practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disaster relief interventions often take a multi-faceted public health approach. UNICEF’s programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments, measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation, provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements, support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; For example, during Nigeria’s food crisis of 2005, 300,000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF, the Niger government, the World Food Programme, and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Interventions aimed at pregnant women, infants, and children take a behavioral and program-based approach. Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breast-feeding, the immediate initiation of breastfeeding, and its continuation through 2 years and beyond.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors, healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors, like healthy hospital environments, skilled health workers, support in the public and workplace, and removing negative influences.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Programs addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women. However, because supplementation often occurs too late, these programs have had little effect.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Interventions such as women’s nutrition, early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; A Cochrane review of community-based maternal health packages showed that this community-based approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lassi|first=Zohra S.|last2=Bhutta|first2=Zulfiqar A.|date=2015-03-23|title=Community-based intervention packages for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and improving neonatal outcomes|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=3|pages=CD007754|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007754.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25803792|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs have had adverse effects. One example is the “Formula for Oil” relief program in Iraq, which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula, which has negatively affected infant nutrition.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Implementation and delivery platforms===
In April 2010, the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled “Scaling up Nutrition (SUN): A Framework for action” that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet’s Series on under nutrition, and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61086-7 |title=Global child and maternal nutrition—the SUN rises |year=2013 |last1=Nabarro |first1=David |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9893 |pages=666–7 |pmid=23746773}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention, encouraging programming that was cost-effective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations, as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; This document was labeled the SUN framework, and was launched by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments, [[academia]], UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition- calling for country-based nutrition programs, increasing evidence based and cost–effective interventions, and “integrating nutrition within national strategies for [[gender equality]], agriculture, [[food security]], [[social protection]], education, water supply, sanitation, and health care”.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy. For instance, several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Political commitment in the form of evidence-based effective national policies and programs, trained skilled community nutrition workers, and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Market and industrial production can play a role as well. For example, in the [[Philippines]], improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services, other sectors, such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education, are vital for nutrition promotion as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

====Nutrition Education====
{{Main article|Nutrition Education}}
{{Main article|Food_studies#Food_and_Education}}

Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Nutrition for special populations==

===Sports nutrition===
{{Main article|Sports nutrition}}

====Protein====
The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; A review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

====Carbohydrates====
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate|title = Iowa State University: Extension and outreach|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes participating in endurance sports such as marathons to consume carbohydrates during their events.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Paediatric nutrition ===
Adequate nutrition is essential for the growth of children from infancy right through until adolescence. Some nutrients are specifically required for growth on top of nutrients required for normal body maintenance, in particular calcium and iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Food and Nutrition: Food and Health Systems in Australia and New Zealand|last = Wahlqvist|first = M.

==History==
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone-modification studies, have shown that [[cannibalism]] also occurred among prehistoric humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |year=1986 |last1=Villa |first1=P. |last2=Bouville |first2=C. |last3=Courtin |first3=J. |last4=Helmer |first4=D. |last5=Mahieu |first5=E. |last6=Shipman |first6=P. |last7=Belluomini |first7=G. |last8= Branca |first8= M. |journal= Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |pmid= 17794567|bibcode=1986Sci...233..431V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] developed about 10,000 years ago in multiple locations throughout the world, providing [[food grain|grain]]s (such as [[wheat]], [[rice]] and [[maize]]) and [[potatoes]]; and originating staples such as [[bread]] and pasta [[dough]]&lt;ref&gt;

===From antiquity to 1900===
[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|right|Anaxagoras]]
Around 3000 BC the [[Vedic texts]] made mention of scientific research on nutrition. The Bible's [[Book of Daniel]] recounts first recorded nutritional experiment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During an invasion of Judah, King [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylon]] captured Daniel and his friends. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days. On comparison with the king's men, they appeared healthier, and were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5-16] ([http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Daniel_1#5 alternative translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said: "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g |title='Let food be thy medicine…' |year=2004 |last1=Smith |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7433 |pages=0–g |pmc=318470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle.  In 1747 Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first attested [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored{{by whom|date=November 2014}} for forty years, but after about 1850 British sailors became known as "[[limey]]s". (Scientists would not identify the essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice until the 1930s.){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Around 1770 [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry", discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790 [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival.  In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized{{by whom|date=November 2014}} as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1816 [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrates]] and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s).  In the 1860s [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the early 1880s [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1896 [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands.  In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, demonstrating that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===From 1900 to the present===
In the early 20th century [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Wilcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats. He{{who|date=November 2014}} fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamins]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann 2e Biology Activity Manual by Judith Brotherton and Kate Mundie{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gowland Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize. In 1907 [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]]. This experiment ran through 1911.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1912 [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]] to label a vital factor in the diet: from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to derive from ammonia. The vitamins were studied{{by whom|date=November 2014}} in the first half of the 20th century. In 1913 [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]] and water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; later identified as a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] (1872-1935) and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] (1859–1929) also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919 Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency, because he could cure it in dogs with [[cod-liver oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D |publisher=United States National Academy of Sciences |date=April 29, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204111737/http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets, thus identifying [[vitamin D]]. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discovered [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, and originally called it "food factor X" until 1925.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1925 Hart discovered that [[iron]] absorption requires trace amounts of [[copper]]. In 1927 [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928 [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]]. In the 1930s [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize. In 1935 [[Eric Underwood]] and [[Hedley Marston]] independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]]. In 1936 [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance relate to caloric intake. In 1938 [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]] (1889–1971).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

From 1940 [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] – during and after World War II – took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941 the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] established the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs). In 1992 the U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. In 2002 a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior.

A '''hydrocele testis''' is an accumulation of clear fluid in the [[tunica vaginalis]], the most internal of membranes containing a [[testicle]]. A primary hydrocele causes a painless enlargement in the [[scrotum]] on the affected side and is thought to be due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary hydrocele is secondary to either inflammation or a [[neoplasm]] in the testis.

[[File:Ultrasonography of hydrocele.jpg|thumb|[[Scrotal ultrasound]] of a 1 dm large hydrocele, with [[Echogenicity|anechoic]] (dark) fluid surrounding the testicle.]]

A [[hydrocele]] usually occurs on one side, but can also affect both sides. The accumulation can be a marker of [[physical trauma]], [[infection]], [[tumor]] or [[varicocele]] surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=C|first1=Esposito|title=Incidence and management of hydrocele following varicocele surgery in children|pmid=14767329|doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000112928.91319.fe|volume=171|issue=3|journal=J Urol|pages=1271-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the cause is generally unknown. [[Indirect inguinal hernia]] indicates increased risk of hydrocele.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A hydrocele is normally seen in infant boys, as an enlarged scrotum. In infant girls, it appears as enlarged [[labia]]. However, hydroceles are more common in boys than girls.

==Signs and symptoms==
A hydrocele feels like a small fluid-filled balloon inside the [[scrotum]]. It is smooth, and is mainly in front of the testis. Hydroceles vary greatly in size and are typically painless and harmless. However, as the fluid continues to accumulate and the scrotum further enlarges, more discomfort can be expected. Large hydroceles will cause discomfort because of their size. Sometimes pain can be in both testicles as pressure from the enlarged area puts pressure against the unaffected area which can cause discomfort to the normal testicle.  It has also been found to decrease a man's sex drive and makes him less active for fear of enlarging the mass. As the fluid of a hydrocele is transparent, light shone through the hydrocelic region will be visible from the other side. This phenomenon is called transillumination. 

Symptoms of a hydrocele can easily be distinguished from [[testicular cancer]], as a hydrocele is soft and fluid-filled, whereas testicular cancer feels hard and rough.

===Fertility===
A hydrocele testis is not generally thought to affect fertility. However, it may be indicative of other factors that may affect fertility.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Cause==
During [[embryogenesis]], the [[testis]] descends through the [[inguinal canal]], drawing a diverticulum of [[peritoneum]] into the [[scrotum]] as it descends. This peritoneal tissue is known as the [[processus vaginalis]]. Normally, the communication between the processus vaginalis and the peritoneum is obliterated, and the [[tunica vaginalis]] is the tissue that remains overlying the testis and the [[epididymis]]. Congenital hydrocele results when the processus vaginalis remains patent, allowing fluid from the peritoneum to accumulate in the scrotum.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Ultrasound Scan ND 0124155309 1600360.png|thumb|Communicating hydrocele, caused by the failure of the [[processus vaginalis]] closure.]]
Through diagnostic [[ultrasound]] the accumulation of fluids can be diagnosed correctly.

==Treatment==
The fluid accumulation can be drained by [[Aspirator (medical device)|aspiration]], but this may be only temporary.  A more permanent alternative is a surgical procedure, generally, an outpatient ambulatory (same-day) procedure, called a hydrocelectomy. There are two surgical techniques available for hydrocelectomy.

; Hydrocelectomy with Excision of the Hydrocele Sac: Incision of the hydrocele sac after complete mobilization of the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving a margin of 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or ductus deferens. The edge of the hydrocele sac is oversewn for hemostasis ([[Ernst von Bergmann|von Bergmann]]'s technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). Hydrocele surgery with excision of the hydrocele sac is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles.
; Hydrocele Surgery with Plication of the Hydrocele Sac: The hydrocele is opened with a small skin incision without further preparation. The hydrocele sac is reduced (plicated) by suture Hydrocele surgery: Lord's technique. The plication technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the plication technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.&lt;ref&gt;Ku u.a. 2001 KU, J. H. ; KIM, M. E. ; LEE, N. K. ; PARK, Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic hygienical jurisprudence''' includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness during [[Salah|''salat'']] (obligatory prayer) through [[Wudu]] and [[Ghusl]], as well as [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic toilet etiquette|toilet etiquette]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. The ''fiqh'' is based on admonitions in the [[Qur'an]] for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in [[Hadith|hadith]] (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Qur'anic verses that teach how to achieve [[Ritual purification|ritual cleanliness]]. Keeping [[oral hygiene]] through cleaning the [[Tooth|teeth]] with the use of a form of [[toothbrush]] called [[miswak]] is considered [[sunnah]], the way of Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is also very important, as observed by the practices of [[wudu]] (partial ablution), [[ghusl]] (full ablution), and [[tayammum]] (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). 

In Muslim countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a [[Muslim shower]] situated next to the toilet, so that individuals may wash themselves properly. This [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness.  The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness.

==Islamic cleanliness and hygiene==
[[Sunni Islam]] has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunnah.com/urn/204970|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification  - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting [[eyebrow]]s is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible man can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunnah of Trimming Hair / Nails - ZIKR|url = http://www.zikr.co.uk/content/view/69/110/|website = www.zikr.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal grooming]] is also a matter of focus in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9037|title=Ruling on trimming hair|work=Islam QA|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing a [[beard]] to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as [[Fard|mandatory]] by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni [[Madh'hab]].

==Islamic dietary laws==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
'''Islamic dietary laws''' provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is '''[[halal|halāl]]''', meaning lawful. They are found in Qur'an, the holy book of [[Islam]], usually detailing what is unlawful, or '''[[haraam|harām]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims/|title=What is Halal? A Guide for Non-Muslims {{!}} Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|work=Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic genitalia hygiene==
Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is considered dirty. The [[foreskin]] is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. [[Circumcision]] is used to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/65|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic toilet etiquette==
{{Main|Islamic toilet etiquette}}
The [[Islam]]ic faith has particular rules regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code is known as ''Qadaahul Haajah''.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/surgeons-perform-delicate-operation-for-muslims-124083.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|title=Surgeons perform delicate operation for Muslims|date=April 8, 2007|author=Niamh Horan|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC|year=1992|title=The Tao of Islam|author=Sachiko Murata|isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8|chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6.

Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to:

* It is strongly forbidden to make the toilet close to the flowing waters, or to be by flowing water whilst relieving yourself.
* It is more preferable to step into the bathroom area with the left leg and step outside the bathroom area with the right leg.
* One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is heavily disliked.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* One should not face nor turn one's back on [[Qibla]] (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* When leaving the toilet one should also say a prayer, "O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* Use of [[toilet paper]] is acceptable, but [[Anal cleansing|washing with water]] is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Israr Hasan |year=2006 |title=Muslims in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k5J493fDF38C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;vq=odd |isbn=978-1-4259-4243-4 |page=144 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post is held by a [[physician]] who serves to advise and lead a team of public health professionals such as [[environmental health officer]]s and [[public health nurse]]s on matters of [[public health]] importance.

The equivalent senior health official at the national level is often referred to as the [[Chief Medical Officer]], although the title varies across countries, for example known as the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] in the United States and the [[Chief Public Health Officer of Canada|Chief Public Health Officer]] in Canada.

==Canada==

In Canada, all communities are under the jurisdiction of an MOH. The roles of the MOH vary across jurisdictions, but always include responsibilities related to public health and safety, and may include the following functions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php ''Role of the Medical Officer of Health.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101030321/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php |date=2012-01-01 }} Health Canada, accessed 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

*assessing environmental threats to human health; 
*providing leadership in public health emergency situations; 
*overseeing [[epidemiology|health surveillance]] activities; 
*providing expert advise on [[health promotion]] and disease prevention; 
*recommending and developing public [[health policy]].

==India==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
Health officers in India are expected to have prescribed qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Sanitary Science (B.S.Sc.), a degree of an institution recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]] or a diploma in Public Health after a 2-year study at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification No:22/2014 Health Officer in the Tamil Nadu Public Health Service, 2013-2014|url=http://www.tnpsc.gov.in/notifications/22_2014_not_eng_Health_Officer.pdf|publisher=TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION|accessdate=8 November 2015|pages=14|format=pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the municipal position was an elected head of the [[local board of health]], however the term MOH has also been used to refer to the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]]. Under the [[Metropolis Local Management Act 1855]], London municipalities were each required to appoint a medical officer. In 1856, 48 officers took up appointments in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Epidemic Streets: Infectious Disease and the Rise of Preventive Medicine | page = 4 | author = Anne Hardy | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-19-820377-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these specialists formed [[Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health]]. They were important and influential in the establishment of municipal hospitals under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1929]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levene|first1=Alysa|last2=Powell|first2=Martin|last3=Stewart|first3=John|title=The Development of Municipal General Hospitals in English County Boroughs in the 1930s|journal=Medical History|date=January 2006|volume=1|issue=50|pages=3–28|pmc=1369011|pmid=16502869|doi=10.1017/s002572730000942x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1974 NHS reorganisation they were replaced by Community Physicians who were attached to the different levels of the NHS.

'''Medical image sharing''' is the electronic exchange of medical images between hospitals, physicians and patients. Rather than using traditional media, such as a CD or DVD, and either shipping it out or having patients carry it with them, technology now allows for the sharing of these images using the cloud. The primary format for images is [[DICOM|DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)]]. Typically, non-image data such as reports may be attached in standard formats like [[Portable Document Format|PDF (Portable Document Format)]] during the sending process. Additionally, there are standards in the industry, such as [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing]] for Imaging (XDS-I), for managing the sharing of documents between healthcare enterprises. A typical architecture involved in setup is a locally installed server, which sits behind the firewall, allowing secure transmissions with outside facilities. In 2009, the [[Radiological Society of North America]] launched the "Image Share" project, with the goal of giving patients control of their imaging histories (reports and images) by allowing them to manage these records as they would online banking or shopping.&lt;ref name="rsna"&gt;{{cite web |title=RSNA Image Share Network Reaches First Patients |url=http://rsna.org/NewsDetail.aspx?id=2409 |publisher=Radiological Society of North America |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023053957/http://rsna.org/NewsDetail.aspx?id=2409 |archivedate=2013-10-23 |date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
* Care Facilities: Institutions use medical image sharing to facilitate transfers between other facilities that may or may not be on the same network. They are also able to instantly send results to referring physicians in the community, as well as directly to patients.&lt;ref name="collaboration"&gt;{{cite web |title=Factors Shaping Imaging's Future |url=http://www.imagingbiz.com/articles/imagingbiz/four-factors-shaping-imagings-future |website=ImagingBiz|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304184819/http://www.imagingbiz.com/topics/business/four-factors-shaping-imaging%E2%80%99s-future |archivedate=2016-03-04 |date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physicians: Doctors use the technology to have immediate access to images, as opposed to waiting for physical media to arrive. Having access to a patient's medical history improves the point of care service.&lt;ref name="access"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McNickle |first1=Michelle |title=Report: Get Patient Data Out Of Silos - InformationWeek |url=https://www.informationweek.com/interoperability/report-get-patient-data-out-of-silos/d/d-id/1106903 |website=InformationWeek |date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients: In conjunction with recent US government initiatives, patients are able to receive their imaging exams electronically, without needing to carry and store physical media. It allows for the ability to see physicians in multiple locations and have their imaging at the ready.&lt;ref name="patengagement"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pedulli |first1=Laura |title=Patient Engagement: The ‘Blockbuster Drug’ on Everyone’s Radar |url=https://www.clinical-innovation.com/topics/analytics-quality/patient-engagement-blockbuster-drug-everyones-radar |website=Clinical Innovation + Technology |accessdate=2018-09-02 |date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
* Improved access to patients’ medical imaging histories&lt;ref name="access"/&gt;
* Ability to view images instantly&lt;ref name="patientssharing"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Landro |first1=Laura |title=Image Sharing Seeks to Reduce Repeat Scans |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578396442302663234 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Real-time collaboration by specialists&lt;ref name="collaboration"/&gt;
* Avoiding duplicate care reduces costs&lt;ref name="costs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Benefits of Electronic Medical Records |url=http://www.healthcaredatasolutions.com/articles/top-5-benefits-of-electronic-medical-records.html|website=Healthcare Data Solutions|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628023534/http://www.healthcaredatasolutions.com/articles/top-5-benefits-of-electronic-medical-records.html |archive-date=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreased radiation exposure for patients&lt;ref name="patientssharing"/&gt;
* Expertise and specialized opinion is remotely accessible to patients&lt;ref name="patengagement"/&gt;

==Health 2.0==
Medical Image Sharing contributes to many of the "Health 2.0" initiatives across the industry. Being able to instantly and electronically exchange medical information can improve communication between physicians, as well as with patients.&lt;ref name="patientssharing"/&gt;
*'''Meaningful Use:''' The goal of meaningful use is to promote the spread of electronic health records to improve health care in the United States, which is to be rolled out in 3 stages through 2015. Some benefits of the initiative include better access to medical information and patient empowerment.&lt;ref name="meaningfuluse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy, Regulation and Strategy: Meaningful Use Meaningful Use |url=http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical image sharing helps achieve meaningful use by improving access to medical images to patients and physicians.
*'''Telehealth:''' The practice of delivering healthcare services utilizing telecommunication technologies is known as [[Telehealth]]. A major goal is to support long-distance health care for patients who are unable to easily travel to the point of care. Patients and professionals are also able to obtain further knowledge on health topics. As a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) promotes the use of telehealth technologies.&lt;ref name="telehealth"&gt;{{cite web |title=Telehealth |url=http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/about/telehealth/ |publisher=Health Resources and Services Administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425051350/http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/about/telehealth/ |archive-date=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing medical images over long distances can happen instantaneously with these technologies, allowing a physician to review a patient's images during the conference.
*'''Patient Engagement:''' Recent changes in the healthcare industry have placed more emphasis on empowering patients to control and have access to more of their medical information.&lt;ref name="patengagement"/&gt; The use of tools such as Electronic health records will help patients take a more active role in their health. With medical image sharing, patients can receive their medical imaging electronically, and then be able to share that information with the next physician they are seeing.&lt;ref name="telehealth"/&gt;
*'''Cloud Computing:''' Using software that is delivered as a service over the internet is referred to as [[Cloud computing]]. Typically, medical image sharing will be rolled out as a service for hospitals, clinicians and patients.
*'''Mobile:''' The use of mobile electronic devices has been rising across many industries, with healthcare included. As a physician, having access to medical images on the go is an important development in the field.&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratchinsky |first1=Karin |title=Africa Went Mobile, Hospitals Need to go Cloud |url=https://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/africa-went-mobile-hospitals-need-go-cloud |website=Healthcare IT News |accessdate=2018-09-02 |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
A typical architecture for a medical image sharing platform includes transmitting data from a system installed directly on the hospital network and behind the firewall, to and from an outside entity. Some of the standard architectural pieces involved include:
*[[Data transmission]] is the physical transfer of data through a communication channel, such as wires, wireless technologies or physical media. The most common use case for image sharing would be transmitting the image files using the cloud, allowing for instant access and exchange with anyone, anywhere. A [[Virtual private network]] (VPN) can be set up to enable exchange, but this is typically requires more to maintain for the facilities involved.
*[[Data Compression]] is used to help facilitate the exchange of large files by encoding using smaller bits than the original version. This process helps reduce the resources being used and improves the transmission capabilities. 
*Security: One widely utilized security tool is TSL/SSL, or [[Transport Layer Security]]. The Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSLv3) is used to secure electronic communications. TLS/SSLv3 helps to secure transmitted data using encryption. TLS/SSLv3 authenticates clients to prove the identities of parties engaged in secure communication, as well as authenticates servers. The TLS/SSLv3 security protocol can protect against data disclosure, masquerade attacks, bucket brigade attacks, rollback attacks, and replay attacks.
*Data Centers: A [[Data center]] is used to house computer systems and associated pieces. The main use of these facilities in medical image sharing is to provide backup. The infrastructure commonly includes redundant power, redundant generators, redundant Internet connections, redundant firewalls, redundant network switches, and redundant storage. This is a vital piece to ensure that medical images are safe and secure in the cloud.

==Integrations==
Image sharing platforms can integrate directly with many hospital systems, such as:
* [[Active Directory]] - Link to a hospital Active Directory for seamless use by staffed physicians.
* [[Picture archiving and communication system]] (PACS) - A medical imaging technology that provides economical storage of, and convenient access to, images from multiple modalities within a facility.
* [[Electronic medical record]] (EMR) - A computerized medical record created in an organization that delivers care, such as a hospital or physician's office.
* [[Vendor Neutral Archive]] (VNA) - A medical imaging technology in which images and documents (and potentially any file of clinical relevance) are stored (archived) in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems.
* [[Decision support system]] - A computer-based information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities.
* [[Health information exchange]] (HIE) - The mobilization of healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region, community or hospital system.
* [[Personal health record]] (PHR) - A health record where health data and information related to the care of a patient is maintained by the patient.

==Standards==
* [[DICOM]] - A standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging.
* [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing]] (XDS) - Focused on providing a standards-based specification for managing the sharing of documents between any healthcare enterprise, ranging from a private physician office to a clinic to an acute care in-patient facility and personal health record systems.
* [[Cross-enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging]] (XDS-I) - Extends XDS to share images, diagnostic reports and related information across a group of care sites. 
* HL7

==Privacy==
* [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) - Enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.&lt;ref name="hipaa"&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/ HIPAA Act].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Initiatives==
* HITECH Act: The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was instituted on February 17, 2009, in hopes of raising the overall meaningful use of health IT. It was created as a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It also addressed security and privacy issues related to electronic exchange of medical information.&lt;ref name="hitech"&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/enforcementrule/hitechenforcementifr.html HITECH Act Enforcement Interim Final Rule].&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Blue Button: A patient is provided with a highly visible, clickable button to download his or her medical records in digital form from a secure website offered by their doctors, insurers, pharmacies or other health-related service. People can log into this secure website to view and have the option to download their health information, so they can examine it, check it, and share it with their doctors and others as they see fit. The Blue Button download capability is a tool that can help individuals get access to their information so they can more effectively participate in and manage their health and health care. It is mainly being used by the Department of Veteran Affairs in the United States.&lt;ref name="bluebutton"&gt;[http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/ Blue Button Home].&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSNA Image Share Project==
RSNA Image Share is a network created to enable radiologists to share medical images with patients using personal health record (PHR) accounts. This pilot project, funded by the National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and administered by RSNA, began enrolling patients in 2011.&lt;ref name="rsna"/&gt;

Currently, there are five participating medical centers in the program - [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]], [[UCSF Medical Center]], [[University of Maryland Medical Center]], [[University of Chicago Medical Center]], and [[Mayo Clinic]]. Patients at these sites are able to receive and access their medical images electronically.&lt;ref name="rsna"/&gt; As of January 2017, there were seven software companies who have completed the RSNA Image Share Validation, Agfa Healthcare, [[Ambra Health]] (formerly DICOM Grid), [[GE Healthcare]], Lexmark Healthcare, [[LifeIMAGE|LifeImage, Inc.]], Mach7 Technologies and Novarad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rsna.org/News.aspx?id=21073|title=Seven Vendors Complete RSNA Image Share Validation Program|publisher=[[Radiological Society of North America]]
|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main architectural pieces to the project:
# A clearinghouse in the cloud
# An Edge Server at each local radiology site
# A PHR to receive the images and reports

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">A '''mental health consumer''' (or mental health patient) is a person who is obtaining treatment or support for a [[mental disorder]], also known as psychiatric or mental illness. The term was coined by people who use mental health services  in an attempt to empower those with [[mental health]] issues, usually considered a [[Marginalization|marginalized]] segment of society. The term suggests that there is a reciprocal contract between  those  who provide a service and those who use a service and that individuals have a choice in their treatment and that without them there could not exist [[mental health provider]]s.

==History==

In the 1970s the term "patient" was most commonly used.  Mental Health activists of the civil rights times recognized, as did many other groups seeking self-definition, that such labels are metaphors that reflect how identities are perceived and constructed (McDonald 206). In particular, in the mental health field they shape the nature of the relationship between the giver and receiver of psychiatric services, be it one with an emphasis on reciprocity or hierarchy (McLaughlin 2007). Users of psychiatric services repulsed the efforts of experts to define them and sought to develop ways to define themselves (Morrison 2000). In Australia, informal support groups of people who had recovered from episodes of mental ill health were formed during the first wave  of moving patients out of psychiatriic hospitals into the community in the 1960s. In the USA and other countries, radical movements to change service delivery and legislation began to be driven by consumers during the 1980s. Activists, such as Judi Chamberlain, pressed for alternatives to psychiatrist dominated and controlled systems of mental health provision. Chamberlain's On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System (Chamberlain 1978) helped guide others intent on a more collaborative form of mental health healing.

In the 1980s with some funding from NIMH, small experimental groups flourished. In 1985 at the  First Alternatives Conference attendees agreed upon the term "consumer" reflecting the patients' choice of services (Bluebird). The term also implied assumptions of rationality and ability to make choices in one's own best interests rather than be a passive incapacitated recipient of "expert" attention (McDonald 2006). 
In the 1990s many consumer groups were formed, such as Self Help Clearing House and the National Empowerment Center. They continued to press for more peer involvement in alternatives treatments, pointing out that peers support and comfort, in contrast to therapists who attempt to change the behavior and thinking patterns of consumers (Bluebird).

==Contemporary Usage==

Today, the word mental health consumer has expanded in the popular usage of consumers themselves to include anyone who has received mental health services in the past, anyone who has a behavioral health diagnosis, or simply anyone who has experienced a mental or behavioral disorder.  Other terms sometimes used  by members of this community  for empowerment through positive [[self-identification]] include "peers," "people with mental health disabilities," "psychiatric survivors," "users," individuals with "lived experience" and "ex-patients." (See the [[Psychiatric survivors movement]] for more information). The term "service users," is commonly used in the U.K. In the U.S. "consumer" is most frequently used by ex-patients and users of psychiatric and alternative services.

One can view this term, "consumer," neutrally as a person who receives psychological services, perhaps from a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a social worker. It can be impersonal term relating to the  use in the health sector of a large economy. It suggests that the consumer  expects to have some influence on service delivery and provides feedback 
to the provider.  Used in its more activist sense, consumer groups aim to correct perceived problems in mental health services and to promote consultation with consumers. Consumer theory was devised to interpret the special relationship between a service provider and service user in the context of mental health. Consumer theory examines the consequences and sociological meaning of the relationship.

{{Fats}}
In [[biochemistry]] and nutrition, '''monounsaturated fatty acids '''(abbreviated '''MUFAs''', or more plainly '''monounsaturated fats''') are [[fatty acids]] that have one [[double bond]] in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder [[carbon]] [[atom]]s being [[single bond|single-bonded]]. By contrast, [[polyunsaturated]] fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
[[Fatty acid]]s are long-chained [[molecule]]s having an [[alkyl]] group at one end and a [[carboxylic acid]] group at the other end. Fatty acid [[viscosity]] (thickness) and [[melting point|melting temperature]] increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than [[saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated resulting in a isotopic lattice structure.

Common monounsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]] (16:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7) and [[oleic acid]] (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;9). Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon [[cis-vaccenic acid]]. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a [[space-filling model]].

Monounsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more [[biological membrane|membrane]] fluidity than saturated fats, but they are more vulnerable to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low.&lt;ref&gt;

Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a [[palmitic acid]] diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kien CL, Bunn JY, Tompkins CL, Dumas JA, Crain KI, Ebenstein DB, Koves TR, Muoio DM | title = Substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure and with changes in mood | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–97 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23446891 | pmc = 3607650 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.051730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of [[oleic acid]] along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with [[breast cancer]] risk. The [[saturation index]] (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme [[delta-9 desaturase]] (Δ9-d).&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that the practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to a decreased risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]], overall [[cancer]] incidence, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], [[diabetes]], and [[mortality rate|early death]].&lt;ref name=Dinu2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinu|first1=M|last2=Pagliai|first2=G|last3=Casini|first3=A|last4=Sofi|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=10 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2017.58|pmid=28488692|volume=72|pages=30–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 review showed that the practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases, reduced total [[cost of living|costs of living]], and reduced costs for national [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name="martinez-lacoba2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Lacoba|first1=R|last2=Pardo-Garcia|first2=I|last3=Amo-Saus|first3=E|last4=Escribano-Sotos|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and health outcomes: a systematic meta-review.|journal=European Journal of Public Health|date= 2018|doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky113|pmid=29992229|volume=Advance articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9217">A '''notifiable disease''' is any disease that is required by law to be reported to government authorities. The collation of information allows the authorities to monitor the disease, and provides early warning of possible outbreaks. In the case of livestock diseases, there may also be the legal requirement to destroy the infected livestock upon notification. Many governments have enacted regulations for reporting of both human and animal (generally livestock) diseases. 

== Global ==

=== Human ===

The [[World Health Organization]]'s ''International Health Regulations 1969'' require disease reporting to the organization in order to help with its global surveillance and advisory role.  The current (1969) regulations are rather limited with a focus on reporting of three main diseases: [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]] and [[Plague (disease)|plague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/78e0e25cd4d14124cc256f0f0075dd1f?OpenDocument International Health Regulations Review - background]&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised ''International Health Regulations 2005'' broadens this scope and is no longer limited to the notification of specific diseases.  Whilst it does identify a number of specific diseases, it also defines a limited set of criteria to assist in deciding whether an event is notifiable to WHO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/ihr/en/ WHO | International Health Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/ihr/howtheywork/faq/en/index.html#how WHO | Frequently asked questions about the International Health Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) was established in 1990. Notifications are made to the States or Territory health authority and computerised, de-identified records are then supplied to the [[Department of Health and Ageing (Australia)|Department of Health and Ageing]] for collation, analysis and [http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/Source/CDA-index.cfm publication].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-surveil-nndss-nndssintro.htm Introduction to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System]&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda_surveil-nndss-dislist.htm Australian national notifiable diseases list and case definitions] are available online.

Notifications of both the disease and the distribution of specific medicine are made to a regional desk governmental agency called ''Agence régionale de santé'' by :

* Physician and Biologists, both in public or in private workplaces,
* Physician controllers ''(MISP)'' and Administratives civil-servant from ''Directions départementales des affaires sanitaires et sociales (DDASS''),
* Epidemiologists from the ''Institut de veille sanitaire (InVS),''
* Drugs sellers.

Anonymous records are then used by the government health-insurance system.

Ill people must cure them and in many case are put in quarantine.

{{main|UK statutory notification system}}
Requirement for the notification of infectious diseases originated near the end of the 19th century.  The list started with a few select diseases and has since grown to 31.  Currently disease notification for humans in the UK is regulated under the ''Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984'' and ''Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988''.  The governing body is Public Health England &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/topic/health-protection/infectious-diseases] | [General Information]&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england]

==== Children ====

There are also requirements for notification specific to children in the ''National standards for under 8s day care and childminding'' that state: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Office for Standards in Education]] should be notified of any food poisoning affecting two or more children looked after on the premises, any child having meningitis or the outbreak on the premises of any notifiable disease identified as such in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 or because the notification requirement has been applied to them by regulations (the relevant regulations are the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/noids/day_care.htm HPA | NOIDS | Day Care and Child Minding (National Standards)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal ===

In the UK notification of diseases in animals is regulated by the ''Animal Health Act 1981'', as well as the ''Specified Diseases (Notification and Slaughter) Order 1992 (as amended)'' and ''Specified Diseases (Notification) Order 1996 (as amended)''. The act states that a police constable should be notified, however in practice a [[Defra]] divisional veterinary manager is notified and Defra will investigate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/index.htm Defra, UK - Disease surveillance and control - Notifiable diseases]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, notifiable diseases in the [[United States]] varied according to the laws of individual states. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists]] (CSTE) also produced a list of nationally notifiable diseases that health officials should report to the [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/history.html History and Background | NNDSS]&lt;/ref&gt; A uniform criterion for reporting diseases to the NNDSS was introduced in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

==Background==
===Facts===

On December 10, 1943, a [[thyroidectomy]] was performed on petitioner's wife. A histological examination disclosed a [[Papillary thyroid cancer|papillary carcinoma of the thyroid]] with multiple lymph node metastases, according to the surgeon's report. During the taxable year the petitioner maintained his two children in day school during the first half of the year and in [[boarding school]] during the latter half of the year at a cost of $ 1,456.50. Petitioner deducted this sum from his income for the year 1946 as a medical expense under section 23(x) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].

During the taxable year, as a result of the operation on December 10, 1943, petitioner's wife was unable to speak above a whisper. Efforts of petitioner's wife to speak were painful, required much of her strength, and left her in a highly nervous state. Petitioner was advised by the operating surgeon that his wife suffered from cancer of the throat, a condition which was fatal in many cases. He advised extensive X-ray treatment after the operation. Petitioner became alarmed when, by 1946, his wife's voice had failed to improve, and believed that the irritation and nervousness caused by attempting to care for the children at a time when she could scarcely speak above a whisper might cause a recurrence of the cancer. Petitioner and his wife consulted a reputable physician and were advised by him that if the children were not separated from petitioner's wife she would not improve and her nervousness and irritation might cause a recurrence of the cancer. Petitioner continued to maintain his children in boarding school after the taxable year here involved until up to the end of five years following the operation of December 10, 1943, petitioner having been advised that if there was no recurrence of the cancer during that time his wife could be considered as having recovered from the cancer.

During the taxable year petitioner's income was between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000. Petitioner's two children have not attended private school but have lived at home and attended public school since a period beginning five years after the operation of December 10, 1943. Petitioner's purpose in sending the children to boarding school during the year 1946 was to alleviate his wife's pain and suffering in caring for the children by reason of her inability to speak above a whisper and to prevent a recurrence of the cancer which was responsible for the condition of her voice. He also thought it would be good for the children to be away from their mother as much as possible while she was unable to speak to them above a whisper.

Petitioner's wife was employed part of her time in 1946 as a typist and stenographer. On account of the impairment which existed in her voice she found it difficult to hold a position and was only able to do part-time work. At the time of the hearing of this proceeding in 1951, she had recovered the use of her voice and seems to have entirely recovered from her throat cancer.

===Issue===

The question raised by this appeal is whether the taxpayer Samuel Ochs was entitled under Section 213(x) of the Internal Revenue Code to deduct the sum of $ 1,456.50 paid by him for maintaining his two minor children in day school and boarding school as medical expenses incurred for the benefit of his wife.

===Tax court===

The Tax Court said in its opinion that it had no reason to doubt the good faith and truthfulness of the taxpayer and that his devotion and consideration for his wife were altogether admirable, but it nevertheless held that the expense of sending the children to school was not deductible as a medical expense under the provisions of Section 23(x) and the Treasury Regulations herein referred to.

Petitioner taxpayer sought review of the decision of the lower court, which held that expenses paid by petitioner for maintaining his two minor children in day school and boarding school were non-deductible family expenses within the meaning of 26 U.S.C.S. § 24(a)(1).

Following the lower court's decision that expenses incurred by petitioner taxpayer in sending his children to day and boarding school were non-deductible family expenses pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. § 24(a)(1), petitioner sought review. Petitioner argued that the purpose in sending the children to boarding school was to alleviate his wife's pain and suffering in caring for the children by reason of her inability to speak above a whisper and to prevent a recurrence of cancer. Petitioner argued that these expenses were therefore medical expenses, entitling him to a deduction.

==Opinion of the court==
The court rejected petitioner's argument and affirmed the decision. The court held that while it had no reason to doubt the good faith and truthfulness of petitioner and his reasons for incurring the expenses, the expenses incurred in sending the children to boarding school were nevertheless not deductible as medical expenses pursuant to the provisions of 26 U.S.C.S. § 23(x). The court held that the expenses were made necessary by the loss of the wife's services and that family expenditures could not be converted into deductible medical expenses.

The court affirmed the decision that held that expenses paid by petitioner taxpayer in connection with sending his children to boarding school were family expenditures and not deductible as medical expenses. The court held that these expenses were non-deductible family expenses because they were incurred as a result of the loss of the wife's services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31868">An '''orphan drug''' is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an [[orphan disease]].

The assignment of '''orphan status''' to a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in many countries and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have otherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug [[medical research|research and development]].&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

In the US and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, a time during which that company is the only one allowed to market the orphan drug—all intended to encourage the development of those drugs which might otherwise lack a sufficient [[profit motive]] and market to attract companies' research budgets and personnel.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |format=PDF |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly_2002" /&gt;

==Definition==
An orphan drug is a [[medication|pharmaceutical agent]] which has been developed to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as a [[rare disease]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A rare disease, also referred to as an "orphan disease", is any disease which affects a small percentage of the population. Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212325/http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} As many as one-in-ten Americans suffers from rare disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rare diseases' troubling questions |author=Andrew Duffy|newspaper=Cobourg Daily Star (Ontario) |date=25 January 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global statistics==
{{as of|2014}}, there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The US dominated the development of orphan drugs with more than 300 orphan drugs in clinical trial process, followed by Europe.

==Effect on investment, sales and profit==
According to [[Thomson Reuters]] in their 2012 publication "The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs," there has been increased investing in orphan drug research and development partly due to the U. S. [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]] (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world and also driven by "high-profile philanthropic funding."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs |work=Thomson Reuters |year=2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Laura Gaze, Jennifer Breen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513083426/http://thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/pharma-life-sciences/white-paper/1001450.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.drugdiscoverytoday.com/download/900 |title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |authors=Kiran N. Meeking, Cory S.M. Williams, John E. Arrowsmith |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005 |volume=17 |journal=Drug Discovery Today |pages=660–664 |pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the trade journal [[Drug Discovery Today]] between 2001 and 2011 was the "most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals."&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012" /&gt;{{rp|660}} For the same decade the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an "impressive 25.8 percent, compared to only 20.1 percent for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs."&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}} 
By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth USD$637 million compared to the USD$638 million matched control group of non-orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="ThomsonReuters_2012" /&gt;

By 2012,

{{quote|"the revenue-generating potential of orphan drugs [was] as great as for non-orphan drugs, even though patient populations for rare diseases are significantly smaller. Moreover, we suggest that orphan drugs have greater profitability when considered in the full context of developmental drivers including government financial incentives, smaller clinical trial sizes, shorter clinical trial times and higher rates of regulatory success."|Gaze and Breen 2012}}

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons: The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases —trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and little competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014"/&gt;

Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is "six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power". The cost of per-person outlays are huge and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at rapid rate. By 2020 the total was predicted to be $176 billion.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt; Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays have been the largest. There pressure on pharmaceuticals which "represent the biggest budgetary drain" has been predicted to increase particularly as more people with rare diseases will be eligible for subsidies —in the United States for example through the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

==Legislation==
Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], [[dosing]], stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a [[clinical trial|phase III clinical trial]], as fewer than that number may be afflicted with the disease in question.

Since the market for any drug with such a limited application scope would, by definition, be small and thus largely unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies, some governments have chosen to intervene to motivate a manufacturer to develop an orphan drug.&lt;ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" /&gt;

The intervention by government on behalf of orphan drug development can take a variety of forms:
* [[Tax incentive]]s
* Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights)

A 2015 study of "34 key Canadian stakeholders including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates"  investigated contributing factors to the growing interest of the pharmaceutical industry in "niche markets" such as orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="World_Medicine_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World Medicine Health Policy |date= 19 March 2015 |volume=7 |number=1 |pages= 3–27 |doi=10.1002/wmh3.131 |title=Why the Shift?

===United States===

The [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the [[United States]], with lobbying from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] and many other organizations,&lt;ref name=henkel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to encourage [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE4DF1F3EF933A05757C0A966958260 | title=Orphan Drug Law Spurs Debate | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=15 February 2009 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), "tax credits of up to 50% of R&amp;D costs, R&amp;D grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance&lt;ref name="Economically_viable_2012"/&gt;{{rp|660}} and may get clinical trial [[tax incentive]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits but it does not mean the drug is safe and effective and legal to manufacture and market in the United States.

In 2002, the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002|Rare Diseases Act]] was signed into law. It amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to establish the [[Office of Rare Diseases]]. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with [[rare diseases]].&lt;ref name="Law"/&gt;

===European Union===
In 2000, the [[European Union]] (EU) has enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as "orphan medicinal products". The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418 |title=Orphan disease definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2002-08-25 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerke|first=Sara|last2=Pattinson|first2=Shaun D.|date=2017-02-09|title=EU Marketing Authorisation of Orphan Medicinal Products and Its Impact on Related Research|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718093-12341439|journal=Brill|doi=10.1163/15718093-12341439|volume=24|pages=541–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's legislation is administered by the [[Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products]] of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).

In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes.&lt;ref name="BWN112007"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;{{cite news |title=ORPHAN DISEASES A RARE OCCURRENCE: A desperate search for help; County family joins long list with rare diseases in seeking a miracle |author=Andrew Duffy |newspaper=Windsor Star (Ontario) |date=23 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers of new drugs===
Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat [[glioma]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[phenylketonuria]], [[snake venom]] poisoning, and [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Pharmaceitical Executive opines, that the "ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success".&lt;ref name="Executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pharma's Orphans |author=Armstrong, Walter |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Executive |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before the [[United States Congress]] enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases.&lt;ref name="Daly_2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=House Offers Incentives For Development of 'Orphan' Drugs |author=Rich Daly |newspaper=Congressional Quarterly Daily Monitor |date=5 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, the Office of Orphan Products Development 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and granted 1,129 different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. 
From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. 
As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly  stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit of drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access to all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denis |first1=Alain |last2=Mergaert |first2=Lut |last3=Fostier |first3=Christel |last4=et al|title=Issues Surrounding Orphan Disease and Orphan Drug Policies in Europe |journal=Applied Health Economics and Health Policy |volume= 8 |issue=5 |pages=341 |doi=10.2165/11536990-000000000-00000|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not technically an orphan disease, the research and development into the treatment for [[AIDS]] has been heavily linked to the [[Orphan Drug Act]]. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to [[HIV]] infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arno|first=Peter S.|last2=Bonuck|first2=Karen|last3=Davis|first3=Michael|date=1995-01-01|title=Rare Diseases, Drug Development, and AIDS: The Impact of the Orphan Drug Act|jstor=3350258|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=73|issue=2|pages=231–252|doi=10.2307/3350258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples for selected diseases==

In the 1980s, people with [[cystic fibrosis]] rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like [[Pulmozyme]] and [[tobramycin]], both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Illingworth |first1=Patricia |last2=Cohen |first2=Jillian |last3=Illingworth |first3=P |year=2004 |title=Orphan Drug Policies: Implications for the United States, Canada, and Developing Countries |journal=Health Law Journal |volume=12 |pages=183–200|pmid=16539081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to  [[familial hypercholesterolemia]], which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of [[Statins|statin drugs]] which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

[[Penicillamine]] was developed to treat [[Wilson's disease]], a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt; [[Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate]] is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease.

==Activism, research centers==
The [[Center for Orphan Drug Research]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio-analysis.&lt;ref name="Technology"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating 25 Years of Orphan Drugs|author=Wechsler, Jill |newspaper=Pharmaceutical Technology |date=July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Keck Graduate Institute]] Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing.&lt;ref name="Technology"/&gt;

Numerous advocacy groups such as the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], [[Global Genes Project]], Children's Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of  patients suffering from rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that afflict children.&lt;ref name="Executive"/&gt;

==Cost==
According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EvaluatePharma Orphan Drug Report 2015| last=Hadjivasiliou| first=Andreas| publisher=EvaulatePharma| year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of [[Spinraza]] (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Costly Drug for Fatal Muscular Disease Wins F.D.A. Approval|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/business/spinraza-price.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=New York Times|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1750-1172-6-62?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com|title=Estimating the budget impact of orphan medicines in Europe: 2010 - 2020|author=Carina Schey , Tsveta Milanova and Adam Hutchings|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|year=2011|volume=6|issue=62|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs.&lt;ref name=meek&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Meekings| first=Kiran N.|last2=Williams |first2=Cory S. M. |last3=Arrowsmith |first3=John E.| date=2012-07-01|title=Orphan drug development: an economically viable strategy for biopharma R&amp;D| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644612000529|journal=Drug Discovery Today| volume=17| issue=13–14| pages=660–664|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.02.005|pmid=22366309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesselheim AS|last2=Myers JA|last3=Avorn J|date=2011-06-08|title=CHaracteristics of clinical trials to support approval of orphan vs nonorphan drugs for cancer|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.769|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=22|pages=2320–2326|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.769|issn=0098-7484|pmid=21642684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt; The subsidies can total up to 30 million dollars per fiscal year in the United States alone {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as [[eculizumab]], was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.&lt;ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=How pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drug: Cost of one of world's most expensive drugs shrouded in corporate secrecy |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |first=Kelly |last=Crowe |work=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces."|Sachdev Sidhu 2015}}

==Public-funding==
===Evaluation criteria===
By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public-funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007"&gt;{{citation |authors=Drummond MF, Grubert N. |title=International Trends in the Use of Health Economic Data |location=Waltham MA |series=Spectrum Report, Decision Resources |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QALY has often been used in [[cost-utility analysis]] to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention.&lt;ref name="NICE_2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp | title=Measuring effectiveness and cost effectiveness: the QALY | publisher=NICE | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg9/chapter/6-the-appraisal-of-the-evidence-and-structured-decision-making | title=Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013 | publisher=NICE | date=2013 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of £20,000–£30,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008"&gt;{{citation |title=Challenges in the economic evaluation of orphan drugs |first=Michael F |last=Drummond |publisher=World Health Organization |journal=Eurohealth |volume=14 |number= 2 |pages= 16–257 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs.&lt;ref name="Drummond_2007" /&gt; By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds "well in excess of the ‘accepted’ level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria."&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt; As early as 2005 McCabe et al argued&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=McCabe C, Claxton K, Tsuchiya A. |title=Orphan drugs and the NHS |journal=British Medical Journal |year=2005 |volume=331 |pages=1016–19 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |authors=McCabe C, Tsuchiya A, Claxton K, Raftery J.|title= Assessing the economic challenges posed by orphan drugs: a comment on Drummond et al. |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |year=2007 |volume=23 |number=3 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1017/s0266462307071012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond et al&lt;ref name="McCabe_2007" /&gt; argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along than the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

===Abuse potential===
[[File:Rosuvastatin-Formulae V 1.png|thumb|Rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor) is an example of a drug that received Orphan Drug funding but was later marketed to a large consumer base.]]
The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simoens|first=Steven|date=2011-06-17|title=Pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs: the need for more transparency|url=http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|journal= Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-42|pmc=3132155|pmid=21682893|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their [[profit margin]]. For example [[AstraZeneca]]'s cholesterol drug [[Rosuvastatin|Crestor]] was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric [[familial hypercholesterolemia]]. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.&lt;ref name="Windsor"/&gt;

===NICE===

By 2008 if an orphan drug cost more than £30,000{{clarify|reason=30k per patient? For total cost of treatment? Per some time period?|date=July 2015}} the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] required other arguments for funding.&lt;ref name="Eurohealth_2008" /&gt;

In 2015, NICE held consultations with "patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers" regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies. There was a call for more research into new processes including the &lt;ref name="NICE_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=NICE calls for a new approach to managing the entry of drugs into the NHS |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/nice-calls-for-a-new-approach-to-managing-the-entry-of-drugs-into-the-nhs |date= 18 September 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2015 |work=NICE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Program Snapshot|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/promis|work=National Institutes of Health Common fund|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''PROMIS''') provides clinicians and researchers access to reliable, valid, and flexible measures of health status that assess physical, mental, and social well–being from the patient perspective. PROMIS measures are standardized, allowing for assessment of many patient-reported outcome domains—including pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical functioning and social role participation—based on common metrics that allow for comparisons across domains, across chronic diseases, and with the general population. Further, PROMIS tools allow for computer adaptive testing, efficiently achieving precise measurement of health status domains with few items. There are PROMIS measures for both adults and children. PROMIS was established in 2004 with funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as one of the initiatives of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH PROMIS Roadmap |url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |work=NIH Commonfund |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217072814/https://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |archivedate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
The NIH established the Roadmap for Medical Research in 2004 to identify major opportunities for medical research and the development of new scientific expertise and technology that would lead to tangible benefits for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH PROMIS History|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the programs within the Roadmap, Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise, called for developing rigorous and systematic infrastructure for clinical research and for translating scientific discoveries into practical applications or tools that can be used by healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The NIH Roadmap: Re-Engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise |publisher = National Institutes of Health | url = http://or.org/pdf/NIH_Roadmap-ClinicalResearch.pdf| series=NIH Backgrounder |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROMIS is one initiative within this program.
The PROMIS initiative develops and evaluates standard measures for key patient-reported health indicators and symptoms.&lt;ref name=Progress-2007&gt;{{cite journal|first1=David |last1=Cella |first2=Susan |last2=Yount |first3=Nan |last3=Rothrock |first4=Richard |last4=Gershon |first5=Karon |last5=Cook |first6=Bryce |last6=Reeve |first7=Deborah |last7=Ader |first8=James F. |last8=Fries |first9=Bonnie |last9=Bruce |first10=Mattias |last10=Rose |author11=PROMIS Cooperative Group|title=The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS): Progress of an NIH Roadmap Cooperative Group During its First Two Years|journal=Medical Care|date=May 2007|volume=45|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S3-S11|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000258615.42478.55|pmid=17443116|pmc=2829758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient-reported measures such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, and physical functioning complement clinical measures (e.g., x-rays and lab tests) by providing healthcare providers with information about what patients are able to do and how they feel.&lt;ref name=developing_ader&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ader|first=Deborah N.|title=Developing the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)|journal=Medical Care|date=May 2007|volume=45|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S1-S2|url=http://uwcorr.washington.edu/publications/developing_ader.pdf|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000260537.45076.74|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215635/http://uwcorr.washington.edu/publications/developing_ader.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PROMIS has worked to unify the field of [[patient-reported outcome]] (PRO) measurement through the promotion of a common, systematic measurement system broadly applicable across clinical research. PROMIS measures are intended to assess the most common or salient dimensions of patient–relevant outcomes for the widest possible range of chronic disorders and diseases, thus they are "generic" measures vs. specific to given disease or condition. Structured as a multi-institutional collaboration with NIH, PROMIS has advanced the consensus process within the field of PRO measurement through the involvement of the funded research collaborative in establishing a rigorous, systematic infrastructure for measure development and psychometric evaluation.&lt;ref name=developing_ader /&gt;

PROMIS takes advantage of developments in technology, as well as advances in the sciences of psychometric, qualitative, cognitive, and health survey research, to create new models and methods for collecting PROs for use in clinical research and evaluation of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS: Clinical Outcomes Assessment - Overview|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/promis/overview.aspx|work=NIH Common Fund|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROMIS incorporates and translates cutting-edge science into practical, easy to use tools for clinicians: For example, PROMIS implements [[Computerized adaptive testing|Computer Adaptive Test]] (CAT) software which tailors the PRO assessment to the individual patient by selecting the most informative set of questions based on responses to previous questions. CAT questionnaires allow an accurate measurement of health status using the fewest possible questions.

==Assessment and expansion==

In November 2012, the PROMIS network held it first international strategy meeting with organizational partners from 8 European countries, China and Canada to develop a strategic action plan for the international spread of PROMIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research/promis-international | title = Summary | date = 2 November 2016 | conference = PROMIS International Strategy Session | location = University of Pennsylvania &amp; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, PROMIS unveiled new materials to expand its outreach to researchers and clinicians: the PROMIS e-newsletter and two instructional videos series about PROMIS and Item Response Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conceptual Introduction to Item Response Theory|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an updated PROMIS website at www.HealthMeasures.net was created to provide more information about measure selection, data collection tools, score calculation, score interpretation, item response theory, and support an online forum for posting questions to the PROMIS user community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Website|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis|accessdate= 2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliates==
The PROMIS initiative is fulfilled by a network of primary research sites and coordinating centers that collaborate to develop the items and tools to measure PROs, and to evaluate the reliability and validity of these measures.&lt;ref name=Progress-2007 /&gt;
Between 2004 and 2009, PROMIS consisted of a Statistical Coordinating Center, located at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, and six research sites located at Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Pittsburgh, Stanford University, Stony Brook University, and University of Washington. In 2010, NIH renewed funding for PROMIS and expanded the program to six additional research sites: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Boston University / University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; University of California, Los Angeles; Georgetown University; Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati; and University of Maryland, Baltimore. PROMIS also added a Network Center, operated by the American Institutes for Research, Washington DC as well as a Statistical Center and a Technology Center, both operated by Northwestern University. These centers provided logistical and technical support to PROMIS. 

In September 2014, the NIH extended its support to PROMIS through funding the National Person Centered Assessment Resource (PCAR/HealthMeasures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Person Centered Assessment Resource Grant|url=https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9136083&amp;icde=31756423&amp;ddparam=&amp;ddvalue=&amp;ddsub=&amp;cr=1&amp;csb=default&amp;cs=ASC|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other measurement systems, Quality of Life in Neurologic Disorders (Neuro-QoL), Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement system (ASCQ-Me), and the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIH Toolbox) are also supported through HealthMeasures. HealthMeasures aims to facilitate the dissemination, implementation, and self-sustainability of these four measurement systems. The HealthMeasures grant was awarded to Northwestern University with additional sites at American Institutes for Research, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Diego, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and University of Pittsburgh.

==Mission==
PROMIS uses measurement science to create a state-of-the-science assessment system for self–reported health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Mission, Vision &amp; Goals|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Create and promulgate a set of qualitative and quantitative methodological standards for development and validation of PROMIS instruments.
* Launch a sustainable entity that is able to continue and grow the research, development, and dissemination activities for the network.
* Identify and prioritize a set of research and development opportunities for PROMIS that include, but are not limited to, clinical applications.
* Disseminate information on PROMIS to forge strategic alliances with key individuals and organizations that that will help PROMIS fulfill its vision and enhance its adoption in research, clinical practice, and policy.

==Measures==
PROMIS has self-reported health measures in the domains of physical health, mental health and social health for adult self-reported and pediatric-self and proxy-reported health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Domains|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/intro-to-promis|work=PROMIS website|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patient education''' is the process by which [[health professional]]s and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|title=iv. Patient Education and Counseling for Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064558/http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training.

[[Health education]] is also a tool used by [[managed care]] plans, and may include both general [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] education or [[health promotion]] and disease or condition specific education.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved.It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. 

The value of patient education can be summarized as follows:
*Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability.
*Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition.
*Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them.
*Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply.
*Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications.
*Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need.
*Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits.
*Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krames.com Krames Patient Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient-education.com/?p=editorial&amp;s=xplainresearch&amp;ver=~2 Patient Education Institute, Research evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competencies of a [[health educator]] include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastable|first=Susan B.|title=Health Professionals as Educator|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Learning, LLC|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others.
*Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care.
*Practice preventative health care.
*Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families.
*Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care.
*Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society.
*Use technology appropriately and effectively.
*Be current in the field and continue to advance education.
There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment.
* For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantera|first=E.|last2=Pourtier-Piotte|first2=C.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=L.|last4=Coudeyre|first4=E.|title=Patient education after amputation: Systematic review and experts’ opinions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877065714000165|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=143–158|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving  overall patient health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zangi|first=Heidi A.|last2=Ndosi|first2=Mwidimi|last3=Adams|first3=Jo|last4=Andersen|first4=Lena|last5=Bode|first5=Christina|last6=Boström|first6=Carina|last7=Eijk-Hustings|first7=Yvonne van|last8=Gossec|first8=Laure|last9=Korandová|first9=Jana|date=2015-06-01|title=EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/954|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=954–962|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206807|issn=1468-2060|pmid=25735643}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], patient education has been shown as an effective non-pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brosseau|first=Lucie|last2=Rahman|first2=Prinon|last3=Poitras|first3=Stéphane|last4=Toupin-April|first4=Karine|last5=Paterson|first5=Gail|last6=Smith|first6=Christine|last7=King|first7=Judy|last8=Casimiro|first8=Lynn|last9=Angelis|first9=Gino De|title=A Systematic Critical Appraisal of Non-Pharmacological Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis with Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095369|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095369|pmc=4026323|pmid=24840205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21797">'''Pelvic girdle pain''' (abbreviated '''PGP''') is a [[Symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy|pregnancy discomfort]] that causes [[Chronic pain|pain]], instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP has a long history of recognition, mentioned by [[Hippocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owens Kelly, Pearson Anne, Mason Gerald | year = 2002 | title = Pubic Symphysis Separation | url = | journal = Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 141–155 | doi=10.2017/s0965539502000244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in medical literature by Snelling.&lt;ref name=childbearing&gt;Pain In Childbearing, Key Issues In Management, Margaret Yerby, Lesley Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Prior to the 20th century, specialists of pregnancy-related PGP used varying terminologies. It is now referred to as Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain that may incorporate the following conditions:

* [[Diastasis symphysis pubis|Diastasis of the Symphysis Pubis]](DSP)
* [[Symphysis pubis dysfunction]](SPD)
* Pelvic Joint Syndrome
* Physiological Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Symptom Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Posterior Pelvic Pain
* Pelvic Arthropathy
* Inferior Pubic Shear/ Superior Pubic Shear /Symphyseal Shear
* Symphysiolysis
* [[Osteitis pubis]] (usually postpartum)
* [[Sacroiliac joint|Sacroiliitis]]
* One-sided Sacroiliac Syndrome /Double Sided Sacroiliac Syndrome
* [[Hypermobility (joints)|Hypermobility]]

''"The classification between hormonal and mechanical pelvic girdle instability is no longer used. For treatment and/or prognosis it makes no difference whether the complaints started during pregnancy or after childbirth." Mens (2005)''&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;About Pelvic Girdle Instability. Definition and Concept. Jan M.A. Mens.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
A combination of postural changes,baby, unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones, and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of the thighs (opening too wide too quickly) or an action that has strained the joint.

PGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the [[Symphysis|symphyseal joint]], and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the [[hips]], [[groin]] and [[abdomen|lower abdomen]] and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.

During pregnancy and [[postpartum]], the symphyseal gap can be felt moving or straining when walking, climbing stairs or turning over in bed; these activities can be difficult or even impossible. The pain may remain static, e.g., in one place such as the front of the pelvis, producing the feeling of having been kicked; in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas. It is also possible that a woman may experience a combination of symptoms.

Any weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis, producing symptoms that may limit the ability of the woman to carry out many daily activities. She may experience pain involving movements such as dressing, getting in and out of the bath, rolling in bed, climbing the stairs or sexual activity. Pain may also be present when lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling.

The symptoms (and their severity) experienced by women with PGP vary, but include:

* Present swelling and/or inflammation over joint.
* Difficulty lifting leg.
* Pain pulling legs apart.
* Inability to stand on one leg.
* Inability to transfer weight through pelvis and legs.
* Pain in hips and/or restriction of hip movement.
* Transferred nerve pain down leg.
* Can be associated with bladder and/or bowel dysfunction.
* A feeling of the symphysis pubis giving way.
* Stooped back when standing.
* Malalignment of pelvic and/or back joints.
* Struggle to sit or stand.
* Pain may also radiate down the inner thighs.
* Waddling or shuffling gait.
* Audible ‘clicking’ sound coming from the pelvis.

===Severity===
The severity and instability of the pelvis can be measured on a three level scale.

'''Pelvic type 1:'''The pelvic ligaments support the pelvis sufficiently. Even when the
muscles are used incorrectly, no complaints will occur when performing everyday activities. This is the most common situation in persons who have never been pregnant, who have never been in an accident, and who are not hypermobile.''

'''Pelvic type 2:'''The ligaments alone do not support the joint sufficiently. A
coordinated use of muscles around the joint will compensate for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This type often occurs after giving birth to a child weighing 3000&amp;nbsp;grams or more, in cases of hypermobility, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 is the most common form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.

'''Pelvic type 3:'''The ligaments do not support the joint sufficiently. This is a serious
situation whereby the muscles around the joint are unable to compensate for ligament weakness. This type of pelvic instability usually only occurs after an accident, or occasionally after a (small) accident in combination with giving birth. Sometimes a small accident occurring long before giving birth is forgotten so that the pelvic instability is attributed only to the childbirth. Although the difference between Type 2 and 3 is often difficult to establish, in case of doubt an exercise program may help the patient. However, if Pelvic Type 3 has been diagnosed then invasive treatment is the only option: in this case parts of the pelvis are screwed together. (Mens 2005)&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Psychosocial impact===
PGP in pregnancy seriously interferes with participation in society and activities of daily life; the average sick leave due to posterior pelvic pain during pregnancy is 7 to 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Noren Lotta RPT |author2=Ostgaard Solveig |author3=Nielsen Thorkild F |author4=Ostgaard Hans C | year = 1997 | title = Reduction of Sick Leave for Lumbar Back and Posterior Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 22 | issue = 18| pages = 2157–2160 | doi=10.1097/00007632-199709150-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases women with PGP may also experience emotional problems such as anxiety over the cause of pain, resentment, anger, lack of self-esteem, frustration and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; she is three times more likely to suffer [[Postpartum depression|postpartum depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gutke A, Josefsson A, Oberg B | date = Jun 2007 | title = Pelvic girdle pain and lumbar pain in relation to postpartum depressive symptoms | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 32 | issue = 13| pages = 1430–6 | doi=10.1097/brs.0b013e318060a673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert HB, Godskesen M, Korsholm L, Westergaard JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk factors in developing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 539–44 | doi=10.1080/00016340600578415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sometimes there is no obvious explanation for the cause of PGP but usually there is a combination of factors such as:

# The pelvic joints moving unevenly.
# A change in the activity of the muscles in the pelvis, [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]], abdomen, back and [[pelvic floor]].
# A history of pelvic trauma.

==Mechanism==
Pregnancy related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) can be either specific (trauma or injury to pelvic joints or genetical i.e. [[connective tissue disease]]) and non-specific. PGP disorder is complex and multi-factorial and likely to be also represented by a series of sub-groups driven by pain varying from [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] or [[central nervous system]],&lt;ref&gt;Diagnosis and classification of pelvic girdle pain disorders—Part 1: A mechanism based approach within a biopsychosocial framework Manual Therapy, Volume 12, Issue 2, May 2007, Peter B.

[[Pregnancy]] begins the [[Physiology|physiological changes]] through a pattern of hormonal secretion and [[signal transduction]] thus initiating the remodelling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Over time, the ligaments could be stretched either by injury or excess strain and in turn may cause PGP.

=== Anatomy===
The [[pelvis]] is the largest bony part of the [[skeleton]] and contains three joints: the [[pubic symphysis]], and [[sacroiliac joint|two sacroiliac joints]]. A highly durable network of [[ligament]]s surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.

The pubic symphysis has a [[Fibrocartilage| fibrocartilage joint]] which may contain a fluid filled cavity and is [[avascular]]; it is supported by the [[Superior pubic ligament|superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ligament|arcuate ligaments]]. The sacroiliac joints are [[Synovial fluid|synovial]], but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;SPD: The Clinical Presentation, Prevalence, Aetiology, Risk Factors and Morbidity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Relaxin hormone===
[[Relaxin]] is a [[hormone]] produced mainly by the [[corpus luteum]] of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy it is also produced by the [[placenta]], [[chorion]], and [[decidua]]. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of [[collagen]] thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, [[tendon]]s, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.

Although relaxin's main cellular action in pregnancy is to remodel collagen by [[biosynthesis]] (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) it does not seem to generate musculoskeletal problems. European Research has determined that relaxin levels are not a predictor of PGP during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petersen LK, Hvidman L, Uldbjerg N | year = 1994 | title = Normal Serum Relaxin in Women with Disabling Pelvic Pain During Pregnancy | url = | journal = Gynecol Obstet Invest | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 21–3 | doi=10.1159/000292438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Björklund K, Bergström S, Nordström ML, Ulmsten U | date = Apr 2000 | title = Symphyseal Distention in Relation to Serum Relaxin Levels and Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 269–75 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0412.2000.079004269.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hansen A, Jensen DV, Larsen E, Wilken-Jensen C, Petersen LK | date = Mar 1996 | title = Relaxin is not related to symptom-giving pelvic girdle relaxation in pregnant women | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 245–9 | doi=10.3109/00016349609047095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert H, Godskesen M, Westergaard JG, Chard T, Gunn L | date = Jul 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. | volume = 74 | issue = 1| pages = 19–22 | doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gait changes===
The pregnant woman has a different pattern of "[[Gait analysis|gait]]". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain and changes in posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to the rotation of the hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.

During the motion of walking, an upward movement of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy there may be an increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and [[Ankle|ankle plantar flexor muscles]] during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short stance phase and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called [[Gait abnormality|Antalgic Gait]].

==Treatment==
A number of treatments have some evidence for benefits include an exercise program.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) has not been found effective but is safe.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[NSAID]]s are sometimes effective but should not be used after 30 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; There is tentative evidence for [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name=Ver2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstraete|first1=EH|last2=Vanderstraeten|first2=G|last3=Parewijck|first3=W|title=Pelvic Girdle Pain during or after Pregnancy: a review of recent evidence and a clinical care path proposal.|journal=Facts, views &amp; vision in ObGyn|date=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–43|pmid=24753927|pmc=3987347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pelvic joint trauma will not respond to conservative type treatments and [[orthopedic surgery]] might become the only option to stabilize the joints.

==Prognosis and epidemiology==
For most women, PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for [[weight bearing]] activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Larsen EC, Wilken-Jensen C, Hansen A, Jensen DV, Johansen S, Minck H, Wormslev M, Davidsen M, Hansen TM | date = Feb 1999 | title = Symptom-Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation in Pregnancy.

Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Dieën, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C.

{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') refers to protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others.

The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }} Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;
impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.

Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.

==Types==
[[File:Die Bienenzüchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]

Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|first1=Jos H|last2=Ijaz|first2=Sharea|last3=Mischke|first3=Christina|last4=Ruotsalainen|first4=Jani H|last5=Mäkelä|first5=Erja|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Edmond|first7=Michael B|last8=Sauni|first8=Riitta|last9=Kilinc Balci|first9=F Selcen|last10=Mihalache|first10=Raluca C|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27093058|volume=4|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respirators===
{{main article|Respirator}}
[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|Air-purifying respirator]]

Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.&lt;ref name=resp&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830084012/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ |date=2012-08-30 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration may be either passive or [[Powered, air-purifying respirator|active (powered)]]. [[Gas mask]]s and [[respirator|particulate respirators]] are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name =resp/&gt; In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]]. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), [[NHS Health Scotland]] and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as "dos and don'ts" for each type.&lt;ref name=rpe&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/rpe-selector/ "Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job"]. Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt; [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928092148/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html |date=2017-09-28 }}.

===Skin protection===
[[File:Worker weighing carbon nanotubes.png|alt=A man wearing a white lab coat reaches over a beaker containing white powder on a balance|thumb|A worker wearing a [[respirator]], [[lab coat]], and [[Medical glove|gloves]] while weighing [[carbon nanotube]]s]]
[[File:Incorrect use of personal protective equipment.png|alt=A closeup of a person's arm requing into a bucket filled with a black material|thumb|This is an incorrect use of personal protective equipment, because the gap between the [[Medical glove|glove]] and the [[lab coat]] exposes the wrist to hazardous materials.]]
Occupational skin diseases such as [[contact dermatitis]], [[skin cancer]]s, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806040459/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ |date=2012-08-06 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.

Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.

===Eye protection===
{{Main|Eye protection}}
[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]

Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt; Smaller particles in [[smoke]]s and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as [[welding]] torches and [[ultraviolet|UV light]], also contribute to occupational eye injury.&lt;ref name="eyesafe"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902212409/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html |date=2017-09-02 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Goggles]] provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt; Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Face shield]]s provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;

===Hearing protection===
{{Main article|Hearing protection}}
[[Industrial noise]] is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.&lt;ref name="noise"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703145248/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html |date=2016-07-03 }}. The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes occupational noise exposure standards.&lt;ref name="oshanoise"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402213424/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 |date=2015-04-02 }}. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85&amp;nbsp;dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202172749/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}.  DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPE for hearing protection consists of [[earplugs]] and [[earmuffs]]. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention.

===Protective clothing and ensembles===
{{See also|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}
[[File:Regal mit Persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.jpg|thumb|upright|Locker containing personal protective equipment]][[Image:High-Pressure-Cleaning-with-Personal-Protective-Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|A complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work]]

This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and [[ballistic vest]]s worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.

====Ensembles====
Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user.
* [[Chainsaw]] [[chainsaw safety clothing|protection]] (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, [[kevlar]] [[chaps]], anti-vibration gloves, and [[Chainsaw safety clothing#Boots|chainsaw safety boots]]).
* [[Beekeeping|Bee-keepers]] wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.
* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].
* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include [[bunker gear]], [[self-contained breathing apparatus]], a [[helmet]], [[steel-toe boot|safety boots]], and a [[PASS device]].

====In sports====
{{Main|Protective gear in sports}}
Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on [[National Football League|NFL]] players,&lt;ref name=brainnfl&gt;[http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121220112221/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ |date=2012-12-20 }}.

==Limits of the definition==
[[File:Safetyequipment3030.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place.]]
The definition of what constitutes as personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against [[Hustler]] and other adult film production companies by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]], leading to several citations brought by [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Cal/OSHA]].&lt;ref name=hustler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|title=Larry Flynt’s Hustler Video Cited by Cal/OSHA over Condoms, Safety, Says AHF|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806224124/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to use [[condom]]s by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment.&lt;ref name=hustler/&gt; This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.

==Legislation in the European Union==
At the [[European Union]] level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‘any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].

Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:
* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)
* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)
* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)

Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.

Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.

Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:
* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;
* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);
* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;
* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;
* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.

The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.

'''PositiveSingles''' is a free friendship, social and [[dating website]] that specifically caters to people who are living with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online dating for people with sexually transmitted infections|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21955126|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PositiveSingles.com Is A Niche Dating Site That Actually Makes Sense|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/positive-singles-std-stigma-love_n_4214524.html|website=HuffingtonPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its services are mainly provided in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 and its headquarters are in [[Vaughan, Ontario]]. The company is privately held.

== Overview ==
Launched in [[Mountain View, California]] in 2001, PositiveSingles claims to be "The best, largest, completely anonymous and most trusted online dating site for people with [[Herpes]], [[HPV]], [[HIV]] / [[AIDS]], [[Hepatitis]], [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[Gonorrhea]], [[Syphilis]] and other STD" on its homepage.

The slogan of PositiveSingles is "''Stay Positive! Find Love, Support &amp; Hope''" in contrast to its previous slogan "''We Are Not Alone!''"

== History ==
PositiveSingles was founded in 2001 as a free STD dating site. Membership was divided into guest and gold membership a year later.

In 2007, STD Q &amp; A (live counselor) was added on PositiveSingles, where every member can anonymously (if they choose to) ask questions about STDs and STD counselor will reply to each one. Members can put forward their own advice as well. Any information provided by users will be kept confidential.

In July, 2010, PositiveSingles added a feature named STD Legal Information. This feature was made on account of the particularity of the special group. PositiveSingles members can obtain legal information regarding their STD status as well as learn how to protect themselves from legal encounters.

In 2012, PositiveSingles launched its apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, which provide full functionality as the website.

== Pricing model ==
PositiveSingles charges no fee when users register, search or browse profiles, send winks to another user. However, gold membership (i.e., paid) is required to use some of its premium features.

'''Private healthcare''' or '''private medicine''' is [[healthcare]] and [[medicine]] provided by entities other than the government. 

Ethical issues relating to private healthcare primarily concerns the argument that the seriously ill be entitled to spend money on saving their lives. On the other hand, private healthcare can sometimes be more efficient than public sector provision. Private operators may be more innovative in areas such as telemedicine. Due to the [[profit motive]], they can be more productive. The friendly behavior of staff and doctors are the main reason for people relying on private health care centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/friendly-service-modern-facilities-draw-people-to-private-healthcare-centres/article18734394.ece|title=Friendly service, modern facilities draw people to private healthcare centres|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charging patients or private insurers for work==
Europeans in all countries are willing to pay a charge for some private healthcare, whether to avoid long queues, to access cosmetic surgery, or to avoid the perceived risk of infection in public-sector hospitals. This is not a small market. In Finland, it is estimated that it is worth some €700m a year. In Greece, half the income of private hospitals is from one-off payments from patients. Maternity is a particularly large private market, as it is the demand for fertility both at home and abroad, where more than 18% of medical internet-based searches are related to infertility conditions and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allprivatehealth.com/&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare tourism is also thriving within the EU, in which patients (mainly from the UK) travel to Eastern Europe for low-cost dental work. The particularly wealthy Russians and Saudi Arabians tend to go to private hospitals in Switzerland or Germany.

As most Europeans have access to public sector provision either through their mandatory social insurance fund or through taxes, private healthcare insurance remains a relatively small market, with levels typically in the range of 2–8% of the population {{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. Many consumers prefer to pay single fees as and when necessary. In addition, any occupational healthcare paid for by employers renders private healthcare insurance unnecessary. Nonetheless, around 10% of Germans have some form of private healthcare insurance which enables them to experience a slightly higher level of comfort during hospital stays{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. The most notable development in this area has been the Netherlands, which in 2005 moved to a system whereby all citizens are forced to take out private healthcare insurance rather than social insurance{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2016}}. This is being closely monitored by many European countries.

==Occupational healthcare==
In many European countries with a state-run national health service, employers are obliged to pay for some level of healthcare for their employees. This is the case in Romania, Poland, and Finland, for instance, and one can find networks of small clinics in large cities in these countries. In other countries, such as the UK and Sweden, many employers are willing to pay for occupational healthcare for their workforce so that key workers can avoid delays in seeing a doctor when they are unwell. Naturally, though, the occupational health department of a publicly funded hospital will provide a similar standard of healthcare to that provided for patients.

'''Protective sequestration''' is a [[public health]] term that refers to [[social distancing]] measures taken to protect a small, defined, and still-healthy population from an [[epidemic]] (or [[pandemic]]) ''before'' the [[infection]] reaches that population. It is sometimes referred to as "reverse [[cordon sanitaire]]."

Given the extraordinary nature{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of these measures, they should be considered, if at all, only under exceptional circumstances:
* Implementation is feasible
* The measures can be enforced, and voluntary compliance of the sequestered population is highly likely
* The sequestered population and/or the work they perform merits this effort and justifies the use of these measures.

The term “protective sequestration” was coined by [[Howard Markel]] and his colleagues, in their paper that described the successes and failures of several communities in the United States in their attempts to shield themselves from the 1918-1920 so-called “Spanish Influenza” pandemic during the second wave of that pandemic (September–December 1918).&lt;ref name = "Markel"/&gt;

The term “protective sequestration” avoids the use of the word [[quarantine]], which, in public health, refers to the voluntary or enforced detention of a person who, because of actual or possible contact with a person carrying an infectious agent, may have acquired that agent and be capable of passing it along to others. The duration of the quarantine period is determined by the incubation period of the infection, i.e., the time between acquisition of the infectious agent and the development of signs or symptoms of the illness caused by that agent.

During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], factors that contributed to the rare successes of protective sequestration were the following:
* The community leader(s) recognized the danger posed by the pandemic before it reached the community and implemented protective measures early (before neighboring communities did)
* Taking advantage of the community’s remoteness or natural barriers that were generally, but not always, present, the community leadership established and enforced a cordon around the outer perimeter of the community
* Anyone seeking entry into the community was placed in quarantine for the incubation period of the infection and released into the community only after they were shown to be free of infection. Furthermore, the leadership established a system whereby supplies were delivered and received in a way that eliminated human-to-human contact with those delivering the supplies
* Families were kept together so that life within the protected zone was as normal as possible. Schools remained in session and places of worship remained open, people continued to work, and entertainment remained available
* Protective sequestration measures remained in effect for the duration of the risk.

The best known historical example is the measures taken by the town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]] during the 1918 influenza epidemic. To prevent an introduction of the infection, the town isolated itself from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chm.med.umich.edu/research/1918-influenza-escape-communities/gunnison/ Gunnison: Case Study], University of Michigan Medical School, Center for the History of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; Several other communities adopted similar measures.&lt;ref name = "Markel"&gt;[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/pdfs/06-0506.pdf H. Markel, A.M. Stern,  J. A. Navarro, J. R. Michalsen, A. S. Monto, and C. DiGiovanni, "Nonpharmaceutical Influenza Mitigation Strategies, US Communities, 1918–1920 Pandemic," ''Emerging Infectious Diseases,'' Vol. 12, No. 12, December 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of protective sequestration is that it shields selected people from infection and possibly buys them time for the development and distribution of drugs or vaccine. A disadvantage, apart from its elitism and social and economic cost, is that those sequestered have no opportunity to develop naturally-acquired immunity to the infectious agent through contact with it, and, therefore, they remain susceptible to the agent during subsequent waves of the epidemic or pandemic.

'''Public health informatics''' has been defined as the systematic application of information and [[computer science]] and technology to [[public health]] practice, research, and learning.  It is one of the subdomains of [[health informatics]].

==Definition==
Public health informatics is defined as the use of computers, clinical guidelines, communication and information systems, which apply to vast majority of public health, related professions, such as nursing, clinical/ hospital care/ public health and medical research.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/certificates/public-health-informatics/what-is-health-informatics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In developed countries like  the United States, public health informatics is practiced by individuals in public health agencies at the federal and state levels and in the larger local health jurisdictions.  Additionally, research and training in public health informatics takes place at a variety of academic institutions.

At the federal [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in US states like Atlanta, Georgia, the [https://www.cdc.gov/osels/phsipo Public Health Surveillance and Informatics Program Office (PHSIPO)] focuses on advancing the state of information science and applies digital information technologies to aid in the detection and management of diseases and syndromes in individuals and populations.

The bulk of the work of public health informatics in the United States, as with public health generally, takes place at the state and local level, in the [[State health department|state departments of health]] and the county or parish departments of health.  At a state health department the activities may include: collection and storage of ''vital statistics'' (birth and death records); collection of reports of communicable disease cases from doctors, hospitals, and laboratories, used for infectious disease surveillance; display of infectious disease statistics and trends; collection of child immunization and lead screening information; daily collection and analysis of emergency room data to detect early evidence of biological threats; collection of hospital capacity information to allow for planning of responses in case of emergencies.  Each of these activities presents its own information processing challenge.

===Collection of public health data===

(TODO: describe CDC-provided DOS/desktop-based systems like TIMSS (TB), STDMIS (Sexually transmitted  diseases); Epi-Info for epidemiology investigations; and others )

Since the beginning of the World Wide Web, public health agencies with sufficient information technology resources have been transitioning to web-based collection of public [[health data]], and, more recently, to automated messaging of the same information.  In the years roughly 2000 to 2005 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under its [https://www.cdc.gov/nedss/ National Electronic Disease Surveillance System] (NEDSS), built and provided free to states a comprehensive web and message-based reporting system called the [https://www.cdc.gov/nedss/ NEDSS Base System] (NBS).  Due to the funding being limited and it not being wise to have fiefdom-based systems, only a few states and larger counties have built their own versions of electronic disease surveillance systems, such as Pennsylvania's [https://www.nedss.state.pa.us/nedss/ PA-NEDSS].  These do not provide timely full intestate notification services causing an increase in disease rates versus the NEDSS federal product.

To promote interoperability, the CDC has encouraged the adoption in public [[health data]] exchange of several standard vocabularies and messaging formats from the health care world. The most prominent of these are: the [[Health Level 7]] (HL7) standards for health care messaging; the [[LOINC]] system for encoding laboratory test and result information; and the [[Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine]] (SNOMED) vocabulary of health care concepts.

Since about 2005, the CDC has promoted the idea of the Public Health Information Network to facilitate the transmission of data from various partners in the health care industry and elsewhere (hospitals, clinical and environmental laboratories, doctors' practices, pharmacies) to local health agencies, then to state health agencies, and then to the CDC.  At each stage the entity must be capable of receiving the data, storing it, aggregating it appropriately, and transmitting it to the next level.  A typical example would be infectious disease data, which hospitals, labs, and doctors are legally required to report to local health agencies; local health agencies must report to their state public health department; and which the states must report in aggregate form to the CDC.  Among other uses, the CDC publishes the [[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] (MMWR) based on these data acquired systematically from across the United States.

Major issues in the collection of public [[health data]] are: awareness of the need to report data; lack of resources of either the reporter or collector; lack of interoperability of data interchange formats, which can be at the purely syntactic or at the semantic level; variation in reporting requirements across the states, territories, and localities.

Public health informatics can be thought or divided into three categories.

===Study models of different systems===
The first category is to discover and study models of complex systems, such as disease transmission. This can be done through different types of data collections, such as hospital surveys, or electronic surveys submitted to the organization (such as the CDC). Transmission rates or disease incidence rates/surveillance can be obtained through government organizations, such as the CDC, or global organizations, such as WHO. Not only disease transmission/rates can be looked at. Public health informatics can also delve into people with/without health insurance and the rates at which they go to the doctor. Before the advent of the internet, public health data in the United States, like other healthcare and business data, were collected on paper forms and stored centrally at the relevant public health agency.  If the data were to be computerized they required a distinct data entry process, were stored in the various file formats of the day and analyzed by mainframe computers using standard batch processing.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|website=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6103a5.htm?s_cid=su6103a5_x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage of public health data===

The second category is to find ways to improve the efficiency of different public health systems. This is done through various collections methods, storage of data and how the data is used to improve current health problems. In order to keep everything standardized, vocabulary and word usage needs to be consistent throughout all systems. Finding new ways to link together and share new data with current systems is important to keep everything up to date.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Storage of public health data shares the same [[data management]] issues as other industries.  And like other industries, the details of how these issues play out are affected by the nature of the data being managed.

Due to the complexity and variability of public health data, like health care data generally, the issue of [[data modeling]] presents a particular challenge.  While a generation ago flat data sets for statistical analysis were the norm, today's requirements of interoperability and integrated sets of data across the public health enterprise require more sophistication.  The [[relational database]] is increasingly the norm in public health informatics.  Designers and implementers of the many sets of data required for various public health purposes must find a workable balance between very complex and abstract data models such as [[HL7]]'s [[HL7#Reference Information Model (RIM)|Reference Information Model]] (RIM) or CDC's [https://www.cdc.gov/phin/library/documents/pdf/PHIN_LDM_User_Guide_v1.0.pdf Public Health Logical Data Model], and simplistic, ad hoc models that untrained public health practitioners come up with and feel capable of working with.

Due to the variability of the incoming data to public health jurisdictions, [[data quality assurance]] is also a major issue.

===Analysis of public health data===

Finally, the last category can be thought as maintaining and enriching current systems and models to adapt to overflow of data and storing/sorting of this new data. This can be as simple as connecting directly to an electronic data collection source, such as health records from the hospital, or can go public information (CDC) about disease rates/transmission. Finding new algorithms that will sort through large quantities of data quickly and effectively is necessary as well.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The need to extract usable public health information from the mass of data available requires the public health informaticist to become familiar with a range of analysis tools, ranging from [[business intelligence]] tools to produce routine or ad hoc reports, to sophisticated statistical analysis tools such as [[DAP (software)|DAP]]/[[SAS System|SAS]] and [[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], to [[GIS|Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS) to expose the geographical dimension of public health trends.Such analyses usually require methods that appropriately secure the privacy of the health data. One approach is to separate the individually identifiable variables of the data from the rest&lt;ref name=Mazumdar&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mazumdar S, Konings P, Hewett M |title= Protecting the privacy of individual general practice patient electronic records for geospatial epidemiology research |journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |year=2014|volume=38|issue=6|pages=548–552| doi=10.1111/1753-6405.12262|pmid=25308525|display-authors=etal}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.12262/full&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications in health surveillance and epidemiology===

There are a few organizations out there that provide useful information for those professionals that want to be more involved in public health informatics. Such as the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA). AMIA is for professions that are involved in health care, informatics research, biomedical research, including physicians, scientists, researchers, and students. The main goals of AMIA are to move from ‘bench to bedside’, help improve the impact of health innovations and advance the public health informatics field. They hold annual conferences, online classes and webinars, which are free to their members. There is also a career center specific for the biomedical and health informatics community.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many jobs or fellowships in public health informatics are offered. The CDC (Center for Disease Control) has various fellowship programs, while multiple colleges/companies offer degree programs or training in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.phii.org/what-we-do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rallies ==

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Oral arguments were set for June 18 but postponed until July 9 after the Supreme Court received additional petitions and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral arguments concluded on August 27, with the petitioners against and for the law being instructed to submit memorandums within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

{{Use American English|date=February 2014}}
'''Socialized medicine''' is a term used in the United States to describe and discuss systems of [[universal health care]]: medical and hospital care for all at a nominal cost by means of government regulation of [[health care]] and subsidies derived from [[taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; Because of historically negative associations with [[socialism]] in American culture, the term is usually used [[pejorative]]ly in American political discourse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Paul Burleigh Horton, Gerald R.

Truman]]'s 1947 health-care initiative.&lt;ref&gt;W. Michael Byrd, Linda A.

==Background==
The original meaning was confined to systems in which the government operates health care facilities and employs health care professionals.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210141328/http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|archivedate=2009-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111064610/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|archivedate=2007-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob S. Hacker, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102743.html "Socialized Medicine: Let's Try a Dose, We're Bound to Feel Better"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822064338/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102743.html |date=2016-08-22 }}, ''Washington Post'', March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This narrower usage would apply to the British [[National Health Service]] hospital trusts and health systems that operate in other countries as diverse as Finland, Spain, Israel, and Cuba. The United States [[Veterans Health Administration]] and the medical departments of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|U.S. Army]], [[Surgeon General of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Air Force Medical Service|Air Force]], would also fall under this narrow definition. When used in that way, the narrow definition permits a clear distinction from [[single-payer health care|single payer health insurance]] systems, in which the government finances health care but is not involved in care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Single Payer article from AMSA |url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024133141/http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|title=MedTerms medical dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180758/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, American conservative critics of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] have attempted to broaden the term by applying it to any publicly funded system. [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's Medicare]] system and most of the UK's NHS [[general practitioner]] and [[dentistry|dental]] services, which are systems where health care is delivered by private business with partial or total government funding, fit the broader definition, as do the health care systems of most of Western Europe. In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[US military]]'s [[TRICARE]] fall under that definition. In specific regard to military benefits of a (currently) volunteer military, such care is an owed benefit to a specific group as part of an economic exchange, which muddies the definition yet further.

Most industrialized countries and many developing countries operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]] and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide [[universal health care]].&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818031109/http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 |date=2007-08-18 }}, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14, accessed 2007-10-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States|author=|date=|website=cthealth.server101.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Oberlander]], a professor of health policy at the [[University of North Carolina]], maintains that the term is merely a political pejorative that has been defined to mean different levels of government involvement in health care, depending on what the speaker was arguing against at the time.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 Socialized Medicine Belittled on Campaign Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707232709/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 |date=2017-07-07 }} from NPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used by conservatives in the U.S. to imply that the privately run health care system would become controlled by the government, thereby associating it with [[socialism]], which has negative connotations to some people in American political culture.&lt;ref name="MFriedman"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |title=Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman |accessdate=2008-04-14 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530160511/http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, its usage is controversial,&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; and at odds with the views of conservatives in other countries prepared to defend socialized medicine such as [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184018/http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
When the term "socialized medicine" first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s, it bore no negative connotations. Otto P. Geier, chairman of the Preventive Medicine Section of the [[American Medical Association]], was quoted in ''The New York Times'' in 1917 as praising socialized medicine as a way to "discover disease in its incipiency," help end "venereal diseases, alcoholism, tuberculosis," and "make a fundamental contribution to social welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/07/01/96251567.pdf |title=World at War is Facing a Shortage of Doctors|accessdate=2009-04-02 |date=1917-07-01 |work= |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, the term socialized medicine was routinely used negatively by [[American conservatism|conservative]] opponents of [[publicly funded health care]] who wished to imply it represented socialism, and by extension, communism.&lt;ref name="Slate history lesson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175477 |title=Who's Afraid of Socialized Medicine?

Reid (''The Healing of America'', 2009): &lt;blockquote&gt;The term ["socialized medicine"] was popularized by the public relations firm [[Whitaker and Baxter]] working for the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage President Truman's proposal for a national health care system. It was a label, at the dawn of the [[cold war]], meant to suggest that anybody advocating universal access to health care must be a communist.

The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called [[Operation Coffee Cup]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats' plans to extend [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are forms of [[publicly funded health care]], which fits the looser definition of socialized medicine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Part B coverage (Medical) requires a monthly premium of $96.40 (and possibly higher) and the first $135 of costs per year also fall to the senior, not the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://questions.medicare.gov/cgi-bin/medicare.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2100 Medicare rates&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll released in February 2008, conducted by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]], indicated that Americans are currently divided in their opinions of socialized medicine, and this split correlates strongly with their political party affiliation.&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Poll Finds Americans Split by Political Party Over Whether Socialized Medicine Better or Worse Than Current System |publisher=Harvard School of Public Health |date=2007-02-14 |url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |accessdate=2008-02-27 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217230522/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thirds of those polled said they understood the term "socialized medicine" very well or somewhat well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} When offered descriptions of what such a system could mean, strong majorities believed that it means "the government makes sure everyone has health insurance" (79%) and "the government pays most of the cost of health care" (73%). One third (32%) felt that socialized medicine is a system in which "the government tells doctors what to do."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The poll showed "striking differences" by party affiliation. Among Republicans polled, 70% said that socialized medicine would be worse than the current system. The same percentage of Democrats (70%) said that a socialized medical system would be better than the current system. Independents were more evenly split, with 43% saying socialized medicine would be better and 38% worse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

According to Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, "The phrase 'socialized medicine' really resonates as a pejorative with Republicans. However, that so many Democrats believe that socialized medicine would be an improvement is an indication of their dissatisfaction with our current system." Physicians' opinions have become more favorable toward "socialized medicine."&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"/&gt;

A 2008 survey of doctors, published in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', shows that physicians support universal health care and national health insurance by almost 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN3143203520080331?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true Doctors support universal health care: survey], Reuters, March 31, 2008 (first reported in Annals of Internal Medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversies in the United States==
{{See also|Health care economics}}
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}

Although the marginal scope of free or subsidized medicine provided is much discussed within the political body in most countries with socialized health care systems, there is little or no evidence of strong public pressure for the removal of subsidies or the privatization of health care in those countries. The political distaste for government involvement in health care in the U.S. is a unique counter to the trend found in other developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

In the United States, neither of the main parties favors a socialized system that puts the government in charge of hospitals or doctors, but they do have different approaches to financing and access. Democrats tend to be favorably inclined towards reform that involves more government control over health care financing and citizens' right of access to health care. Republicans are broadly in favor of the status quo, or a reform of the financing system that gives more power to the citizen, often through tax credits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Supporters of government involvement in health care argue that government involvement ensures access, quality, and addresses [[market failure]]s&lt;ref&gt;Office of Health Economics (UK), [http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf The Economics of Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530154951/http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}, Section 3.i, "Market Failure: an Overview," p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; specific to the health care markets. When the government covers the cost of health care, there is no need for individuals or their employers to pay for private insurance.&lt;!--If I'm reading the source correctly, it's oriented towards a British discussion of the NHS.  While it uses the U.S. system as a case study, it's used to illustrate certain issues for a predominately British audience.  It does not provide a good source for the political positions or arguments currently being used in the U.S.--&gt;

Opponents also claim that the absence of a market mechanism may slow innovation in treatment and research.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Both sides have also looked to more philosophical arguments, debating whether people have a fundamental [[Rights|right]] to have health care provided to them by their government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Cost of care===
Socialized medicine amongst industrialized countries tends to be more affordable than in systems where there is little government involvement. A 2003 study examined costs and outputs in the U.S. and other industrialized countries and broadly concluded that the U.S. spends so much because its health care system is more costly. It noted that "the United States spent considerably more on health care than any other country&amp;nbsp;... [yet] most measures of aggregate utilization such as physician visits per capita and hospital days per capita were below the OECD median. Since spending is a product of both the goods and services used and their prices, this implies that much higher prices are paid in the United States than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Gerard F. |last2=Reinhardt |first2=Uwe E. |last3=Hussey |first3=Peter S. |last4=Petrosyan |first4=Varduhi |title=It's the prices, stupid: why the United States is so different from other countries |journal=Health Affairs |date=May 2003 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=89–105 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89|doi-access=free |pmid=12757275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers examined possible reasons and concluded that input costs were high (salaries, cost of pharmaceutical), and that the complex payment system in the U.S. added higher administrative costs. Comparison countries in Canada and Europe were much more willing to exert [[monopsony]] power to drive down prices, whilst the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system was one factor that could explain the relatively high prices in the United States of America.  The current [[fee-for-service]] payment system also stimulates expensive care by promoting procedures over visits through financially rewarding the former ($1,500 – for doing a 10-minute procedure) vs. the latter ($50 – for a 30–45 minute visit).{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This causes the proliferation of specialists (more expensive care) and creating, what [[Donald Berwick|Don Berwick]] refers to as, "the world's best healthcare system for rescue care".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Other studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment; the efficiency of operation of the health care system itself appears to depend much more on how providers are paid and how the delivery of care is organized than on the method used to raise these funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=Sherry Glied |first=Sherry A. |last=Glied |title=Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity |date=March 2008 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13881 |doi=10.3386/w13881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters argue that government involvement in health care would reduce costs not just because of the exercise of monopsony power, e.g. in drug purchasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|title=Single Payer FAQ - Physicians for a National Health Program|author=|date=|website=pnhp.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026121131/http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because it eliminates profit margins and administrative overhead associated with private insurance, and because it can make use of [[economies of scale]] in administration.  In certain circumstances, a volume purchaser may be able to guarantee sufficient volume to reduce overall prices while providing greater profitability to the seller, such as in so-called "[[Advance market commitments|purchase commitment]]" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löfgren |first1=Hans |title=Purchase commitments: Big business bias or solution to the ‘neglected diseases’ dilemma? |journal=Australian Review of Public Affairs |date=31 October 2005 |url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html |accessdate=2018-04-27 |issn=1832-1526|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422072411/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html|archivedate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} Economist [[Arnold Kling]] attributes the present cost crisis mainly to the practice of what he calls ''premium medicine'', which overuses expensive forms of technology that is of marginal or no proven benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Arnold S. |last=Relman |title=Book Review: ''Crisis of Abundance: Rethinking How We Pay for Health Care'' |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue= |pages=1073–1074 |date=2006 |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev57033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] has argued that government has weak incentives to reduce costs because "nobody spends somebody else’s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own".&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"&gt;Milton Friedman, [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html How to Cure Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072208/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that health care consumption is not like other consumer consumption. Firstly there is a negative utility of consumption (consuming more health care does not make one better off) and secondly there is an [[information asymmetry]] between consumer and supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blomqvist |first=Åke |last2=Léger |first2=Pierre Thomas |year=2005 |title=Information asymmetry, insurance and the decision to hospitalize |journal=[[Journal of Health Economics]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=775–93 |doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2004.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]] and [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]] argue that all of the evidence indicates that public insurance of the kind available in several European countries achieves equal or better results at much lower cost, a conclusion that also applies within the United States. In terms of actual administrative costs, Medicare spent less than 2% of its resources on administration, while private insurance companies spent more than 13%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman and Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}, The New York Review of Books, Volume 53, Number 5, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] argues that the 2% Medicare cost figure ignores all costs shifted to doctors and hospitals, and alleges that Medicare is not very efficient at all when those costs are incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=John Goodman | title=Five Myths of Socialized Medicine | work=[[Cato Institute]] | date=Winter 2005 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | format=PDF | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100531/https://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | archivedate=2006-12-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found that the U.S. wastes more on bureaucracy (compared to the Canadian level), and that this excess administrative cost would be sufficient to provide health care to the uninsured population in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of New England Journal of Medicine Study, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php USA wastes more on health care bureaucracy than it would cost to provide health care to all of the uninsured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223201811/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php |date=2008-02-23 }}, Medical News Today, 28 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the arguments about Medicare, there is overall less bureaucracy in socialized systems than in the present mixed U.S. system. Spending on administration in Finland is 2.1% of all health care costs, and in the UK the figure is 3.3% whereas the U.S. spends 7.3% of all expenditures on administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Figure 14. Percentage of National Health Expenditures Spent on Health Administration and Insurance |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/Collins_universal_hlt_insurance_testimony_06-26-2007_figures.ppt?section=4039#320,14 |date=2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720063009/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/Collins_universal_hlt_insurance_testimony_06-26-2007_figures.ppt?section=4039 |archive-date=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of care===
Some in the U.S. claim that socialized medicine would reduce health care quality. The quantitative evidence for this claim is not clear. The WHO has used Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy (the number of years an average person can expect to live in good health) as a measure of a nation's health achievement, and has ranked its member nations by this measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144538/http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} WHO. World Health Report 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. ranking was 24th, worse than similar industrial countries with high public funding of health such as Canada (ranked 5th), the UK (12th), Sweden (4th), France (3rd) and Japan (1st). But the U.S. ranking was better than some other European countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, which came 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. Finland, with its relatively high death rate from guns and renowned high suicide rate came above the U.S. in 20th place. The British have a [[Care Quality Commission]] that commissions independent surveys of the quality of care given in its health institutions and these are publicly accessible over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhssurveys.org|title=NHS Surveys :: Focused on patients' experience :: Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhssurveys.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307201512/http://nhssurveys.org/|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These determine whether health organizations are meeting public standards for quality set by government and allows regional comparisons. Whether these results indicate a better or worse situation to that in other countries such as the U.S. is hard to tell because these countries tend to lack a similar set of standards.

===Taxation===
Opponents claim that socialized medicine would require higher taxes but international comparisons do not support this; the ratio of public to private spending on health is lower in the U.S. than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or any EU country, yet the per capita tax funding of health in those countries is already lower than that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Indicator_tables.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226204118/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_indicator_tables.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }} UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 Table 6 Page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation is not necessarily an unpopular form of funding for health care. In England, a survey for the [[British Medical Association]] of the general public showed overwhelming support for the tax funding of health care. Nine out of ten people agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that the NHS should be funded from taxation with care being free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227150902/http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/%24FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }} Survey of the general public’s views on NHS system reform - in England: BMA June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[opinion piece]] in ''The Wall Street Journal'' by two conservative Republicans argues that government sponsored health care will legitimatize support for government services generally, and make an activist government acceptable. "Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care -- an argument that would resonate with middle-class families entirely dependent on the government for access to doctors and hospitals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120205305/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 |date=2018-01-20 }}, [[Peter Wehner]] and Paul Ryan, The Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
Some in the U.S. argue that if government were to use its size to bargain down health care prices, this would undermine American leadership in medical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Cowen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "Poor U.S. Scores in Health Care Don’t Measure Nobels and Innovation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213302/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=2011-07-08 }}, ''The New York Times'', October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Chan, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 "We're Number 37 in Health Care!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411014948/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the high level of spending in the U.S. health care system and its tolerance of waste is actually beneficial because it underpins American leadership in medical innovation, which is crucial not just for Americans, but for the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kling   | first = Arnold   | author-link = Arnold Kling  | title = Two health-care documentaries | periodical = The Washington Times   | date = June 30, 2007   | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point out that the American health care system spends more on state-of-the-art treatment for people who have good insurance, and spending is reduced on those lacking it&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and question the costs and benefits of some medical innovations, noting, for example, that "rising spending on new medical technologies designed to address heart disease has not meant that more patients have survived."&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Mahar, [http://alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 The Mythology of Boomers Bankrupting Our Healthcare System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214142005/http://www.alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 |date=2009-02-14 }}, Health Beat, April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access===
One of the goals of socialized medicine systems is ensuring universal access to health care. Opponents of socialized medicine say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than socialized medicine, for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services. Economist [[Milton Friedman]] said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases.&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"/&gt; Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with socialized medicine in the broader sense, such as [[Healthcare in Germany|Germany]] and [[Health care in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed [[income redistribution]] via the tax system{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.

Compulsory health insurance or savings are not limited to so-called socialized medicine, however. Singapore's health care system, which is often referred to as a [[free-market]] or [[Mixed economy|mixed]] system, makes use of a combination of compulsory participation and state price controls to achieve the same goals.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210052940/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=2012-12-10 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationing (access, coverage, price, and time)===
{{See also|Healthcare rationing in the United States}}

Part of the current debate about [[health care in the United States]] revolves around whether the [[Affordable Care Act]] as part of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] will result in a more systematic and logical allocation of health care. Opponents tend to believe that the law will eventually result in a government takeover of health care and ultimately to socialized medicine and rationing based not on being able to afford the care you want but on whether a third party other than the patient and the doctor decides whether the procedure or the cost is justifiable. Supporters of reform point out that health care rationing already exists in the United States through insurance companies either denying coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s or applying differential pricing for this coverage, or issuing denial for reimbursement on the grounds that the insurance company believes the procedure is [[Medical research|experimental]] or will not assist even though the doctor has recommended it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmbc.com/r/6882159/detail.html Man Dies After Insurance Co.

Opponents of reform invoke the term socialized medicine because they say it will lead to health care rationing by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently&lt;ref&gt;"95,000+ U.S. patients are currently waiting for an organ transplant; nearly 4,000 new patients are added to the waiting list each month. Every day, 17 people die while waiting for a transplant of a vital organ, such as a heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung or bone marrow. Because of the lack of available donors in this country, 3,916 kidney patients, 1,570 liver patients, 356 heart patients and 245 lung patients died in 2006 while waiting for life-saving organ transplants:National Kidney Foundation http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon&amp;trans.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711030138/http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon%26trans.cfm |date=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with socialized medicine.&lt;ref&gt;"Right now more than 8,000 people in the UK need an organ transplant that could save or improve their life. But each year around 400 people die while waiting for a transplant". National Kidney Federation. {{cite web |url=http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223044349/http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}. (Note: The UK population is about one sixth the size of the U.S. population).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a socialized medicine system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.

There is a frequent misunderstanding to think that waiting happens in places like the United Kingdom and Canada but does not happen in the United States. For instance it is not uncommon even for emergency cases in some U.S. hospitals to be boarded on beds in hallways for 48 hours or more due to lack of inpatient beds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = GIFFIN  | author2 = SHARI M.

&lt;/ref&gt; and people in the U.S. rationed out by being unable to afford their care are simply never counted and may never receive the care they need, a factor that is often overlooked. Statistics about waiting times in national systems are an honest approach to the issue of those waiting for access to care. Everyone waiting for care is reflected in the data, which, in the UK for example, are used to inform debate, decision-making and research within the government and the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|title=What does the Department of Health do? - Health Questions - NHS Direct&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=nhsdirect.nhs.uk|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031075726/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|title=Health Indicators - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|date=|website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513015835/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012102149/http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-12 |df= }} Setting new standards for your care: 2007 NHS patient leaflet on the 18 week maximum wait time promise for Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people in the U.S. are rationed out of care by unaffordable care or denial of access by [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] and insurers or simply because they cannot afford co-pays or deductibles even if they have insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Why we must Ration Health Care | work=[[New York Times]] | date=July 15, 2009 | quote=But if the stories ... lead us to think badly of the British system of rationing health care, we should remind ourselves that the U.S. system also results in people going without life-saving treatment&amp;nbsp;— it just does so less visibly.

Opponents of the current reform care proposals fear that U.S. comparative effective research (a plan introduced in the stimulus bill) will be used to curtail spending and ration treatments, which is one function of the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), arguing that rationing by market pricing rather by government is the best way for care to be rationed. However, when defining any group scheme, the same rules must apply to everyone in the scheme so some coverage rules had to be established. Britain has a national budget for public funded health care, and recognizes there has to be a logical trade off between spending on expensive treatments for some against, for example, caring for sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515102140/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }} Quote "Britain’s National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation’s care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children." from NY Times article Dec 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NICE is therefore applying the same market pricing principles to make the hard job of deciding between funding some treatments and not funding others on behalf of everyone in the insured pool. This rationing does not preclude choice of obtaining insurance coverage for excluded treatment as insured persons do having the choice to take out supplemental health insurance for drugs and treatments that the NHS does not cover (at least one private insurer offers such a plan) or from meeting treatment costs out-of-pocket.

The debate in the U.S. over rationing has enraged some in the UK and statements made by politicians such as [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Chuck Grassley]] resulted in a mass Internet protest on websites such as Twitter and Facebook under the banner title "welovetheNHS" with positive stories of NHS experiences to counter the negative ones being expressed by these politicians and others and by certain media outlets such as ''Investor's Business Daily'' and Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/14/welove-thenhs-115875-21595748/The Mirror (UK newspaper) on public reaction and rage in UK to Palin, Grassley, IBD, and Fox (Hanan) interviews intended to denigrate the NHS&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, it is private health insurers that ration care (in the sense of not covering the most common services such as access to a primary care physician or excluding pre-existing conditions) rather than the NHS. Free access to a general practitioner is a core right in the NHS, but private insurers in the UK will not pay for payments to a private primary care physician.&lt;ref name="ABI"/&gt; Private insurers exclude many of the most common services as well as many of the most expensive treatments, whereas the vast majority of these are not excluded from the NHS but are obtainable at no cost to the patient. According to the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI), a typical policy will exclude the following: going to a general practitioner; going to [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]]; drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; normal pregnancy; gender reassignment; mobility aids, such as wheelchairs; organ transplant; injuries arising from dangerous hobbies (often called hazardous pursuits); pre-existing conditions; dental services; outpatient drugs and dressings; deliberately self-inflicted injuries; infertility; cosmetic treatment; experimental or unproven treatment or drugs; and war risks. Chronic illnesses, such as [[diabetes]] and [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] requiring [[dialysis]] are also excluded from coverage.&lt;ref name="ABI"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Consumers/Health_and_Protection/496.pdf|title=Are you buying private medical insurance?

Palin had alleged that America will create rationing "[[death panels]]" to decide whether old people could live or die, again widely taken to be a reference to NICE. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley alleged that he was told that Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] would have been refused the brain tumor treatment he was receiving in the United States had he instead lived a country with government run health care. This, he alleged, would have been due to rationing because of Kennedy's age (77 years) and the high cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Audio of Senator Grassly repeating allegation Sen Kennedy would not receive care in the UK on grounds of his age. {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZK8ffUpL60 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414063816/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZK8ffUpL60 |archivedate=2016-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK Department of Health said that Grassley’s claims were "just wrong" and reiterated health service in Britain provides health care on the basis of clinical need regardless of age or ability to pay.

Some argue that waiting lists result in great pain and suffering, but again evidence for this is unclear. In a recent survey of patients admitted to hospital in the UK from a waiting list or by planned appointment, only 10% reported they felt they should have been admitted sooner than they were. 72% reported the admission was as timely as they felt necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031549/http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }} Healthcare Commission: 'Survey of adult inpatients in the NHS 2007'&lt;/ref&gt; Medical facilities in the U.S. do not report waiting times in national statistics as is done in other countries and it is a myth to believe there is no waiting for care in the U.S. Some argue that wait times in the U.S. could actually be as long as or longer than in other countries with universal health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007064527/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |archivedate=2008-10-07 |df= }} ''Business Week'': The doctor will see you in 3 months&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable argument about whether any of the health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing. [[Howard Dean]] for example contested in an interview that they do not. However, ''[[Politico]]'' has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=dean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|title=There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830200720/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|archivedate=August 30, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political interference and targeting===
In the UK, where government employees or government-employed sub-contractors deliver most health care, political interference is quite hard to discern. Most supply-side decisions are in practice under the control of medical practitioners and of boards comprising the medical profession. There is some antipathy towards the target-setting by politicians in the UK. Even the NICE criteria for public funding of medical treatments were never set by politicians. Nevertheless, politicians have set targets, for instance to reduce waiting times and to improve choice.  Academics have pointed out that the claims of success of the targeting are statistically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A&amp;E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf Cass Business School: Academics challenge A&amp;E waiting times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910021448/http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A%26E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The veracity and significance of the claims of targeting interfering with clinical priorities are often hard to judge. For example, some UK ambulance crews have complained that hospitals would deliberately leave patients with ambulance crews to prevent an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E, or emergency room) target-time for treatment from starting to run. The Department of Health vehemently denied the claim, because the A&amp;E time begins when the ambulance arrives at the hospital and not after the handover. It defended the A&amp;E target by pointing out that the percentage of people waiting four hours or more in A&amp;E had dropped from just under 25% in 2004 to less than 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm BBC News:Anger at 'patient stacking' claim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ''Observer'' article reported that in London, 14,700 ambulance turnarounds were longer than an hour and 332 were more than two hours when the target turnaround time is 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the context of the total number of emergency ambulance attendances by the [[London Ambulance Service]] each year (approximately 865,000),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031548/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; these represent just 1.6% and 0.03% of all ambulance calls. The proportion of these attributable to patients left with ambulance crews is not recorded. At least one junior doctor has complained that the four-hour A&amp;E target is too high and leads to unwarranted actions that are not in the best interests of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | work=BBC News | title=Minister blasted over A&amp;E target | date=June 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030192743/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | archivedate=October 30, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political targeting of waiting-times in Britain has had dramatic effects. The [[National Health Service]] reports that the median admission wait-time for elective inpatient treatment (non-urgent hospital treatment) in England at the end of August 2007, was just under 6 weeks, and 87.5% of patients were admitted within 13 weeks. Reported waiting times in England also overstate the true waiting-time. This is because the clock starts ticking when the patient has been referred to a specialist by the GP and it only stops when the medical procedure is completed. The 18-week maximum waiting period target thus includes all the time taken for the patient to attend the first appointment with the specialist, time for any tests called for by the specialist to determine precisely the root of the patient's problem and the best way to treat it. It excludes time for any intervening steps deemed necessary prior to treatment, such as recovery from some other illness or the losing of excessive weight.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire''' (SDQ) is a [[self-report inventory]] behavioral screening [[questionnaire]] for children and adolescents ages 2 through 17 years old, developed by [[United Kingdom]] child psychiatrist [[Robert N Goodman|Robert N. Goodman]]. The SDQ is available online &lt;ref&gt;http://sdqscore.org&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into more than 80 languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="SDQ website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|url=http://sdqinfo.org/py/sdqinfo/b0.py|website=Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the SDQ has been proven to have satisfactory [[Construct validity|construct]] and [[concurrent validity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Lisanne L.|last2=Otten|first2=Roy|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C.

There are three versions of the SDQ: a ''short form'', a ''longer form'' with impact supplement, and a ''follow-up form'' designed for use after a behavioral intervention. The questionnaire takes 3–10 minutes to complete.

==Scoring==
The SDQ scoring site allows one to score paper copies of a parent, teacher and/or self-report and generates a brief report. Each of the five scales of the SDQ are scored from 0-10, and one can add up four of these (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity and peer problems) to create a '''total difficulty score''' (range 0-40).&lt;ref name="Goodman, R. 1997. p. 581-6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodman |first=R. |title=The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: a research note |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines |date=July 1997 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=581-6 |pmid=9255702 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One can also add the emotional and peer items together to get an internalising problems score (range 0-20) and add the conduct and hyperactivity questions together to get an externalising score (range 0-20).

===Total difficulty score===
; Dimensional measure
: The total difficulty score of the SDQ (range 0-40) is a fully dimensional measure, with each one-point increase in the total difficulty score corresponding to an increase in the risk of mental health disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Robert |last2=Goodman |title=Strengths and difficulties questionnaire as a dimensional measure of child mental health |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=April 2009 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=400-3 |pmid=19242383 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181985068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   As such, one can use the total difficulty score as a dimensional measure in research, e.g. comparing mean scores between groups or as a continuous outcome in linear regression analysis.
; Categories based on single-informant symptoms scores
: Alternatively, particularly when using the SDQ for screening purposes, it may be useful to turn symptom scores into categories.  An initial three-category solution was proposed by Youth in Mind, the owner of the SDQ ('normal'/'borderline'/'abnormal') with the cut-offs chosen using normative data from large population-based UK studies.  More recently, an alternative four-category solution has been adopted by Youth in Mind, with cut-offs chosen such that 80% of children score 'close to average', 10% are 'slightly raised', 5% 'high' and 5% 'very high'.  
; Categories based on multi-informant symptom + impact scores
: The SDQ scoring website also allows one to categorise children according to their risk of [[ICD-10]] or [[DSM-IV]] disorder based on triangulating information across all available informants (parent, teacher, self-report) and using the impact supplement as well as the symptom score.  This is done for the disorder groupings 'any disorder', 'emotional disorder', conduct disorder' and 'hyperactivity disorder'.  For each diagnostic grouping, there are three possible predictions: low risk, medium risk and high risk.  In general, empirical studies show that for children defined as being at 'low risk' on the SDQ, around 1-4% turn out to have a disorder when assessed by experts.  For children at 'medium risk' the proportion is 10-15%, and for children at 'high risk' the proportion is 25-60%.
; Prevalence estimates for UK research
: UK researchers can use validated SDQ algorithms to convert a given SDQ mean score into a predicted prevalence of disorder in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Robert |last2=Goodman |title=Population mean scores predict child mental disorder rates: validating SDQ prevalence estimators in Britain |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines |date=January 2011 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=100-8 |pmid=20722879 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02278.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be useful in translating research findings for policymakers or practitioners, or in assessing likely levels of need for child mental health services.

===Scales===
One can also use the 5 scales of the SDQ either as dimensions (range 0-10) or else categorised into three- or four-categories in a similar was as is done for the total difficulty score.  Alternatively, one can combine scales such that emotional+peer problems scales form a larger internalising scale (range 0-20) and the conduct + hyperactivity scales form a larger externalising scale (range 0=20).  Research suggests that in low-risk groups (e.g. a general population sample) the latter approach may be preferable, as there is less discrimination between the finer scales for lower scores (e.g. a child with a score of 2 on the hyperactivity scale is at increased risk of hyperactivity and behavioural disorder to a roughly equal degree).  By contrast in high-risk samples (e.g. a clinic setting) the 5 finer scales may come into their own, as there is much more discrimination between them at higher scores (e.g. a child with a score of 7 on the hyperactivity scale is specifically at greater risk of a hyperactivity disorder, to a greater degree than they are at increased risk of a behavioural disorder)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Donna L. |last2=Lamping |first3=George B. |last3=Ploubidis |title=When to use broader internalising and externalising subscales instead of the hypothesised five subscales on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ): data from British parents, teachers and children |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology |date=November 2010 |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1179-91 |pmid=20623175 |doi=10.1007/s10802-010-9434-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SDQ users===
The [[PhenX Toolkit]] uses SDQ as its child protocol for General Psychiatric Assessment and for Broad Psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol Overview: General Psychiatric Assessment - Child |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 19.0 |date=17 January 2017 |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=120102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol Overview: Broad Psychopathology - Child |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 19.0 |date=17 January 2017 |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=610202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The SDQ is implemented in numerous [[electronic health record]] systems.

'''Subjective response to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]''' (SR) refers to an individual's unique experience of the pharmacological effects of alcohol and is a putative risk factor for the development of [[Alcoholism|alcohol use disorder]]. Subjective effects include both stimulating experiences typically occurring during the beginning of a drinking episode as breath alcohol content (BAC) rises and sedative effects, which are more prevalent later in a drinking episode as BAC wanes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The combined influence of hedonic and aversive subjective experiences over the course of a drinking session are strong predictors of alcohol consumption and drinking consequences.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roche|first=Daniel JO|last2=Ray|first2=Lara A|date=2015-05-01|title=Subjective response as a consideration in the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism treatment|journal=Pharmacogenomics|volume=16|issue=7|pages=721–736|doi=10.2217/pgs.14.143|pmid=25950242|issn=1462-2416|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4sk8b7hx}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also mounting evidence for consideration of SR as an [[endophenotype]] with some studies suggesting that it accounts for a significant proportion of genetic risk for the development of alcohol use disorder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Corbin|first2=William R.|last3=Treat|first3=Teresa A.|date=December 2015|title=Evaluating the accuracy of alcohol expectancies relative to subjective response to alcohol|journal=Addictive Behaviors|volume=51|pages=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.07.027|pmid=26291291|last1=Morean|first1=Meghan E.|pmc=4772766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical models  ==

=== Low Level of Response Model ===

The Low Level of Response Model proposes that individuals who are less sensitive to the effects of alcohol are at greater risk for developing alcohol use disorder. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the experiences of elevated intoxication constitutes a feedback mechanism, which prompts drinking cessation. Low-level responders need to consume more alcohol than high responders to achieve a similar level of intoxication and experience the aversive effects of alcohol; consequently, these individuals must consume more alcohol to trigger the negative feedback loop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Escalating alcohol consumption may ultimately contribute to the development of tolerance, which further dampens sensitivity to alcohol's unpleasant effects. Notably, there is no population-level demarcation separating low from high responders and so level of response is arbitrarily defined (generally in terciles) within a given sample.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Early studies compared SR in individuals (mostly males) with (FH+) and without (FH-) a history of [[alcohol dependence]] in order to demonstrate that individual differences in SR could be considered genetically-linked determinants of alcohol use disorder. Non-placebo controlled studies conducted by Schuckit and colleagues found that FH+ males experienced less of the aversive effects of alcohol as compared to FH- males matched on key demographic and body mass variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, FH+ young males and their fathers showed similar SR after reaching peak BAC, suggesting that SR is a heritable risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Schuckit's placebo-controlled studies generally reported lower SR among FH+, as compared to FH-, subjects along declining BAC, with differences more evident among men than women. Additional studies found that FH+ subjects who experienced low-level of response were more than 4 times as likely to meet criteria for alcohol use disorder at 10-year follow-up as compared to FH- subjects who reported the same SR pattern.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subsequent follow-up studies conducted primarily by Schuckit's group established that low-level of response is a genetically-linked risk factor for alcohol use disorder, which is not better explained by robust [[confounding factor]]s such as age of first drink, current alcohol use and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trim|first=Ryan S.|last2=Schuckit|first2=Marc A.|last3=Smith|first3=Tom L.|date=2009-09-01|title=The Relationships of the Level of Response to Alcohol and Additional Characteristics to Alcohol Use Disorders Across Adulthood: A Discrete-Time Survival Analysis|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|language=en|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1562–1570|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.00984.x|issn=1530-0277|pmc=2947374|pmid=19485971}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1992 meta-analysis further buttressed the Low Level of Response Model by reporting that sons of alcoholics exhibited lower responses to alcohol on both the ascending and descending limbs of the BAC curve. Importantly, differences in SR by family history were significant only in the alcohol condition and not the placebo condition, suggesting that SRs observed in the alcohol condition could be attributed to the pharmacological effects of alcohol, rather than to a confounding factor.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1992-11-01|title=Meta-analysis of subjective sensitivity to alcohol in sons of alcoholics|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=149|issue=11|pages=1534–1538|doi=10.1176/ajp.149.11.1534|issn=0002-953X|pmid=1415821 | last1 = Pollock | first1 = VE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis revealed that FH+ individuals reported lower SR in comparison to FH- individuals across both limbs of intoxication, consistent with the Low Level of Response Model.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These findings were more robust along the descending limb of the BAC curve where sedative effects of alcohol are more prevalent and among males who comprised the overwhelming majority of participants in early SR studies.

Critics noted that studies supporting the Low Level of Response Model only accounted for the negatively valenced sedative effects of alcohol and that while decreased sensitivity to aversive effects of alcohol would likely lead to increased drinking frequency and severity, the subjective effects of alcohol are, in actuality, quite varied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, it is widely accepted that the rewarding properties of alcohol are reinforcing. Yet, according to the Low Level of Response Model, reduced sensitivity to these rewarding effects is an indicator of problematic drinking. To that end, critics have noted that in Schuckit's seminal SR study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Self-rating of alcohol intoxication by young men with and without family histories of alcoholism.|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; FH+ males experienced more "energy" than FH- males along rising BAC, suggesting that heightened sensitivity to the stimulating effects of alcohol may convey risk for developing alcohol problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another study found that FH+ subjects reported experiencing less intoxication than FH- subjects in response to a placebo drink, indicating that alcohol expectancies may account for differences in risk more so than SR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Malley|first=S S|last2=Maisto|first2=S A|date=2015-01-04|title=Effects of family drinking history and expectancies on responses to alcohol in men.|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=289–297|doi=10.15288/jsa.1985.46.289}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, individuals at greatest risk for developing alcohol use disorder may expect alcohol to be more enjoyable and less aversive than low-risk individuals.

=== Differentiator Model ===

The Differentiator Model&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Thomson|first2=James B.|date=1990|title=Alcohol challenge with sons of alcoholics: A critical review and analysis.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=108|issue=3|pages=383–402|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.383|pmid=2270234|last1=Newlin|first1=David B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the widely accepted notion that alcohol's effects are biphasic. That is, the stimulating effects of alcohol (i.e., euphoria, sociality, energy) are more prevalent as BAC rises (i.e., ascending limb), while alcohol's sedative effects (i.e., relaxation, nausea, headaches) are experienced most strongly as BAC falls (i.e., descending limb). The Differentiator Model proposes that individuals at greatest risk for developing alcohol use disorder (or those who already meet criteria for alcohol use disorder) are more sensitive to the stimulating effects of alcohol on the ascending limb of intoxication and less sensitive to the sedative effects on the descending limb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Fromme|first2=K|date=October 2011|title=Subjective response to alcohol challenge: a quantitative review|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=35|issue=10|pages=1759–70|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01521.x |pmid=21777258|last1=Quinn|first1=P|pmc=3183255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the combination of heightened rewards and diminished consequences over the course of a drinking episode increases motivation to consume alcohol, leading to longer and more frequent drinking episodes. Repeated engagement in these risky drinking occasions may ultimately contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder.

Support for the Differentiator Model is mixed, perhaps reflecting the paucity of studies designed to test the model itself or record SR over both limbs of intoxication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both oral and intravenous alcohol administration studies reported that FH+ subjects experienced elevated sensitivity to stimulating effects of alcohol along rising BAC, without the corresponding attenuation of sedative effects as BAC fell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study using an intravenous alcohol clamping method (participants were titrated to a BAC of .06 g/dl whereupon alcohol was infused to maintain a stable BAC for the duration of the study) reported that FH+ subjects experienced heightened stimulation on the ascending limb of intoxication, consistent with the Differentiator Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morzorati|first=S. L.|last2=Ramchandani|first2=V. A.|last3=Flury|first3=L.|last4=Li|first4=T.-K.|last5=O'Connor|first5=S.|date=2002-08-01|title=Self-Reported Subjective Perception of Intoxication Reflects Family History of Alcoholism When Breath Alcohol Levels Are Constant|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|language=en|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1299–1306|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2002.tb02670.x|issn=1530-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, FH+ subjects reported decreased stimulation during clamping, indicative of acute tolerance.

Findings by King and colleagues, which are largely corroborated by a recent meta-analysis, suggest that the Differentiator Model best characterizes heavy drinkers at risk for developing alcohol use disorder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Specifically, over the course of several studies, heavy drinkers reported greater positive SR on the ascending limb of intoxication and lower negative SR on the descending limb, in relation to light drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Andrea C.|last2=Wit|first2=Harriet de|last3=McNamara|first3=Patrick J.|last4=Cao|first4=Dingcai|date=2011-04-04|title=Rewarding, Stimulant, and Sedative Alcohol Responses and Relationship to Future Binge Drinking|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=4|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.26|issn=0003-990X|pmc=4633413|pmid=21464363|pages=389–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased sensitivity to alcohol's stimulating effects along rising BAC and muted sensitivity to alcohol's sedative effects along waning BAC were subsequently predictive of future increases in binge drinking, blackouts, hangovers and alcohol use disorder symptomatology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Andrea C.|last2=McNamara|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Hasin|first3=Deborah S.|last4=Cao|first4=Dingcai|title=Alcohol Challenge Responses Predict Future Alcohol Use Disorder Symptoms: A 6-Year Prospective Study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322313007154|journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=75|issue=10|pages=798–806|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.08.001|pmc=4280017|pmid=24094754|date=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Andrea C.|last2=Hasin|first2=Deborah|last3=O’Connor|first3=Sean J.|last4=McNamara|first4=Patrick J.|last5=Cao|first5=Dingcai|title=A Prospective 5-Year Re-examination of Alcohol Response in Heavy Drinkers Progressing in Alcohol Use Disorder|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322315004047|journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=79|issue=6|pages=489–498|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.05.007|pmc=4644521|pmid=26117308|date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS) captures sensations frequently associated with intoxication such as "clumsy," "dizzy," "drunk" and "high" and was administered extensively in early SR studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judd|first=Lewis L.|date=1977-04-01|title=Lithium Carbonate and Ethanol Induced "Highs" in Normal Subjects|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=34|issue=4|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1977.01770160097008|pmid=322635|issn=0003-990X|pages=463–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SHAS is typically administered as a visual analog scale, allowing subjects to rate the extent to which they experienced each symptom during a given experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuckit|first=Marc A.|date=1988-03-01|title=A Simultaneous Evaluation of Multiple Markers of Ethanol/Placebo Challenges in Sons of Alcoholics and Controls|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=45|issue=3|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800270019002|pmid=3422553|issn=0003-990X|pages=211–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the measure argue that it primarily captures the sedative effects of alcohol while omitting many of alcohol's stimulating properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Biphasic Effects of Alcohol Scale (BAES) assesses 7 stimulating (elated, energized, excited stimulated, talkative, up, vigorous) and 7 sedative (difficulty concentrating, down, heavy head, inactive, sedated, slow thoughts, sluggish) effects of alcohol along an 11-point scale.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Christopher S.|last2=Earleywine|first2=Mitchell|last3=Musty|first3=Richard E.|last4=Perrine|first4=M.

== Genetic moderators ==
Most [[Genetics|genetic]] studies in addiction research focus on the genetic determinants of diagnostic [[phenotype]]s such as alcohol use disorder. However, because the causes of alcohol use disorder are so numerous and varied, researchers have turned their attention to endophenotypes, or distinct, genetically-linked phenotypes associated with a broad disorder. Endophenotypes are especially useful in addictions research because they are more closely linked to genetic variations than the broad disorder. Therefore, investigators have explored the effects of genetic variation in the [[endogenous opioid]] system and the [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABAergic]] system on SR.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alcohol activates endogenous opioid receptors, potentiating dopamine release which increases the rewarding effects of alcohol. To that end, the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mu-opioid receptor gene (''OPRM1''), has garnered much interest as a potential moderator of SR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arias |first1=Albert |last2=Feinn |first2=Richard |last3=Kranzler |first3=Henry R. |date=July 2006 |title= Association of an Asn40Asp (A118G) polymorphism in the μ-opioid receptor gene with substance dependence: A meta-analysis |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=262–268 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.11.024 |pmid=16387451 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871605003807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that G-allele carriers experience the stimulating, hedonic effects of alcohol more strongly than A homozygotes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jermaine D.|last2=Comer|first2=Sandra D.|last3=Kranzler|first3=Henry R.|date=2015-03-01|title=The Pharmacogenetics of Alcohol Use Disorder|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=391–402|doi=10.1111/acer.12643|issn=1530-0277|pmc=4348335|pmid=25703505}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study of non-treatment seeking participants with alcohol dependence found that A homozygotes experienced more stimulation than G carriers, and a study of heavy drinkers reported no differences in SR between ''OPRM1'' genotype. These mixed findings may stem from differences in alcohol use severity among samples, as the allostatic model of addiction contends that individuals shift from reward to relief drinking as alcohol use disorder progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koob|first=George F.|last2=Le Moal|first2=Michel|date=2001-02-01|title=Drug Addiction, Dysregulation of Reward, and Allostasis|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v24/n2/full/1395603a.html|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=97–129|doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00195-0|issn=0893-133X|pmid=11120394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is possible that social drinkers and individuals with mild alcohol use disorder may experience the hedonic effects of alcohol as most salient while individuals with more severe alcohol use disorder may consume alcohol for its negative reinforcing properties (i.e., to reduce withdrawal symptoms). The use of retrospective, instead of real time, self-reports of SR as well as differences in ethnicities of samples may further contribute to discrepancies in studies exploring the effects of the ''OPRM1'' gene and SR. Taken together, the literature pertaining to the expression of SR by ''OPRM1'' genotype suggests that the A118G SNP of the ''OPRM1'' gene is associated with enhanced sensitivity to the stimulating, but not sedative, effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Expression of the ''DAT1'' dopamine transporter gene has also been shown to predict severity of alcohol use disorder symptoms with a recent study linking simultaneous carriers of the ''OPRM1'' G-allele and ''DAT1'' A10 allele homozygotes to pleasurable subjective effects along rising BAC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Alcohol researchers have also evaluated the role of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors as moderators of SR. Most investigation has focused on genes coding for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are involved in dopamine release. Some studies have linked ''GABRA2'' and ''GABRG1'' genes to reductions in the experience of positive and negative subjective effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Clinical implications ==
Because SR is such a strong predictor of future alcohol consumption and problems, medication development has focused on drugs which either reduce the pleasant or increase the unpleasant effects of alcohol.

[[Naltrexone]], an opioid receptor antagonist, is frequently prescribed to patients suffering from alcohol use disorder, with moderate effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C. Garbutt|first=James|date=2010-06-01|title=Efficacy and Tolerability of Naltrexone in the Management of Alcohol Dependence|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpd/2010/00000016/00000019/art00003|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|volume=16|issue=19|pages=2091–2097|doi=10.2174/138161210791516459|pmid=20482515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that naltrexone reduces the stimulating and heightens the aversive sedative effects of alcohol in individuals at-risk for alcohol use disorder, contributing to decreases in self-reported subjective high and liking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Andrea C.|last2=Volpicelli|first2=Joseph R.|last3=Frazer|first3=A.|last4=O’Brien|first4=Charles P.|title=Effect of naltrexone on subjective alcohol response in subjects at high and low risk for future alcohol dependence|journal=Psychopharmacology|language=en|volume=129|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s002130050156|pmid=9122358|issn=0033-3158|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCaul|first=Mary E.|last2=Wand|first2=Gary S.|last3=Eissenberg|first3=Thomas|last4=Rohde|first4=Charles A.|last5=Cheskin|first5=Lawrence J.|date=2000-05-01|title=Naltrexone Alters Subjective and Psychomotor Responses to Alcohol in Heavy Drinking Subjects|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v22/n5/full/1395471a.html|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=22|issue=5|pages=480–492|doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00147-5|issn=0893-133X|pmid=10731623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Lara A.|last2=Hutchison|first2=Kent E.|date=2007-09-01|title=Effects of Naltrexone on Alcohol Sensitivity and Genetic Moderators of Medication Response|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=64|issue=9|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.9.1069|issn=0003-990X|pages=1069–77|pmid=17768272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one study has reported on the effects of naltrexone on SR in a sample of participants with alcohol dependence: naltrexone, in comparison to a placebo, attenuated subjective stimulation within 10 minutes of administration of a moderate dose of alcohol, but not thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drobes |first=David J. |last2=Anton |first2=Raymond F. |last3=Thomas |first3=Suzanne E. |last4=Voronin |first4=Konstantin |date=2004-09-01 |title=Effects of Naltrexone and Nalmefene on Subjective Response to Alcohol Among Non-Treatment-Seeking Alcoholics and Social Drinkers |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |language=en |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1362–1370 |doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000139704.88862.01 |issn=1530-0277 |pmid=15365307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory studies have shown that ''OPRM1'' genotype moderates the subjective effects of naltrexone in social and heavy drinkers, such that G carriers reported reduced sensitivity to the stimulating effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, a placebo-controlled study of heavy drinkers of East Asian descent demonstrated that G carriers experienced greater sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects as compared to A homozygotes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There is limited evidence suggesting that [[quetiapine]] and [[varenicline]] increase the aversive effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Trauma Systems Therapy (TST)''' is a [[mental health]] treatment model for children and adolescents who have been exposed to [[psychological trauma|trauma]]&lt;!--intentional link to disambiguation page--&gt;, defined as experiencing, witnessing, or confronting "an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others".&lt;ref name=DSM4&gt;

Trauma Systems Therapy treatment is not just for the victims. It also educates the victims significant others in order for them to support the victims in their recovery and help them control their emotions during future stressful events.&lt;ref name=TSTWeb&gt;{{cite web|last=TST Development Team|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/tst-basics/|work=Trauma Systems Therapy: Transforming the lives of traumatized children|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to TST, therapists are looking at four categories: the reason a child may need TST, the signs and symptoms expressed by the child, the management and treatment methods and the results of children who have gone through TST. A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors.

==Reasons for Treatment==
Traumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, “TST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child’s social environment and/or systems of care”.&lt;ref name="saxe-blog"/&gt; This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe’s theory in “The March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,” begins with “survival-in-the-moment” which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;  Second, “Past memory” refers to “laying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt; This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, “marching into the future” refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child’s ability to think into the future. Saxe states, “If consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|40}} One’s ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to “calculate survival-related risk”;&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|40}} this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it.

==Diagnosis/ Signs and Symptoms==
The treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|62}} When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|62}} Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|63}} In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood.

There are three main groups used to categorize a child’s trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation);&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|65}} Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse).&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|65}} The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child’s life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|61}} We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven’t learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success.

==Management==
Management of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients.&lt;ref name=saxe-blog&gt;{{cite web|last=Saxe|first=Glenn N.|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/|publisher=Trauma Systems Blog|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of the child’s trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family.

Therapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services).&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|158}} Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST.  Next, everyone in the child’s life must become a service advocacy, which means holding “Family Collaborative Meetings”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|156}} This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children’s needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child’s emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|225}} Finally, psychopharmacology is medication used to help a person’s emotional state. To reach the best therapeutic effect for a child, all of these concepts have to be integrated. The medication approach starts with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); these help with anxiety, depression and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|212}} The second-line medications are Benzodiazepines, Tricyclic antidepressants and Antipsychotic medication. These are very strong and are used as a last-ditch effort to prevent a child from having severe emotional problems. Occasionally, sleeping medication is prescribed but all are under careful supervision for harmful side effects. TST is an ongoing process that attempts to heal the child, not band-aid the problem; thus, medication is used sparingly and patients are weaned to lower therapeutic doses over time.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|214}}

==Results==
TST patients showed a much longer committed enrollment time versus the patient in basic therapy by almost 90%.&lt;ref name=Saxe2012&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Saxe|first1=Glenn N.|last2=Heidi Ellis|first2=B.|last3=Fogler|first3=Jason|last4=Navalta|first4=Carryl P.|title=Innovations in Practice: Preliminary evidence for effective family engagement in treatment for child traumatic stress-trauma systems therapy approach to preventing dropout|journal=Child and Adolescent Mental Health|year=2012|volume=17|series=1|pages=59|doi=10.1111/j.1475-3588.2011.00626.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to success is preventing dropout; this is a long process and significant evidence-based treatment needs at least eight sessions.&lt;ref name=Saxe2012/&gt; Children with emotional trauma tend to come from substance abuse families and lower income. This makes it hard for parents to be committed to TST, particularly if they struggle with addiction or abuse themselves. Children have shown significant progress just by the one-on-one attention during TST; a child’s social environment is crucial to his or her success in treatment.  Results vary in different social levels of the country, different families and what each child has experienced and its severity.

'''WiRED International''' is a 501(c)(3)non-profit, volunteer-driven organization that has been delivering medical and health information to war-affected and underserved regions since 1997. WiRED International’s goal is to address the severe global inequality of health knowledge.

WiRED International provides health information to underdeveloped areas by delivering programs, equipment and coordinated health education. Over the years, the organization has opened facilities in 15 countries, while NGOs, medical schools and hospitals in many additional countries have adopted its programs for community health education. The organization serves remote regions and, when appropriate, supplies laptops, projectors, solar equipment and complete health education libraries.

All WiRED International’s resources online and on portable media are cost-free to users.

WiRED International’s educational programs are technology-based. Starting in the 1990s, the organization stored programs on floppy disks and CD-ROMS and today relies on the Internet and flash drives. With this technology, people can put hundreds of training programs in their pockets, to take beyond the grid. These programs can be run on portable laptops and projectors for group presentations.

In 2009, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health awarded WiRED International its Organizational Public Health Hero Award. WiRED earned the award “for its achievements in using information technology to provide up-to-date health education and medical information in developing, post-conflict, and isolated regions of the world.”

== History ==
San Francisco State University professor, Gary Selnow, Ph.D., founded WiRED International in 1997 while on a Fulbright Fellowship as a visiting professor at the [[University of Zagreb]] in Croatia right after the [[Yugoslav War]]. Selnow said, “UNICEF had donated computers to a high school in [[Vukovar]], Croatia, but they were sitting in boxes. We connected them to the Internet.”

Within two years, after formally registering as an NGO, WiRED International had established technology-based programs in six of the former Yugoslav countries. The U.S. Department of State engaged WiRED International’s services in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, where the organization’s volunteers set up community-access Internet centers to help people find family members who fled during the conflict with Serbia. Dr. Selnow noted that physicians made up “the largest group visiting the centers in Kosovo.”

As a small and flexible organization, WiRED International can respond quickly to community needs. While most of its work deals with health education, occasionally the organization comes across circumstances that merit special attention. One example took place in Kosovo in 1999, where a number of children had been unable to receive adequate treatment for life-threatening illnesses because of a war-damaged health care system.

Selnow was traveling by van from [[Pristina|Prishtina]] (Priština), Kosovo, to [[Skopje]], Macedonia, which, at the time, had the nearest operational airport. In the van was a five-year-old boy and a nurse. The nurse explained that [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] was funding the boy’s travel to France for heart surgery, but that budgets couldn’t pay for his parents to go along. “Will you go with him?” Selnow asked. “No, I’ll drop him off and someone from the hospital will meet him at [[de Gaulle Airport]].”

“So, this boy will undergo open-heart surgery without anyone to hold his hand and tell him in his Albanian language that he’ll be fine?” The nurse said, “That’s how it is, I’m sorry.”

Soon afterwards, WiRED International set up a program it called “Video Visit,” where a computer in [[Prishtina]] (Priština), where the parents remained, and a computer in the host country, where the children were being treated, could connect via the Internet. The connections allowed the parents and the children to speak on a regular basis and stay in touch during the children’s often extended treatments. WiRED International’s Video Visit wasn’t set up in time for the boy in the van, but it operated for many other children set off in the months that followed.

WiRED International’s mission became focused on medical and health education as a result of the clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health developmental grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia.
 
In spring 2003 the State Department asked Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down.
 
In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies medical and health education modules via the Internet and portable storage media. It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas.
 
In 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.

== WiRED International’s Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Information ==
In 2011, WiRED International launched a virtual [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net Center] which draws intellectual content and resources from regions of abundance, processes it for new audiences and distributes that information to regions of scarcity. This project is funded in large part by [http://philanthropy.medtronic.com/ Medtronic Philanthropy].

The WiRED International e-library of more than 300 medical and health education modules enables physicians and nurses, patients, health workers and communities to address the prevention and treatment of both infectious and non-communicable disease in developing areas of the world. The more than 300 topics as diverse as maternal health and hand washing, rheumatic heart disease and Ebola, clean water strategies and home caregiver training.

In 2014 WiRED International expanded the global reach of its programs by creating a “Filling Station.” This is a tool that provides file synchronization (or syncing), whereby a person’s computer can upload data from a master file in an automatic process that adds new or changed material. Thus, the Filling Station allows instant updating of the entire community health education (CHE) e-library from any Internet access point in the world.

With these interactive training programs, communities and medical professionals alike can educate themselves through the material released on this website and also distributed on portable media for communities off the grid.

These training modules are developed by WiRED International’s team of physicians, medical editors, imagers and technicians along with a host of other medical experts. The team continually updates the existing material and creates new modules to provide a rich source of health information.

When a community health crisis occurs, WiRED International speeds the creation of a rapid response module and translates it into appropriate languages. Examples include: 
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-ebola.html Ebola] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/58-fr/story.html French])
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-malnutrition.html Severe Malnutrition] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/121-ab/story.html Arabic])
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-polio.html Polio] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/117-ab/story.html Arabic] and [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/117-ar/story.html Armenian])
