'''Western Esotericism''' is an [[academic field]] of [[research]], [[scholarship]], and [[education]] that focuses on the history of [[Europe]]an and [[Western esotericism]].

==Origins and development==
The academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that &amp;ndash; although it had been ignored by previous scholarship &amp;ndash; the impact which pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought had exerted on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=4}} One of the key centres for this was the [[Warburg Institute]] in London, where scholars like [[Frances Yates]], [[Edgar Wind]], Ernst Cassier, and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater impact on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|pp=4–5}} In 1965, the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] in the [[Sorbonne]], Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was [[François Secret]], a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} In 1979 the scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the "History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=x}} Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=5}}

Faivre noted that there were two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was that there was an engrained prejudice towards esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} The second was that esotericism is a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it "participates in all these fields" it does not squarely fit into any of them.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|pp=1–2}} 

In 1980, the U.S.-based [[Hermetic Academy]] was founded by [[Robert A. McDermott]] as an outlet for scholars interested in Western esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]] under the rubric of the "Esotericism and Perennialism Group".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented the fact that it had not done so in Germany.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}}
By 2008, there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, at the [[University of Sorbonne]], [[University of Amsterdam]], and the [[University of Exeter]], with the latter two institutions also offering [[master's degree]] programs in it.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=3}}

On the basis of the fact that "English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism", in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that [[English studies]] also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.{{sfn|Brînzeu|Szönyi|2011|p=184}}

==Schools==
The following Universities have academic chairs in the subject:
* [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands
* [[École pratique des hautes études]] in France

Specific degrees that can be granted include:
* [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[MRes]] in Religious Studies: Mysticism &amp; Western Esotericism track, from University of Amsterdam
* [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[MRes]] in Concealed Knowledge: Gnosticism, Esotericism and Mysticism, from the University of Groningen, Netherlands.
* [[PhD]] in Religious Studies: Mysticism, Gnosticism &amp; Esotericism Concentration, from Rice University.

The '''Association of Environmental Professionals''' (AEP) is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization of [[interdisciplinary]] professionals including [[environmental science]], [[resource management]], [[environmental planning]] and other professions contributing to this field.  AEP is the first organization of its kind in the USA, and its influence and model have spawned numerous other regional organizations throughout the United States, as well as the separate [[National Association of Environmental Professionals]] (NAEP).  Its mission is to improve the technical skills of members, and the organization is dedicated to "the enhancement, maintenance and protection of the natural and human environment".  From inception in the mid-1970s the organization has been closely linked with the upkeep of the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA), California being one of the first states to adopt a comprehensive law to govern the environmental review of public policy and project review.

==History, organization and governance==

AEP was incorporated in the State of California in 1975 and held its first organization wide meeting of members in [[Palo Alto]], California on the [[Stanford University]] campus.  At that meeting the first directors and officers were elected and [[by-laws]] adopted.  From then on the board of directors has met quarterly to establish governance, coordinate legislative liassion and plan annual meeting.  The board represents eight geographical regions and also has three at large members.

==Publications and member activities==

AEP publishes a quarterly magazine, the [[Environmental Monitor]], which contains technical articles, [[legislative]] updates and other information useful to its members.  As mentioned above the organization has developed a skilled legislative [[advocacy]] program, which is remarkable in its pursuit of clarity of language, efficient functioning of environmental review and ethical goals for its profession.  AEP also provides annual recognition awards for excellence in various categories, provides members with information on career development and works to achieve standards for performance in the environmental disciplines.

The Environmental Monitor magazine is recognized throughout the interdisciplinary professions as a leading source of state of the art coverage.  Articles may include topics of [[air quality]], [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] conservation, [[water quality]], [[archaeology]], [[urban planning]], [[acoustics]] and other technical matters; however coverage is also given to legislation, AEP activities and professional career development.

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Monumental axis.jpg|thumb| Design of [[Brasília]] – influenced by The Athens Charter]]
The '''Athens Charter''' ({{lang-fr|Charte d'Athènes}}) was a 1933 document about [[urban planning]] published by the Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The work was based upon Le Corbusier’s ''[[Ville Radieuse]]'' (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) in the early 1930s.

The Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for [[Athens]] from [[Marseilles]]. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: "Architects' Congress."

The Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II.

==Background==

Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the [[Ville Contemporaine]] in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform.

Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in [[Brussels]] in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=118}}

==The Functional City==

The concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in [[Zürich]] in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Siegfried Giedion]], Rudolf Steiger and [[Werner M. Moser]] discussed with [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in [[Moscow]] in 1933.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=59}} The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=25}}

Van Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=60}}

At a special congress meeting in [[Berlin]] later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of [[Amsterdam]]. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp=61-63}}

In 1932 Le Corbusier's [[Palace of the Soviets]] competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp71-72}}

==CIAM 4==

The fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=121}}

The national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Zürich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}}

On arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}} The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles.

During meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=85}} Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: ''observations'' and ''resolutions''.

==The Athens Charter==
[[File:Highpoint detail.jpg|thumb|Highpoint 1 by Berthold Lubetkin]]
The ''observations'' taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=173}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks.

-Mumford, 2000, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions.

The ''observations'' formed the basis of [[Josep Lluís Sert|Josep Lluís Sert's]] book ''Can our cities survive?'' and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's ''Athens Charter'' published in 1943. The ''resolutions'' formed part of Le Corbusier's book ''The Radiant City'' published in 1935.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=90}}

The text of the ''Athens Charter'' as published became an extension of the content of ''The Radiant City''{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=208}} and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original ''observations''. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the ''observations'' that were founded before on concrete references.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=156}} Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiv.gta.arch.ethz.ch/research/ciam-4-the-functional-city|title=Research Project — CIAM 4. The Functional City — gta Archives — Institute gta — ETH Zurich|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-war influence==
[[File:Rotterdam van nelle fabriek.jpg|thumb|Van Nelle Factory, Netherlands]]
The CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=77}}

After ''The Radiant City'' was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=91}}

In the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the [[Van Nelle Factory|Van Nelle factory]] designed in part by [[Mart Stam]] that was to have formed a larger part of a ''Functional City'' design.

CIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential [[MARS Group]] from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and his practice, the [[Tecton Group]] completed  [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]] in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings.{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=94}}

In 1937 with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities.

==Post-war influence==

The ''Athens Charter'' had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=120}} However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the ''Charter'' with a different ''Charter of Habitat''.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=268}}

===France===
[[File:Corbusierhaus B-Westend 06-2017.jpg|thumb|The Unité d'Habitation in Marseille]]
In 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in [[La Rochelle]] and St Dié. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the ''Charter'', but as part of the project he proposed eight [[Unité d'Habitation]] flanked by a civic centre.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=163}} Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unités resulted in one being built. In line with the ''Charter'', the Unité was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1999}} It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=172}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Alton Estate Roehampton London.jpg|thumb|High rises part of the Alton Estate]]
[[File:Parkhill2.jpg|thumb|Parkhill Estate, Sheffield]]
The 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for [[Local government|Local Authorities]] to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer [[James Maude Richards|J M Richards]] praised Le Corbusier's Unité for "putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=8-10}}

Between 1952 and 1958 [[London County Council]] built the [[Alton Estate|Alton East]] and Alton West high-rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been [[Listed building|listed]].{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=147-149}}

In Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill Estate]]. The product of an entire [[slum clearance]], three times the size of the Unité, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and [[milk float]]s.{{sfnp|Banham|1978|pp=141-143}} Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. [[Harold Macmillan]] said it would "draw the admiration of the world".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=13}}

In Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The ''Functional City'' prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the [[Gorbals|Hutchesontown Gorbals]] area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect [[Robert Matthew]] designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns.{{sfnp|MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie|1999|pp=105-108}}

The [[Golden Lane Estate|Golden Lane]] London, was designed by [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unité it has a terrace on the roof.

The Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the ''Functional City'', renaming them ''House'', ''Street'', ''District'' and ''City''. In the Golden Lane development the ''House'' became the family unit, the ''Street'' was an elevated access deck but the ''District'' and ''City'' lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book "Urban Structuring".

===The Americas===
[[File:Esplanadabsb12.jpg|thumb|Ministers Esplanade in Brasília]]
[[Lúcio Costa|Lúcio Costa's]] conception of the plan for [[Brasília]] saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=226}}

In a variation of the ''Functional City'', Sert designed married-student housing for [[Harvard University]] in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=292}}

===The rest of the world===

In Japan in 1957, [[Kunio Maekawa]] designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unité. Meanwhile, In [[Tel Aviv]] in 1963 CIAM member [[Jacob B. Bakema]] designed a ''Functional City'' proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme.

==Criticism==
[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|[[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri]]
The [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the ''Functional City''. It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. [[Charles Jencks]] proclaimed that the death of [[Modern Architecture]] was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite.{{sfnp|Jencks|1978|p=9}}

Architectural critic [[Reyner Banham]] was concerned that the supposed universality of the ''Charter'' concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing.{{sfnp|Curtis|1991|p=208}}

In planning terms the ''Charter'' had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=288}}

Even by 1954 during the [[Aix-en-Provence]] meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of [[Team 10|Team X]] at the [[Dubrovnik]] meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=287}}

In the case of Brasília, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban [[utopia]] became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=228}} In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a [[Kafkaesque]] Nightmare with an [[Orwellian]] environment.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=247}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The imitations of the Unité usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous variations?

−Curtis, 1986, Modern Architecture since 1900, Phaidon, p293
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent history==
In 2003 the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] wrote a new version of the Charter.

==Trivia==

[[J. G. Ballard|J. G. Ballard's]] book [[High Rise (novel)|''High Rise'']] is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.

A '''Biblical [[genre]]''' is a classification of Bible literature according to [[literary genre]]. The genre of a particular [[Bible]] passage is ordinarily identified by analysis of its general writing style, [[setting tone|tone]], form, structure, [[literary technique]], content, design, and related linguistic factors; texts that exhibit a common set of literary features (very often in keeping with the writing styles of the times in which they were written) are together considered to be belonging to a genre. In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the [[Book of Revelation]] is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).

Within the discipline of literary analysis, the existence and subjectivity of genres is a matter of some debate. This is reflected to a lesser degree in academic discussion of Biblical genres. However, isolating the broad genres of the Bible and discerning which books/passages belong to which genre is not a matter of complete agreement; for instance, scholars diverge over the existence and features of such Bible genres as [[gospel]] and [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]]. Furthermore, some detect subgenres&amp;mdash;more narrowly defined compositional categories within a genre&amp;mdash;in surrounding historical literature, and speculate that certain books and passages of the Bible may be better denominated by subgenre (e.g., it may be claimed that the book of Philemon is not simply a generic letter, but a ''personal'' letter). Despite such differences of opinion within the community of Bible scholars, the majority acknowledge that the concept of genre and subgenre can be useful in the study of the Bible as a guide to the tone and interpretation of the text.

By way of literary comparison with the Bible, the Qur'an is claimed to be a recitation by Allah to the prophet Muhammed in didactic form, and so does not have the degree of genre diversity that is evidenced in the Bible; although there is a difference in style and themes between the Meccan surrahs and the Medinan surrahs when Muhammed moved from Mecca to Medina. In contrast, the Bible is claimed to be inspired by a supreme being and organically written and compiled by many authors over a very long period of time, and so takes a wide variety of forms.

==Genres in the Bible==
Among the generally recognized genres and categorizations of the Bible are the following (note that other systems and classifications have also been advanced):
* Historical narrative/epic: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the first half of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], 1 and 2 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], 1 and 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]], 1 and 2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], and possibly [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]
* The Law: the last half of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]; also [[Leviticus]], [[Deuteronomy]]
* Wisdom: [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]]
* Psalms: [[Psalms]], [[Song of Solomon]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]]
* Prophecy: [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Hosea]], [[Book of Joel|Joel]], [[Book of Amos|Amos]], [[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]], [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], [[Book of Micah|Micah]], [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]], [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]], [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]]
* Apocalypse: [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]
* Gospel: [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]], and possibly [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]
* Epistle (letter): [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], 1 and 2 [[Epistles to the Corinthians (disambiguation)|Corinthians]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], [[Ephesians]], [[Philippians]], [[Colossians]], 1 and 2 [[Epistles to the Thessalonians (disambiguation)|Thessalonians]], 1 and 2 [[First Epistle to Timothy|Timothy]], [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]], [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]], [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], [[Epistle of James|James]], 1 and 2 [[Epistle of Peter (disambiguation)|Peter]], 1, 2, and 3 [[Epistles of John|John]], [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]]

'''Caucasology''', or '''Caucasiology''' refers to the [[history|historical]] and [[geopolitical]] studies of [[Caucasus]] region. The branch has more than 150 years history. In 1972, the Caucasiological Center (renamed to International Caucasiological Center in 2000) was founded under the auspices of the [[Israel President]] [[Zalman Shazar]].

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customer value maximization''' ('''CVM''') is a real-time service model that, proponents say, goes beyond basic [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) capabilities, identifying and capturing maximum potential from prospects and existing customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799019107|title=Superior customer value/ Buch.|date=2012|publisher=CRC|isbn=9781439861288|oclc=799019107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that a well-devised CVM program helps companies offer the right things to the right people at the right time. The CVM framework uses creative, technology, media and process along with robust measurement systems to help marketers maximize returns from their marketing investments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Customer-centricity ==

* Customer interactions with brands have become more layered/complex due to electronic channels of communication – Digital, Mobile, and Social-Internet.
* Hyper competition and multiplicity of messages have severely impaired customer attention
* Analytics and technology can be applied to address consumer behavior challenges
* Marketing is forced to demonstrate accountability
* Lack of human interaction with customers leads to inability to "close the sale"

These factors have made it imperative for marketing organizations to find new mechanisms to generate value from each customer interaction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Customer value maximization shifts focus from managing products or marketing campaigns to managing the profitability of individual customers over the life of the relationship. While CVM may lead to better product offerings and more targeted campaigns, a customer value manager asks different questions compared to a traditional [[marketing manager]].
Instead of asking who will respond to a 10% off promotion, a customer value manager strives to understand who the customer is and what they can offer to increase the customer's lifetime value?

The CVM framework evaluates current methods and effectiveness, makes changes where required, and sets up a measurement system that helps in evaluating effectiveness. The CVM framework operates as a continuous process in a closed loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300310255|title=Superior customer value in the new economy concepts and cases|last=Art.|first=Weinstein,|last2=Art.|first2=Weinstein,|date=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0203501497|oclc=300310255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing scenario ==

Today customers own the on and off switches to all media/mediums, are more knowledgeable about various products and services they are being marketed to and have very limited attention spans owing to existing clutter. The remote, so to speak, is now unmistakably in the customers' hands. Most marketers have realized that traditional methods of marketing simply don’t work in this new milieu. They are today actively seeking, investing and mastering newer methods and tools that go beyond making their brands merely visible to ones that allow better consumer understanding, precise targeting, customized offering and above all that which engage and let them have a two-way conversation with their customers. For the progressive marketer, the real challenge begins from this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/64996/financial-marketing-trends-technology-media-cmo/|title=Financial Marketers Not Ready For The Future|date=2017-04-24|work=The Financial Brand|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing challenges ==

Marketing challenges can be predominantly dissected into 4 categories:

* '''Lifecycle challenges''' include driving usage of a product/service, new client acquisition, enabling cross-sell, up-sell, client retention, activation, usage, preventing [[Churn rate|churn]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1965/11/exploit-the-product-life-cycle|title=Exploit the Product Life Cycle|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Segment-based challenges''' Companies have the need to reach out to each customer in a different way suiting their needs and this is all the more the case when the company has multiple products/product variants. They need to reach out in a focused manner to independent segments that require varying strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/b2b-segmentation-research/|title=Market Segmentation in B2B Markets {{!}} B2B Segmentation|work=B2B International|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel-based challenges''' Most companies adopt a multi-channel strategy in order to take their products or services to their customers. Each channel- be it a store, online, mobile etc. needs to be tackled in a different way to ensure maximization of results. In addition to this channel, cannibalization should also not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33820/5-major-challenges-marketers-face-and-how-to-solve-them.aspx#sm.000o4u5vs14d1d24qtf12erw39363|title=7 of the Top Marketing Challenges Marketers Face Today [New Data]|last=Kolowich|first=Lindsay|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Function-based challenges''' When companies invest in marketing programs they look for methods that help them evaluate and track how it works and to measure [[Return on investment|ROI]]. Systems to manage their programs, maximize results and optimize spends are all that companies keep looking for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/7-big-problems-marketing.aspx|title=7 Big Problems in the Marketing Industry|website=www.ama.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What organizations need from their marketing programs ==

The intended outcome of marketing investments may be

* [[Customer acquisition management|Drive acquisition]]
* Influence [[Conversion rate|conversion]]
* Produce revenues – directly or indirectly
* [[Cross-selling|Cross-sell]], [[Upselling|Up-sell]]
* Reduce [[Churn rate|Churn]]

The actual outcomes, however, happen to be

* Traffic to website
* Conversations on social media
* Views of online videos
* Calls to 1800 numbers
* Walk-ins to physical outlets

== Benefits ==

* Takes customer view of all marketing programs and integrates them to deliver value.
* Brings [[Marketing accountability|accountability]] to marketing programs.
* Helps map marketing goals to business goals.
* Helps identify the right marketing channel and tool mix.
* Small interventions in marketing programs to create significant change.

== Features ==

* X-ray marketing programs.
* Evaluate their effectiveness.
* Re-architect them according to goals.
* Augment Measurement System.
* Grow value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey%20offices/spain/pdfs/driving_intelligent_growth.ashx|title=Driving Intelligent Growth with Customer Value Maximization|last=Anna|first=Fiorentino|date=December 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== When this becomes critical ==

* Whenever the marketing team needs to demonstrate the accountability of spends or measurability of returns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Increase yield from current customer-facing programs, channels or product lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Align and optimize [[customer engagement]] on [[digital media|digital]], 1-1 and [[social media]] to overarching brand and business objectives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Versus CRM ==

[[Customer relationship management]] facilitates deepening of relationships with existing customers using database marketing techniques. Customer value maximization, on the other hand, is used to maximize value for both existing and prospective customers and follows a multi-disciplinary approach. Customer value maximization may or may not require [[relationship marketing]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:De Re Aedificatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of 1550 edition, [[Florence]]]]

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''Münchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

==Book==
[[File:L'architettura (1565) (14758258226).jpg|thumb|Plate from a 1565 edition, showing the plan of a [[basilica]]]]
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art}}

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings— "temples" in his phrase—Alberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

'''Dendrochronology'''  (or '''tree-ring dating''') is the [[scientific method]] of [[chronological dating|dating]] tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history.

Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old [[panel painting]]s on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in [[radiocarbon dating]] to calibrate radiocarbon ages.&lt;ref name=Grissino&gt;{{cite|title=The Science of Tree Rings: Principles of Dendrochronology|first=Henri D.|last=Grissino-Mayer|publisher=Department of Geography, The University of Tennessee|date=n.d.|url=http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|accessdate=October 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104042215/http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New growth in [[tree]]s occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.&lt;ref name=Grissino /&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimer |first1=Paula J. |year=2013 |title=IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0–50,000 years cal BP |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=55 |pages=1869–1887 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16947 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516010345/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrochronology derives from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:δένδρον|δένδρον]]}} (''{{lang|la|dendron}}''), meaning "tree", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}} (''{{lang|la|khronos}}''), meaning "time", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''({{lang|la|[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]}}''), "the study of".

== History ==
The Greek botanist [[Theophrastus]] (ca. 371 – ca. 287 BC) first mentioned that the wood of trees has rings.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus with Arthur Hort, trans., ''Enquiry into Plants'', volume 1 (London, England: William Heinemann, 1916), Book V, [https://archive.org/stream/enquiryintoplant01theouoft#page/422/mode/2up p. 423.] From p. 423: "Moreover, the wood of the silver-fir has many layers, like an onion; there is always another beneath that which is visible, and the wood is composed of such layers throughout." Although many sources claim that Theophrastus recognized that trees form growth rings annually, this is not true.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the history of dendrochronology, see:

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the scientific study of tree rings and the application of dendrochronology began. In 1859, the German-American [[Jacob Kuechler]] (1823–1893) used crossdating to examine [[oak]]s (''[[Quercus stellata]]'') in order to study the record of climate in western Texas.&lt;ref&gt;See:

During the first half of the 20th century, the astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] founded the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]] at the [[University of Arizona]]. Douglass sought to better understand cycles of sunspot activity and reasoned that changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth, which would subsequently be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns (''i.e.'', sunspots → climate → tree rings).

[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of [[wood]] is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots, to form a growth ring.]]
Horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] cut through the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] can reveal growth rings, also referred to as ''tree rings'' or ''annual rings''. Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the [[season]]s of the year; thus, critical for the title method, one ring generally marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Removal of the bark of the tree in a particular area may cause deformation of the rings as the plant overgrows the scar.

The rings are more visible in trees which have grown in [[temperate zone]]s, where the seasons differ more markedly. The inner portion of a growth ring forms early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as "early wood" (or "spring wood", or "late-spring wood"&lt;ref&gt;"Early wood" is used in preference to "spring wood", as the latter term may not correspond to that time of year in climates where early wood is formed in the early summer (e.g. [[Canada]]) or in autumn, as in some [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] species.&lt;/ref&gt;); the outer portion is the "late wood" (sometimes termed "summer wood", often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is denser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv |last= Capon |first= Brian|title= Botany for Gardeners |year= 2005 |pages= 66–67 |edition= 2nd |isbn= 0-88192-655-8 |publisher= Timber Publishing|location= Portland, OR}} {{better source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pinus taeda crossx7358.JPG|thumb|right|240px|''[[Pinus taeda]]'' Cross section showing annual rings, [[Cheraw, South Carolina]].]]
Many trees in temperate zones produce one growth-ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring, while a drought year may result in a very narrow one.

Direct reading of tree ring chronologies is a complex science, for several reasons. First, contrary to the single-ring-per-year paradigm, alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid-summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. In addition, particular tree-species may present "missing rings", and this influences the selection of trees for study of long time-spans. For instance, missing rings are rare in oak and [[elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;The only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".{{cite web | url = http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | title= Useful Tree Species for Tree-Ring Dating | author= Lori Martinez | year= 1996 | publisher= | location= | accessdate= 2008-11-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108094321/http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | archivedate= 2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical to the science, trees from the same region tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period of chronological study. Researchers can compare and match these patterns  ring-for-ring with patterns from trees which have grown at the same time in the same geographical zone (and therefore under similar climatic conditions). When one can match these tree-ring patterns across successive trees in the same locale, in overlapping fashion, chronologies can be built up—both for entire geographical regions and for sub-regions. Moreover, wood from ancient structures with known chronologies can be matched to the tree-ring data (a technique called ''cross-dating''), and the age of the wood can thereby be determined precisely. Dendrochronologists originally carried out cross-dating by visual inspection; more recently, they have harnessed computers to do the task, applying statistical techniques to assess the matching. To eliminate individual variations in tree-ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree-ring widths of multiple tree-samples to build up a '''ring history''', a process termed replication. A tree-ring history whose beginning- and end-dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching a section against another chronology (tree-ring history) whose dates are known.

[[File:Annual growth of the wood (second typical form of the growth function).jpg|thumb|A typical form of the function of the wood ring (in accordance with the dendrochronological equation)  with an increase in the width of wood ring at initial stage.]]

Dendrochronological equation defines the law of growth of tree rings.
The equation was proposed by Russian biophysicist Alexandr N. Tetearing in his work "Theory of populations" &lt;ref name=Tetearing2012&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Alexandr N. Tetearing
 |title=Theory of populations |year=2012 |page=583 |isbn=978-1-365-56080-4 |publisher=SSO Foundation |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{k_v\, \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} \, \frac{d\big(M^{\tfrac{1}{3}}(t)\big)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; is width of annual ring, &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time (in years), &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density of wood, &lt;math&gt; k_v &lt;/math&gt; is some coefficient, &lt;math&gt; M(t) &lt;/math&gt; is function of mass growth of the tree.

With the neglection of natural sinusoidal oscillations in tree mass,
the formula of the changes in the annual ring width is:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = -\dfrac{ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t} }{3 k_v \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}} (c_4+ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t})^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

There &lt;math&gt; c_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c_4 &lt;/math&gt; are some coefficients, &lt;math&gt; a_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2 &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

The formula is useful for correct approximation of samples data before data normalization procedure.

The typical forms of the function &lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) &lt;/math&gt; of annual growth of wood ring are  shown in the figures.

== Sampling and dating ==
Dendrochronology makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfrew Colin |author2=Bahn Paul |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=144–5 |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are often represented as estimated calendar years [[before present|B.P.]], for before present, where "present" refers to 1 January 1950.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

Timber core samples are sampled and used to measure the width of annual growth rings; by taking samples from different sites within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence. The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent). In addition, some genera of trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. For instance, the [[bristlecone pine]] is exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, and has been used extensively for chronologies; still-living and dead specimens of this species provide tree-ring patterns going back thousands of years, in some regions more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |title=Bibliography of Dendrochronology |publisher=ETH Forest Snow and Landscape Research |location=Switzerland |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804005355/http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}{{specify|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the maximum span for fully anchored chronology is a little over 11,000 years B.P.

In 2004 a new [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon calibration curve]], INTCAL04, was internationally ratified to provide calibrated dates back to 26,000 [[Before Present|B.P.]] For the period back to 12,400 B.P., the radiocarbon dates are calibrated against dendrochronological dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |title=INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon age calibration, 0–26 cal kyr BP |author1=Reimer Paula J |author2=Baillie Mike GL |author3=Bard Edouard |author4=Bayliss Alex |author5=Beck J Warren |author6=Bertrand Chanda JH |author7=Blackwell Paul G |author8=Buck Caitlin E |author9=Burr George S |author10=Cutler Kirsten B |author11=Damon Paul E |author12=Edwards R Lawrence |author13=Fairbanks Richard G |author14=Friedrich Michael |author15=Guilderson Thomas P |author16=Hogg Alan G |author17=Hughen Konrad |author18=Kromer Bernd |author19=McCormac Gerry |author20=Manning Sturt |author21=Ramsey Christopher Bronk |author22=Reimer Ron W |author23=Remmele Sabine |author24=Southon John R |author25=Stuiver Minze |author26=Talamo Sahra |author27=Taylor FW |author28=van der Plicht Johannes |author29=Weyhenmeyer Constanze E |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=1029–58 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630151251/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/4167 |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fairbanks |first=Richard |title=Current Research: Radiocarbon Calibration |url=http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |work=Columbia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825132650/http://radiocarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/radiocarbon.htm |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendrochronology practice faces many obstacles, including the existence of [[species]] of [[ant]]s that inhabit [[tree]]s and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

== Reference sequences ==
European chronologies derived from wooden structures initially found it difficult to bridge the gap in the 14th century when there was a building hiatus, which coincided with the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=A Slice Through Time
 |author=[[Mike Baillie|Baillie Mike]]
 |page=124
 |year=1997
 |isbn=978-0-7134-7654-5
 |publisher=Batsford
 |location=London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there do exist unbroken chronologies dating back to prehistoric times, for example the Danish chronology dating back to 352 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |website=skalk.dk |title=WM Trædatering |language=da |trans-title=WM Tree dating |accessdate=15 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221121805/http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a sample of wood, the variation of the tree-ring growths provides not only a match by year, it can also match location because the climate across a continent is not consistent. This makes it possible to determine the source of ships as well as smaller artifacts made from wood but which were transported long distances, such as panels for paintings and ship timbers.

== Applications ==

=== Radiocarbon dating calibration ===
Dates from dendrochronology can be used as a [[calibration]] and check of [[radiocarbon dating]]&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

=== Climatology ===
{{Main|dendroclimatology}}

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s primarily from the properties of the annual tree rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/~sheppard/Raul/DendroclimatologyReview.pdf |title=Dendroclimatology: extracting climate from trees |first=Paul R. |last=Sheppard |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.]] |journal=WIREs Clim Change  |year=May-June 2010 |volume=1 |page=343-352 |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

=== Art history ===
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, determined to date from the 16th century by dendrochronology.]]

Dendrochronology has become important to art historians in the dating of [[panel painting]]s. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf English Heritage Guide to Dendrochronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063338/http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s have turned out to be painted on panels of "Baltic oak" shipped from the [[Vistula]] region via ports of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk, Ron, ''More than Meets the Eye: An Introduction to Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Paintings at the Fogg Art Museum'', Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 1, Autumn, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of seasoned wood were used, an uncertain number of years has to be allowed for seasoning when estimating dates.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ian Kuniholm, [http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf ''Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230735/http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }} Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; Panels were trimmed of the outer rings, and often each panel only uses a small part of the [[radius]] of the trunk. Consequently, dating studies usually result in a "[[terminus post quem]]" (earliest possible) date, and a tentative date for the actual arrival of a seasoned raw panel using assumptions as to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. Stanley |last1=Taft |first2=James W. |last2=Mayer |first3=Richard |last3=Newman |first4=Peter Ian |last4=Kuniholm |first5=Dusan |last5=Stulik |title=The Science of Paintings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98722-4 |chapter=Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings |chapterurl=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/painttex.html |pages=206–215 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422142755/https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |archivedate=2017-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of establishing numerous sequences, it was possible to date 85–90% of the 250 paintings from the 14th to 17th century analysed between 1971 and 1982;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, John, ''Panel Examination and Dendrochronology'' The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; by now a much greater number have been analysed.

A portrait of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] was believed to be an 18th-century copy. However, dendrochronology revealed that the wood dated from the second half of the 16th century. It is now regarded as an original 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots#dendro National Portrait gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017160354/http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dendrochronology was applied to four paintings depicting the same subject, that of [[Cleansing of the Temple|Christ expelling the money-lenders from the Temple]]. The results showed that the age of the wood was too late for any of them to have been painted by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 Tree Rings, the barcodes of Nature illuminate art history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043013/http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 |date=2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many panel paintings were transferred onto canvas or other supports during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Building history ===
The dating of buildings with wooden structures and components has also been done by using dendrochronology. While archaeologists can date wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure in which the wood was used; the wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood. The dating of building via dendrochronology thus requires knowledge of the history of building technology.&lt;ref name=sawyer1993&gt;{{cite book |title= Medieval Scandinavia: from conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500 |first1= Peter |last1= Sawyer |authorlink1= Peter Sawyer (historian) |first2= Birgit |last2= Sawyer |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |series= The Nordic Series |volume= 17 |year= 1993 |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-8166-1739-5 |oclc= 489584487 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518110748/https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate= 2015-05-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] in Dedham, Massachusetts. While the house had long been claimed to have been built circa 1640 (and being the oldest wood-framed house in North America), core samples of wood taken from a summer beam confirmed the wood was from an oak tree felled in 1637–8. An additional sample from another beam yielded a date of 1641, thus confirming the house had been constructed starting in 1638 and finished sometime after 1641 as wood was not seasoned before use in building at that time in New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand House in 17th-Century New England|url=http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|publisher=Fairbanks House Historical Site|accessdate=May 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316053504/http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related chronologies ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Similar seasonal patterns also occur in [[ice core]]s and in [[varve]]s (layers of [[sediment]] deposition in a lake, river, or sea bed). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake, and with the fineness of the sediment.

Some columnar [[cactus]] also exhibit similar seasonal patterns in the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in their spines ([[acanthochronology]]). These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the range of the seasonal data available to archaeologists and [[paleoclimatologist]]s.

A similar technique is used to [[Estimating the age of fish|estimate the age of fish]] stocks through the analysis of growth rings in the [[otolith]] bones.

The concept was originally developed in the field of [[biology]], later in [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[architecture]].  

In [[architecture]], it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko (2000). 'Digital Morphogenesis and Computational Architectures', in ''Proceedings of the 4th Conference of Congreso Iberoamericano de Grafica Digital, SIGRADI 2000 - Construindo (n)o Espaço Digital (Constructing the Digital Space)'', Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 25–28 September 2000, ed. by José Ripper Kós, Andréa Pessoa Borde and Diana Rodriguez Barros, pp. 98-103 [http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/4077.content.pdf]

Parallels can be seen in [[emergence|emergent properties]] and [[self-organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

'''Dittography''' is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Wegner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIMsY6b2n2gC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A student's guide to textual criticism of the Bible: its history, methods, and results''], InterVarsity Press, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in the field of [[textual criticism]]. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on, is known as [[haplography]].

==Example==
[[Papyrus 98|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;]] in Rev 1:13 has {{lang|el|περιεζωσμμενον}} instead of {{lang|el|περιεζωσμενον}} (doubled μ). [[Codex Vaticanus]]  in John 13:14 word {{lang|el|διδασκαλος}} is repeated twice. In Codex Vaticanus in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], a book of the [[Bible]], verse 19:34, the phrase "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" appears twice while it only appears once in other manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/dittography.html Dittography—earlham.edu/~seidti]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embodied music cognition''' is a direction within [[systematic musicology]] interested in studying the role of the human body in relation to all musical activities.

It considers the human body as the natural mediator between mind (focused on musical intentions, meanings, significations) and physical environment (containing musical sound and other types of energy that affords human action).

== Introduction ==
Given the impact of body movement on musical meaning formation and signification, the musical mind is said to be embodied. [[Embodied philosophy|Embodiment]]  assumes that what happens in the mind is depending on properties of the body, such as kinaesthetic properties.

Embodied music cognition tends to see music perception as based on action. For example, many people move when they listen to music. Through movement, it is assumed that people give meaning to music. This type of meaning-formation is corporeal, rather than cerebral because it is understood through the body. This is different from a disembodied approach to music cognition, which sees musical meaning as being based on a perception-based analysis of musical structure. The embodied grounding of music perception is based on a multi-modal encoding of auditory information and on principles that ensure the coupling of perception and action.

During the last decade, research in embodied music cognition 
has been strongly motivated by a demand for new tools in view of the interactive possibilities offered by digital media technology.

With the advent of powerful computing tools, and in particular real-time interactive music systems, gradually more attention has been devoted to the role of gesture in music. This [[musical gestures]] research has been rather influential in that it puts more emphasis on
sensorimotor feedback and integration, as well as on the coupling
of perception and action. With new sensor technology, gesture-based research has meanwhile become a vast domain of music research, with consequences for the methodological and [[epistemological]] foundations of music cognition research.

==Method==
The scientific apparatus draws upon an empirical and evidence-based methodology, which is based on measurement of sound (via audio-recording), human movement (via video-recording, kinematic recording), human biology (via bioparameter-recording) and [[semantics]] (via questionnaires). Using a scientific apparatus for measurement, statistical analysis and computational modelling, embodied music cognition aims to build up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in meaning formation.

==Applications==
Research in embodied music cognition has a strong connection with technology development, more particularly, in fields related to interactive music systems, and music information retrieval. Mediation technology is the technology by which the human body, and consequently also the human mind, can be given an extension in the digital musical domain.

==How it is distinct from (disembodied) music cognition==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] had a tremendous impact on cognitive science and in particular on cognitive musicology.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Influenced by [[Gestalt psychology]], [[music cognition]] research of the last decades of the 20th Century was mainly focusing on the perception of structure, that is, the perception of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]. It considered music perception as a faculty on its own, completely dissociated from musical action.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Instead, in studies on embodied musical activity (such as listening and music performance), subjects are invited to actively engage in the [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] process. This engagement is articulated by means of corporeal expression which can be measured, analyzed, modelled and related to the musical stimulus. [[René Descartes]]' idea that mental activity is of a separate order from body movement is refuted and, in fact reversed.

==How it is distinct from traditional musicology==
The difference with the traditional phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches to musical meaning formation is that embodied music cognition has a focus on an empirical and evidence-based methodology, rather than on subjective first-person descriptions. Embodied music cognition aims at giving a full account of the subjective involvement by taking into account the role of the social-cultural context, subjective background (involving gender, age, familiarity with music, degree of music education).

Embodied music cognition adopts a scientific methodology but its aim is not to reduce music to physics, nor to reduce gesture and embodied meaning to the biomechanics of the human body. Instead, embodied music cognition fully recognizes the contribution of all mental and bodily systems including subjective feelings, emotions and coinaesthetic (or body image) awareness.

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental governance''' is a concept in [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]] that advocates [[sustainability]] ([[sustainable development]]) as the supreme consideration for [[Management|managing]] all human activities—[[Politics|political]], [[social]] and [[Economy|economic]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8. The Soft Path in a Nutshell. (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Governance includes government, business and civil society, and emphasizes whole [[Systems management|system management]]. To capture this diverse range of elements, environmental governance often employs alternative systems of governance, for example watershed-based management.&lt;ref&gt;IPlanet U, R. Michael M'Gonigle, Justine Starke&lt;/ref&gt;

It views [[natural resource]]s and the environment as global [[public goods]], belonging to the category of [[goods]] that are not diminished when they are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/analyse/fiche-analyse-317.html Launay, Claire, Mouriès, Thomas, '' Les différentes catégories de biens '', summary and excerpt from Pierre Calame’s book, ’’La démocratie en miettes’’, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that everyone benefits from for example, a breathable [[atmosphere]], stable [[climate]] and stable [[biodiversity]].

Public goods are non-rivalrous—a natural resource enjoyed by one person can still be enjoyed by others—and non-excludable—it is impossible to prevent someone consuming the good (breathing). Nevertheless, public goods are recognized as beneficial and therefore have value. The notion of a global public good thus emerges, with a slight distinction: it covers necessities that must not be destroyed by one person or state.

The non-rivalrous character of such goods calls for a management approach that restricts public and private actors from damaging them. One approach is to attribute an [[economic value]] to the resource. [[Water]] is possibly the best example of this type of good.

As of 2013 environmental governance is far from meeting these imperatives. “Despite a great awareness of environmental questions from [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], there is [[environmental degradation]] and the appearance of new environmental problems. This situation is caused by the parlous state of global environmental governance, wherein current global environmental governance is unable to address environmental issues due to many factors. These include fragmented governance within the [[United Nations]], lack of involvement from financial institutions, proliferation of environmental agreements often in conflict with [[trade]] measures; all these various problems disturb the proper functioning of global environmental governance. Moreover, divisions among northern countries and the persistent gap between developed and developing countries also have to be taken into account to comprehend the institutional failures of the current global environmental governance."

==Definitions==
'''What is Environmental Governance?'''

Environmental governance refers to the processes of [[decision-making]] involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the 'multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of “good governance”; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]]' (IUCN 2014)

Key principles of environmental governance include:

* Embedding the environment in all levels of decision-making and action
* Conceptualizing cities and communities, economic and political life as a subset of the environment
* Emphasizing the connection of people to the ecosystems in which they live
* Promoting the transition from open-loop/cradle-to-grave systems (like garbage disposal with no recycling) to closed-loop/[[cradle-to-cradle]] systems (like [[permaculture]] and [[zero waste]] strategies).

'''Neoliberal Environmental Governance''' – is an approach to the theory of environmental governance framed by a perspective on [[neoliberalism]] as an ideology, policy and practice in relation to the biophysical world. There are many definitions and applications of neoliberalism, e.g. in economic, international relations, etc. However, the traditional understanding of neoliberalism is often simplified to the notion of the primacy of market-led economics through the rolling back of the state, [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]]. Neoliberalism has evolved particularly over the last 40 years with many scholars leaving their ideological footprint on the neoliberal map. [[Hayek]] and [[Friedman]] believed in the superiority of the free market over state intervention. As long as the market was allowed to act freely, the supply/demand law would ensure the ‘optimal’ price and reward. In [[Karl Polanyi]]’s opposing view this would also create a state of tension in which self-regulating [[free market]]s disrupt and alter social interactions and “displace other valued means of living and working”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to the notion of an unregulated market economy there has also been a “paradoxical increase in [state] intervention”&lt;ref&gt;Jessop B. (2002) ‘Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Urban Governance: A State Theoretical Perspective’, Antipode, 34 (3), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; in the choice of economic, legislative and social policy reforms, which are pursued by the state to preserve the neoliberal order. This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in “purposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations".&lt;ref&gt;Peck, J. and Tickell, A. (2002) ‘Neoliberalising Space’, Antipode, 34(3): p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic ‘thing’ with a clear end point.&lt;ref&gt;Heynen N and Robins P. (2005) ‘The neoliberalisation of nature: Governance, privatization, enclosure and valuation’, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 16(1): p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally “connected neoliberalisation” processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that “cover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or “accumulation by dispossession” that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (2004) ‘Privatizing conditions of production: trade agreements as neoliberal environmental governance’, Geoforum, 35(3), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw, E. (2005) ‘Dispossessing H20: The contested terrain of water privatisation’, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 16(1): pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, B. (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’ Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94(3): pp. 565–584.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[water privatization|privatisation of water supply]] and [[sewage treatment]] in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to “deploy markets as the solution to environmental problems” in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.431&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a [[quantifiable]] resource ([[Robert Costanza|Costanza]], for example, estimates the earth [[ecosystem services|ecosystem's service]] value to be between 16 and [[orders of magnitude (currency)#1 trillion to 100 trillion|54 trillion dollars]] per year&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al., (1997) ‘The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital’, Nature 387(6630): pp. 255&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Environmental issues==

===Main drivers of environmental degradation===

''[[Economic growth]]'' – The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and [[environmental degradation]], arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a [[degrowth]] phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the [[quality of life]].

''[[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]]'' – The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or [[consumerist]] ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person.

''Destruction of [[biodiversity]]'' – The complexity of the planet’s ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is [[deforestation]]. Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]]. Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their [[environmental impact]].

''[[Population growth]]'' – Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women’s status.

"[[Pollution]]" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists.

"Agricultural practices" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and [[overgrazing]] lead to land degradation. The soil gets [[soil erosion|eroded]], and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in [[desertification]] of the land. Apart from [[land degradation]], [[water pollution]] is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can [[surface runoff|run-off]] into rivers and [[water contamination|contaminate the water]].

===Challenges===

The crisis by the impact of human activities on nature calls for governance. Which includes responses by international institutions, governments and citizens, who should meet this crisis by pooling the experience and knowledge of each of the agents and institutions concerned.

The [[environmental protection]] measures taken remain insufficient. The necessary reforms require time, energy, money and diplomatic negotiations. The situation has not generated a unanimous response. Persistent divisions slow progress towards global environmental governance.

The global nature of the crisis limits the effects of national or sectoral measures. Cooperation is necessary between actors and institutions in international trade, sustainable development and [[peace]].

Global, continental, national and local governments have employed a variety of approaches to environmental governance. Substantial positive and negative spillovers limit the ability of any single jurisdiction to resolve issues.

Challenges facing environmental governance include:

* Inadequate continental and global agreements
* Unresolved tensions between maximum development, sustainable development and maximum protection, limiting funding, damaging links with the economy and limiting application of [[Multilateral Environment Agreement]]s (MEAs).
* Environmental funding is not self-sustaining, diverting resources from problem-solving into funding battles.
* Lack of integration of sector policies
* Inadequate institutional capacities
* Ill-defined priorities
* Unclear objectives
* Lack of coordination within the UN, governments, the private sector and civil society
* Lack of shared vision
* Interdependencies among development/sustainable economic growth, trade, agriculture, health, peace and security.
* International imbalance between environmental governance and trade and finance programs, e.g., [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).
* Limited credit for organizations running projects within the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
* Linking [[UNEP]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[World Bank]] with MEAs
* Lack of government capacity to satisfy MEA obligations
* Absence of the gender perspective and equity in environmental governance
* Inability to influence public opinion&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf Global Conventions and Environmental Governance; Inforesources Focus No. 3, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;UNEP; International Environmental Governance and the Reform of the United Nations, XVI Meeting of the Forum of Environment Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean;  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/civil_society/PDF_docs/3rdGCSF_CS_Statement_IEG.pdf Civil Society Statement on International Environmental Governance; Seventh special session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF; Cartagena, Colombia; February 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Time lag between human action and environmental effect, sometimes as long as a generation&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underdal | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity and challenges of long term environmental governance | url = | journal = Global environmental change | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 386–393 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental problems being embedded in very complex systems, of which our understanding is still quite weak&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"/&gt;

All of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of [[multilateralism]] in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems.

On the other hand, The [[local Agenda 21|Agenda 21]] program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities.&lt;ref&gt;7,000 municipalities is very few, in view of the fact that over a million municipalities exist on the planet and that initial forecasts were for local agenda 21 actions being adopted in 500,000 municipalities in 1996 and throughout the rest of the planet in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action.

Bäckstrand and Saward wrote, “sustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.”&lt;ref name=Saward&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p58974_index.html Bäckstrand, Karin; Saward, Michel; Democratizing Global Governance: Stakeholder Democracy at the World Summit for Sustainable Development; Document presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association; Chicago; 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local governance===
A 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities.&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"&gt;Leach, M., Mearns, R and Scoones, I. (1997), Challenges to community based sustainable development, in IDS Bulletin Vol 28:4, pp 1&lt;/ref&gt; Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control”&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"/&gt; and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of innovation]] theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community-centered conservation interventions spread through space and time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Local level governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Pulgar Vidal observed a “new institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.”&lt;ref name=pv&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11304196171GAD-espanol.pdf Pulgar Vidal, Manuel; Gobernanza Ambiental Descentralizada (Decentralized Environmental Governance); 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes:

* formal and informal regulations, procedures and processes, such as consultations and participative democracy;
* social interaction that can arise from participation in development programs or from the reaction to perceived injustice;
* regulating social behaviours to reclassify an individual question as a [[public matter]];
* within-group [[participation (decision making)|participation]] in decision-making and relations with external actors.

He found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are:

* access to [[social capital]], including local knowledge, leaders and local shared vision;
* democratic access to information and decision-making;
* local government activity in environmental governance: as facilitator of access to natural resources, or as policy maker;
* an institutional framework that favours decentralized environmental governance and creates forums for social interaction and making widely accepted agreements acceptable.&lt;ref name=pv/&gt;

The legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population.&lt;ref name=poats&gt;[http://www.portalces.org/content/view/85/100000022/lang,Spanish Suárez, David; Poats, Susan V.; Procesos de Gobernanza Ambiental en el Manejo Participativo de Áreas Protegidas en Carchi (Environmental Governance Processes in the Participative Management of Carchi Protected Areas); Symposium; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo G., Saija G., Salomone R. 2013. From coastal management to environmental management: The sustainable eco-tourism program for the mid-western coast of Sardinia (Italy). Land Use Policy (31), 460-471&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governance===
States play a crucial role in environmental governance, because "however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments".&lt;ref&gt;Cable, V. 1999, ''Globalisation and global governance'', Chatham House Papers, London&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;WHAT 2000, "Governance for a sustainable future", Reports of the Commissions of the World Humanity Action Trust, viewed 22 April 2014, http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/governance/future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, [[environmental management]] has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the ''Grenelle de l’environnement''&lt;ref&gt;Operational Committee No. 24 "Institutions and stakeholder representativity" (introduced by Bertrand Pancher); Final report to the Prime Minister, senior Minister, Minister for the Ecology, Sustainable Development and Territorial Planning; 2008, also known as the Rapport Pancher.&lt;/ref&gt; process:

* included a variety of actors (e.g. the state, political leaders, unions, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and environmental protection foundations);
* allowed stakeholders to interact with the legislative and executive powers in office as indispensable advisors;
* worked to integrate other institutions, particularly the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council|Economic and Social Council]], to form a pressure group that participated in the process for creating an environmental governance model;
* attempted to link with environmental management at regional and local levels.

If environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauxglacees.com/Gouvernance-environnementale-vers Laime, Marc; Gouvernance environnementale: vers une meilleure concertation ? (Environmental Governance: towards better consultation?); 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

“In southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states’ political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/es/sobre/union/secretaria/oficinas/sudamerica/sur_trabajo/sur_pgam.cfm IUCN; Gobernanza ambiental para un desarrollo sostenible (Environmental Governance for Sustainable Development).]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies.

=== Global Governance ===
At the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and "a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt; The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and other international organisations such as UNEP ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]). Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;  This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global environmental governance is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. “It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt; State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains.&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"&gt;Newell, P.(2008). The political economy of global environmental governance. Review of International Studies, 34, pp 508&lt;/ref&gt; Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the “managing of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.”&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"/&gt;

=== Issues of scale ===

==== Multi-tier governance ====

The literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of [[environmental issues]] have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadowcroft|first=James|title=Politics and scale: some implications for environmental governance|journal=Landscape and urban planning|year=2002|volume=61|issue=2–4|pages=169–179|doi=10.1016/s0169-2046(02)00111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: [[internationalisation]], increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafferty|first=William|title=Implementing Sustainable Development|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|author2=Meadowcroft, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales.

==== Institutional fit ====

[[Hans Bruyninckx]] claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruyninckx|first=Hans|title=Environmental evaluation practices and the issue of scale|journal=New directions for evaluation|year=2009|volume=122|pages=31–39|doi=10.1002/ev.293|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/234737/1/newdirectionsevaluation-HB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Oran|title=The globalization of socio-ecological systems: An agenda for scientific research|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=304–316|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the literature addresses the level of [[governance]] rather than ecological scale.

[[Elinor Ostrom]], amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=C|title=The problem of fit between ecosystems and institutions: ten years later|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2007|volume=12|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrem|first=Elinor|title=A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=39|pages=15181–15187|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702288104|bibcode=2007PNAS..10415181O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebel|first=L |author2=Garden, L |author3=Imamura, M|title=The Politics of Scale, Position and Place in the Governance of Water Resources in the Mekong Region|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of  [[river basins]].&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt;

==Environmental governance issues==

===Soil deterioration===

[[soil degradation|Soil]] and [[land degradation|land deterioration]] reduces its [[field capacity|capacity]] for capturing, [[water storage|storing]] and recycling water, energy and food. [[Alliance 21]] proposed solutions in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article514.html Alliance 21’s Proposal Paper “Save our Soils to Sustain our Societies”]&lt;/ref&gt;

* include [[Soil regeneration|soil rehabilitation]] as part of conventional and popular education
* involve all stakeholders, including policymakers and authorities, producers and land users, the scientific community and civil society to manage incentives and enforce regulations and laws
* establish a set of binding rules, such as an international convention
* set up mechanisms and incentives to facilitate transformations
* gather and share knowledge;
* mobilize funds nationally and internationally

===Climate change===
The scientific consensus on [[climate change]] is expressed in the reports of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Oreskes, N 2004, "Beyond the ivory tower", Science, vol. 306, no. 5702, pp, 1686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drivers of climate change can include
- Changes in [[solar irradiance]]
- Changes in atmospheric [[trace gas]] and [[aerosol]] concentrations
Evidence of climate change can be identified by examining
- Atmospheric concentrations of [[Green House Gas]]es (GHGs) such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2)
- Land and sea surface temperatures
- Atmospheric water vapor
- [[Precipitation]]
- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events
- [[Glacier]]s
- Rapid sea [[ice loss]]
- Sea level&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter01_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as [[fuel consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuels, [[deforestation]], increased [[agricultural production]] and production of [[xenobiotic]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, JC &amp; Elder, DL 1992 Climate, Sealevel rise and the coastal zone: management and planning of global changes, Ocean and coastal management, vol 18, pp- 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels. [[Kyoto protocol]] and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gateway/the-negotiations/the-un-climate-change-convention-and-the-kyoto-protocol&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], mainly {{CO2}}. Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon.

Two decades following the [[Brundtland Report]], however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted.

===Biodiversity===

Environmental governance for protecting the [[biodiversity]] has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, [[urban growth]], [[industrialization]] of countries, [[resource use|use of natural resources]], control of [[invasive species]],  the correct use of water and protection of [[air quality]]. Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have.

[[Population growth]] and [[urbanization]] have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes [[habitat loss]], which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and  [[habitat fragmentation]] affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed.&lt;ref&gt;Steffan-Dewenter &amp; Tscharntkae, 2000 ‘Butterfly community structure in fragmented habitats’  Ecology Letters, vol. 3, pp. 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

‘''Species are genetically unique and irreplaceable their loss is irreversible. Ecosystems vary across a vast range of parameters, and similar ecosystems (whether wetlands, forests, coastal reserves etc) cannot be presumed to be interchangeable, such that the loss of one can be compensated by protection or restoration of another''’.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2010 ‘Environmental Governance’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/environmental_law/elp_work/elp_work_issues/elp_work_governance&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid habitat loss, and consequently biodiversity loss, politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2007 ‘Guidelines for applying the precautionary principle to biodiversity conservation and  natural resource management’ viewed 28 May 2014, cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ln250507_ppguidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans.&lt;ref&gt;Sampford, C 2002 ‘Environmental governance for biodiversity’ Environmental Science &amp; Policy, vol. 5, pp. 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt; International agreements are good way to have it done right.

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD’s objectives are: “to conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.” The Convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is “a common concern for all humanity”. The       Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies.

The Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets, were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of ‘''halting and eventually reversing the loss of biodiversity of the planet''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"&gt;Convention on Biodiversity 2010 ‘Strategic Goals &amp; Targets for 2020’ viewed 28  May 2014, www.cbd.int/2011-2020/goals/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to ‘''promote its overall vision of living in harmony with nature''’ As result (...) ‘''mainstream biodiversity at different levels. Throughout the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity, governments are encouraged to develop, implement and communicate the results of national strategies for implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; According to the CBD &lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; the five Aichi targets are:
#‘''Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society'';
#''Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use'';
#''Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and [[genetic diversity]]'';
#''Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]]'';
#''Enhance implementation through [[participatory planning]], [[knowledge management]] and [[capacity building]]''.’

=== Water ===

The 2003 [[UN World Water Development Report]] claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%.{{update|date=September 2013}}
In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2003). ''World Water Development Report 1: "Water for People, Water for Life"''. Retrieved from: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129726e.pdf#page=27&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the UK’s [[WaterAid]] charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases.

According to Alliance 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article501.html Proposals Related to the Water Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; “All levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of [[irrigation]] and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.”

[[Australia]]n [[water resources]] have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in [[groundwater]] use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia’s inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of water trading systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated.  More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in [[Macquarie Marshes]] has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing [[daughterless carp]] to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands.  Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control.  The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===

On 16 September 1987 the United Nations General Assembly signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] to address the declining [[ozone layer]]. Since that time, the use of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (industrial refrigerants and aerosols) and farming fungicides such as [[methyl bromide]] has mostly been eliminated, although other damaging gases are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gareau, Brian J. From Precaution to Profit: Contemporary Challenges to Global Environmental Protection in the Montreal Protocol (2013, Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear risk===

The [[Nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] is the primary multilateral agreement governing nuclear activity.

===Transgenic organisms===
[[Genetically modified organisms]] are not the subject of any major multilateral agreements. They are the subject of various restrictions at other levels of governance. GMOs are in widespread use in the US, but are heavily restricted in many other jurisdictions.

Controversies have ensued over [[golden rice]], [[AquAdvantage salmon|genetically modified salmon]], [[Monsanto#Seeds|genetically modified seeds]], disclosure and other topics.

=== Precautionary principle ===

The [[precautionary principle]] or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.
The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, BD 2000, 'Applying the precautionary principle to the environment', Bulletin Of The World Health Organization, 78, 9, p. 1159, Health Business Elite, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;European Report 25 Jan. 2013"ENVIRONMENT : PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE: EEA REPORT DAMNING TO INDUSTRY."Academic OneFile. Web. 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-environmental conflicts ===
Leading experts have emphasized on the importance of taking into account the security aspects the environment and natural resources will cause. The twenty-first century is looking into a future with an increase in mass migrations of refugees, wars and praetorian regimes caused by the effect of environmental degradation such as water scarcity, deforestation and soil erosion, air pollution and, climate change effects such as rising sea levels. For a long time, foreign-policy challenges have focused on social causes as being the only reason for social and political changes. However, it is a crucial moment to understand and take into consideration the security implications that environmental stress will bring to the current political and social structure around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|date=February 1994|title=The Coming Anarchy: How scarcity, crime, overpopulation,tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet.|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=GLOBAL|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==

===Conventions===

The main multilateral conventions, also known as Rio Conventions, are as follows:

[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1992–1993): aims to conserve biodiversity. Related agreements include the [http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cartagena-protocol-en.pdf Cartagena Protocol] on biosafety.

[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCC) (1992–1994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|stabilize the climate system]] without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) (1994–1996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa).

Further conventions:
* [http://www.ramsar.org Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance] (1971–1975)
* [http://whc.unesco.org UNESCO World Heritage Convention]  (1972–1975)
* [http://www.cites.org Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES)] (1973–1975)
* [http://www.cms.int Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species] (1979–1983)
* [http://www.unece.org/env/water Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention)] (1992–1996)
* [http://www.basel.int Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal] (1989–1992)
* [http://www.pic.int Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade]
* [http://www.pops.int Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (COP)] (2001–2004)

The Rio Conventions are characterized by:

* obligatory execution by signatory states
* involvement in a sector of global environmental governance
* focus on the fighting poverty and the development of sustainable living conditions;
* funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for countries with few financial resources;
* inclusion of a for assessing ecosystem status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumassessment.org/fr/index.aspx Millennium assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental conventions are regularly criticized for their:

* rigidity and verticality: they are too descriptive, homogenous and top down, not reflecting the diversity and complexity of environmental issues. Signatory countries struggle to translate objectives into concrete form and incorporate them consistently;
* duplicate structures and aid: the sector-specific format of the conventions produced duplicate structures and procedures. Inadequate cooperation between government ministries;
* contradictions and incompatibility: e.g., “if reforestation projects to reduce {{CO2}} give preference to monocultures of exotic species, this can have a negative impact on biodiversity (whereas natural regeneration can strengthen both biodiversity and the conditions needed for life).”&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"/&gt;

Until now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the [[Commission for Sustainable Development]], but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}

===Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)===

MEAs are agreements between several countries that apply internationally or regionally and concern a variety of environmental questions. As of 2013 over 500 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), including 45 of global scope involve at least 72 signatory countries.&lt;ref name=inomata&gt;Inomata, Tadanori; Management Review of Environmental Governance within the United Nations System; United Nations; Joint Inspection Unit; Geneva; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Multilateral Environmental Agreement Negotiator’s Handbook: Pacific Region 2013|date=2013|publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme / New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law, University of Auckland|location=Samoa / New Zealand|isbn=978-982-04-0475-5|url=http://www.sprep.org/attachments/Publications/EMG/MEA_Handbook_2013.pdf|author2=Stroud, Lucy |author3=Peteru, Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as [[deforestation in Borneo]] or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states.

Many Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"&gt;Steiner, A &amp; Oviir, M (2010) ‘Auditing the Implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs): A Primer for Auditors’, United Nations Environment Programme, pp. 1-136&lt;/ref&gt; Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt; These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Union, (2010) ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’, African Union, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://www.au.int/en/content/bamako-convention-ban-import-africa-and-control-transboundary-movement-and-management-hazard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil Action Network (2011) ‘The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal’, Basil Action Network, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://ban.org/about_basel_conv/treaty_text.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

“The environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#International_institutions UNEP], MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level.

"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases:

* a) assessment of environment status;
* b) international policy development;
* c) formulation of MEAs;
* d) policy implementation;
* e) policy assessment;
* f) enforcement;
* g) sustainable development.

"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three
phases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.”&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

Lack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them.&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

==Background==

The risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the [[Stockholm Conference]] (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the [[Law of treaties|Law of Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Mento, Josep; The Global Environment and International law, University of Texas Press; 2003; p 7..&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs.

The [[Brundtland Report]], published in 1987 by the [[Earth Summit|UN Commission on Environment and Development]], stipulated the need for economic development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs.

===Rio Conference (1992) and reactions===

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], was the first major international meeting since the end of the [[Cold War]] and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of [[secretariats]].

Governments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.&lt;ref name=boug&gt;Bouguerra, Larbi; La consommation assassine.

Ideas for responsible consumption) ; Éditions Charles Léopold Mayer; 2005; adaptation of State of the World. Special Focus - The Consumer Society; The Worldwatch Institute; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agenda 21===

[[Agenda 21]] is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory-based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies.

The Agenda has been accused of using [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled “International Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies” states, “The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.”

===International institutions===

====United Nations Environment Program====
{{main|United Nations Environment Program}}
The UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries.

In 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

According to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP:

* initiate a strategic independent overhaul of its mission;
* consolidate the financial information and transparency process;
* restructure organizing governance by creating an operative executive council that balances the omnipresence of the overly imposing and fairly ineffectual Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF).

Other proposals offer a new mandate to “produce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and [http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Des-responsabilites-communes-mais.html common but differentiated responsibilities] should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.”&lt;ref&gt;Reforming International Environmental Governance: Statement representing views expressed at two meetings of stakeholders held at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP:

* obtain a social consensus on a long-term vision;
* analyze the current situation and future scenarios;
* produce a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of sustainable development;
* build on existing strategies and processes;
* multiply links between national and local strategies;
* include all these points in the financial and budget plan;
* adopt fast controls to improve process piloting and identification of progress made;
* implement effective participation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/Statement%20on%20IEG%20by%20civil%20society.pdf Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, et al (comp.); Options for Strengthening the Environment Pillar of Sustainable Development. Compilation of Civil Society Proposals on the Institutional Framework for the United Nations' Environmental Activities; 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group stated, “Consider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/ieg/SubmissionsToThePanel/BRAZILIANFORUMOFNGOS.pdf Submission by the Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and the Development to the Panel Consultation with Civil Society; June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Environment Facility (GEF)====
{{main|Global Environment Facility}}
Created in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.

GEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million.&lt;ref name=young2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoë |first=Young |title=A new green order: The World Bank and the politics of the global environmental facility |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Andler, Lydia; The Secretariat of the Global Environment Facility: From Network to Bureaucracy; "Global Governance Working Paper", no. 24; Amsterdam et al.; The Global Governance Project; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others.&lt;ref&gt;Werksman, Jake; Consolidating global environmental governance: New lessons from the GEF?; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global "green market". It represents “an adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.”{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}  Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment.

GEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Conventions conventions]. It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002.{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}

====United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)====
{{main|Commission on Sustainable Development}}
This intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006-2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wri.org/pubs/pubs_pdf.cfm?PubID=3764 World Resources Institute; World Resources 2002–2004: Decisions for the Earth: Balance, Voice and Power; Washington DC; 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.&lt;ref name=Najam&gt;[http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/geg.pdf Najam, A., Papa, M. and Taiyab, N. Global Environmental Governance. A Reform Agenda; IISD; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Environment Organization (WEO)====
{{main|United Nations Environment Organization}}
A proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the [[World Health Organization]] could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Proposals proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/Gouvernance-internationale-de-l'environnement-les-prochaines-etapes Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B.; Gouvernance internationale de l'environnement: les prochaines étapes (International Environmental Governance; the next stages)]; in "Synthèse", 2005, no. 01, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI).&lt;/ref&gt; WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====World Bank====
{{main|World Bank}}
The World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank’s mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Marschinski, Robert; Behrle, Steffen; The World Bank: Making the Business Case for the Environment; "Global Governance Working Paper No 21"; Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP’s standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance. Other financial institutions, regional development banks and the private sector also drew up their own standards. Criticism is not directed at the World Bank’s standards in themselves, which Najam considered as “robust”,&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; but at their legitimacy and efficacy.

===== GEF =====

The [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]'s account of itself as of 2012 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef] is as "the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment", period, which "provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants."  It claims to have provided "$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million."  It serves as mechanism for the:
*[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD)
*[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)
*[[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs)
*[[Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD)
*implementation of [[Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in some countries with "economies in transition" [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef]
This mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/instrument].

====World Trade Organization (WTO)====
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO’s mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO’s own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO’s trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country’s ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO’s trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences.

Some criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad.  In a recently dispute over labelling of [[dolphin safe label]]s for [[tuna]] between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed,

====International Monetary Fund (IMF)====
{{main|International Monetary Fund}}
The IMF’s mission is "''to ensure the stability of the international monetary system''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm/|title=IMF -- About|website=www.imf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues."&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

==== UN ICLEI ====

{{main|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives}}

The UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-making&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclei.org/ ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; is named the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Its slogan is "Local Governments for Sustainability".
This body sponsored the concept of [[full cost accounting]] that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance.

ICLEIs projects and achievements include:
*Convincing thousands of municipal leaders to sign the [[World Mayors and Municipal Leaders Declaration on Climate Change]] (2005) which notably requests of other levels of government that:
:Global trade regimes, credits and banking reserve rules be reformed to advance debt relief and incentives to implement policies and practices that reduce and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ICLEI promotes [[best practice exchange]] among municipal governments globally, especially [[green infrastructure]], [[sustainable procurement]].

====Other secretariats====
Other international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including:

* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), promoting development;
* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) which works on the climate and atmosphere;
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  (FAO) working on the protection of agriculture, forests and fishing;
* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) which focuses on nuclear security.

Over 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam.&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them.

====Criticism====

According to Bauer, Busch and Siebenhüner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glogov.org Bauer, Steffen; Busch, Per-Olof; Siebenhüner, Bernd; Administering International Governance: What Role for Treaty Secretariats? "Global Governance Working Paper" No 29. Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered.

The United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements.

===States===

====Environmental governance at the state level====

Environmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions.
See also the [[Environmental policy of the European Union]].

====State participation in global environmental governance====

US refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan.

The World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries.

===Business===

Environmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains:

*  values (vision, mission, principles);
*  policy (strategy, objectives, targets);
*  oversight (responsibility, direction, training, communication);
*  process (management systems, initiatives, internal control, monitoring and review, stakeholder dialogue, transparency, environmental accounting, reporting and verification);
*  performance (performance indicators, benchmarking, eco-efficiency, reputation, compliance, liabilities, business development).&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0904BKFE-e-e.pdf White, Andrew; Klernan, Matthew; Corporate Environment Governance. A Study into the Influence of Environmental Governance and the Financial Performance; Environment Agency (United Kingdom Government); 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

White and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Business environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Environmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/governance.html |title=Environmental Governance |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance is the set of [[Business process|processes]], customs, [[policies]], laws, and institutions affecting the way a [[corporation]] (or [[company]]) is managed. Corporate [[governance]] is affected by the relationships among [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. These stakeholders research and quantify performance to compare and contrast the environmental performance of thousands of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/stakeholders.html |title=Priority Stakeholders |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large corporations with global supply chains evaluate the environmental performance of business partners and suppliers for marketing and ethical reasons. Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies.

===Non-governmental organizations===
{{Main|Non-governmental organizations}}
According to Bäckstrand and Saward,&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; “broader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.”

Local activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company’s plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bebbington, Anthony; et al.; Los movimientos sociales frente a la minería: disputando el desarrollo territorial andino (Social Movements and Mining: disputes over territorial development in the Andes); in J. Bengoa (ed.) "Movimientos sociales y desarrollo territorial rural en América Latina" (Social Movements and Territorial Rural Development in Latin America). Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher, Dana R.; Civil Society Protest and Participation: Civic Engagement Within the Multilateral Governance Regime pp. 176-201; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/hawaii/howwework/community-based-marine-conservation.xml |title=Community-Based Marine Conservation &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flacso.org.ec/docs/WP_005_AndradeM_01_2.pdf Andrade Mendoza, Karen; La gobernanza ambiental en el Ecuador: El conflicto alrededor de la licencia Ambiental en el bloque 31, en el parque nacional Yasuní (Environmental Governance in Ecuador:  the conflict concerning the environmental license for block 31 in the Yasuní National Park); FLACSO; Observatorio Socioambiental; Quito; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bengoa,&lt;ref&gt;Bengoa, José; et al. Movimientos sociales, gobernanza ambiental y desarrollo territorial (Social Movements, Environmental Governance and Territorial Development) ; Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; “social movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.” But despite successes in this area, “these institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.” He cites several reasons:

* conflict between in-group cohesion and openness to outside influence;
* limited trust between individuals;
* contradiction between social participation and innovation;
* criticisms without credible alternatives to environmentally damaging activities

A successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest.&lt;ref name=poats/&gt;

==Proposals==

The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are:&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt;

* expert leadership;
* positioning science as the authoritative basis of sound environmental policy;
* coherence and reasonable coordination;
* well-managed institutions;
* incorporate environmental concerns and actions within other areas of international policy and action

=== Coherence and coordination ===

Despite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth’s ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"&gt;{{cite web

| access-date=30 March 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Rorden | title = Global governance : critical perspectives | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780203302804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inforesources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf ''Global Conventions and Environmental Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are:

* parallel structures and competition, without a coherent strategy
* contradictions and incompatibilities, without appropriate compromise
* competition between multiple agreements with incompatible objectives, regulations and processes
* integrating policy from macro- to micro- scales.

Recommended measures:

* MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ UN Millenium Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; and conventions, combining sustainability and reduction of poverty and equity;
* country-level approach linking global and local scales
* coordination and division of tasks in a multilateral approach that supports developing countries and improves coordination between donor countries and institutions
* use of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.aspx Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; in development planning
* transform conflicts into tradeoffs, synergies and win-win options

Contemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"/&gt;

Some analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently.

=== Democratization ===

Starting in 2002, Saward&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; and others began to view the [[Earth Summit]] process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by:

* the importance given to scientific and technical considerations
* the official and unofficial participation of many actors with heterogeneous activity scopes
* growing uncertainty
* a new interpretation of [[international law]] and social organization models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behnassi | first1 = Mohamed |title= Les négociations environnementales multilatérales: Vers une gouvernance environnementale mondiale (Multilateral Environmental Negotiations: towards world environmental governance) |journal= C Durable: Doctoral thesis summary paper|date= 2003|url=http://cdurable.info/Les-Negociations-Environnementales-Multinationales-NEM-vers-une-Gouvernance-Environnementale-Mondiale-GEM,1136.html|location=Casablanca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johal | first1 = Surjinder | last2 = Ulph | first2 = Alistair | title = Globalization, lobbying, and international environmental governance | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–403 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | date = August 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments.

===Institutional reform===

Actors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN/UNPAN021755.pdf Resolution 60/1 of the United Nations General Assembly.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes “the need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.”

Proposals include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/resolution230708.pdf UN environmental governance report]&lt;/ref&gt;

* greater and better coordination between agencies;
* strengthen and acknowledge UNEP’s scientific role;
* identify MEA areas to strengthen coordination, cooperation and teamwork between different agreements;
* increase regional presence;
* implement the [[Bali Strategic Plan]] on improving technology training and support for the application of environmental measures in poor countries;
* demand that UNEP and MEAs participate formally in all relevant WTO committees as observers.
* strengthen its financial situation;
* improve secretariats’ efficiency and effectiveness.

One of the main studies addressing this issue proposes:

* clearly divide tasks between development organizations, UNEP and the MEAs
* adopt a political direction{{clarify|date=September 2013}} for environmental protection and sustainable development
* authorize the UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum to adopt the UNEP medium-term strategy
* allow Member States to formulate and administer MEAs an independent secretariat for each convention
* support UNEP in periodically assessing MEAs and ensure coordination and coherence
* establish directives for setting up national/regional platforms capable of incorporating MEAs in the Common Country Assessment (CCA) process and [[United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)]]&lt;ref&gt;The CCA is the main diagnostic tool available for teams working in UN countries and their partners. It is used to assess and create a shared understanding of the underlying challenges facing a country during its development. The UNDAF is a product of the CCA analysis and collaboration process and provides the basis for UN cooperation programmes. (Source: ISDR; Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo Framework; United Nations; 2007; chapter 4; p. 81-120).&lt;/ref&gt;
* establish a global joint planning framework
* study the aptitude and efficiency of environmental activities’ funding, focusing on differential costs

===Education===

A 2001 Alliance 21 report proposes six fields of action:&lt;ref&gt;Ziaka, Yolanda; Robicon, Philippe; Souchon, Christian; Environmental Education: Six Proposals for Citizens’ Action. Proposal Paper, [http://www.alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World]; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthen citizens' critical faculties to ensure greater democratic control of political orientations
* develop a global and critical approach
* develop civic education training for teachers
* develop training for certain socio-professional groups
* develop environmental education for the entire population;
* assess the resulting experiences of civil society

===Transform daily life===

Individuals can modify consumption, based on [[voluntary simplicity]]: changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population’s basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend.

Alternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems.

Alternative energy sources are becoming less costly.

Ecological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another.

Governments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

The [[Community Environmental governance Global Alliance]] encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge.

[[Smart Growth]] is an international movement that employs key tenets of Environmental governance in [[urban planning]].

===Policies and regulations===

Establish policies and regulations that promote “infrastructures for well being” whilst addressing the political, physical and cultural levels.

Eliminate subsidies that have a negative environmental impact and tax pollution

Promoting workers’ personal and family development.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

===Coordination===

A programme of national workshops on synergies between the three Rio Conventions launched in late 2000, in collaboration with the relevant secretariats. The goal was to strengthen coordination at the local level by:

* sharing information
* promoting political dialogue to obtain financial support and implement programmes
* enabling the secretariats to update their joint work programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommetjohannesburg.org/initiatives/gouvernance-environnementale.html Diallo, Hama Arba; La gouvernance environnementale et la synergie entre les trois conventions globales (Environmental Governance and the Synergy between the Three Global Conventions); Johannesburg Summit document; 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Laura B.; The Effectiveness of WTO and WIPO: Lessons for Environmental Governance? in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; “In the context of globalization, the question of linking up environmental themes with other subjects, such as trade, investment and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the economic incentives to participate in and apply agreements would seem to provide an important lesson for the effective development of environmental governance structures.” Environmental concerns would become part of the global economic system. “These problems also contain the seeds of a new generation of international conflicts that could affect both the stability of international relations and collective security. Which is why the concept of ‘collective security’ has arisen.”

Moving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system. Kanie&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichika; Global Environmental Governance in Terms of Vertical Linkages;  pp. 86-113 {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that NGOs, scientists, international institutions and stakeholder partnerships can reduce the distance that separates the local and international levels.

'''Erotic lactation''' is [[sexual arousal]] by [[breastfeeding]] on a woman's breast.  Depending on the context, the practice can also be referred to as adult suckling, adult nursing, and adult breastfeeding.  Practitioners sometimes refer to themselves as being in an '''adult nursing relationship''' ('''ANR''').&lt;ref name="forth133-136"&gt;(Forth ''et al.'' 2006, pp. 133–136)&lt;/ref&gt; Two persons in an exclusive relationship can be called a nursing couple.

"Milk fetishism" and "lactophilia" are medical, diagnostic terms for [[paraphilia|paraphilias]] and are used for disorders according to the precise criteria of [[ICD|ICD-10]] and [[DSM-IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Schöbl, Roland (2007). ''Erotische Laktation'', Denkholz Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
Breasts, and especially nipples, are highly [[erogenous zone]]s, for both men and women. Nipple and breast stimulation of women are a near-universal aspect of [[human sexuality]], though nipples in males are not as sexualized.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Humans are the only primates whose female members have permanently enlarged breasts after the onset of puberty; the breasts of other primate species are enlarged only during pregnancy and nursing. One hypothesis postulates that the breasts grew as a frontal counterpart to the buttocks as primates became upright to attracting mates, a model first developed in 1967.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; Other hypotheses include that by chance breasts act as a cushion for infant heads, are a signal of fertility, or elevate the infant's head in breastfeeding to prevent suffocation.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Paradoxically, there is even a school that believes that they are an [[evolutionary flaw]], and can actually suffocate a nursing infant.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
The association of pleasure and nutrition holds true as well for the lips, also erogenous zones, where pleasure may have led to "[[kiss feeding]]", in which mothers chew food before passing it on to the child.{{efn|name=kiss feeding}}

Unintended milk flow ([[galactorrhea]]) is often caused by nipple stimulation and it is possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast.  Nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J. (May 2006), "The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality". ''Sexual &amp; Relationship Therapy''. '''21''' (2):237–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women lose the ability to be aroused while breastfeeding, and thus would not find lactation with a sexual partner to be erotic.  This can be a result of physical reasons (soreness) or psychological reasons (conflicted about her breasts being used other than for an infant).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mindy A. (2000), ''20 Common Problems in Women's Health Care''. McGraw-Hill Professional, {{ISBN|0-07-069767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
Because female breasts and nipples are generally regarded as an important part of sexual activity in most cultures, &lt;!-- ethnic ones, for instance; like ''Islamic law'' suggests. --&gt; it is not uncommon that couples may proceed from oral stimulation of the nipples to actual breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=BP133&gt;(Forth et al, p 133)&lt;/ref&gt; In lesbian partnerships, mutual breastfeeding has been regarded as a familiar expression of affection and tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sexual Research, Vienna 1928–1932: Universallexikon der Sittengeschichte und Sexualwissenschaft (''Universal encyclopedia of moral history and sexual science''). Digital available as CD ROM "Bilderlexikon der Erotik", Digitale Bibliothek, Berlin/Germany 2004, volume 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its issue of March 13, 2005, the London weekly ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' gave a report of a scientific survey (composed of 1690 British men) revealing that in 25 to 33% of all couples, the male partner had [[Nipple sucking|suckled]] his wife's breasts. Regularly, the men gave a genuine emotional need as their motive.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Rogers, Lois (March 13, 2005), [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article426518.ece "Earth dads give breast milk a try"]. ''The Sunday Times''. Retrieved on 2008-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social implications ==
The breasts have two main roles in human society: nutritive and sexual.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Breastfeeding in general is considered by some to be mildly exhibitionary, especially in Western societies (see [[breastfeeding in public]]).  Breastfeeding mothers have faced legal ramifications for nursing their children into toddlerhood or in public, or for photographing themselves while nursing.&lt;ref name=giles&gt;Giles, Fiona (November 2004), "'Relational, and Strange': a Preliminary Foray into a Project to Queer Breastfeeding." ''Australian Feminist Studies''. '''19''' (45):301–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Nikki Sullivan, in her book ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', calls erotic lactation a manifestation of "Queer."  She defines Queer as an ideology; that is, as a "sort of vague and indefinable set of practices and (political) positions that has the potential to challenge normative knowledges and identities." Drawing on a statement of David Halperin, she continues "since queer is a positionality rather than an identity in the humanist sense, it is not restricted to gays and lesbians but can be taken up by anyone who feels marginalised as a result of their sexual practices."  The heteronormative profile of breastfeeding assumes certain norms:
*an infant between zero and twelve months old;
*motivations of nutritional and developmental benefits for the child and physiological benefits for the mother;
*possible secondary motivations of convenience and cheapness;
*practice in private, domestic settings; and
*breast milk-consumption exclusivity to the youngest infant
Additionally, any relevant third party is assumed to be the mother's [[significant other]] and this person is regulated to a supportive role to maximise the breastfeeding mother's success.&lt;ref name="giles" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
The following are various methods people employ to practice erotic lactation. They are listed according to prevalence, in decreasing order:
; Lactation games: Any kind of sexual activity which includes the woman's milk. Such activity is widespread, and often unintentional, in the time after a woman gives birth, since many women experience a [[let-down reflex]] (releasing milk) when sexually aroused.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
; Lactation pornography: While lactation does appear in [[pornography]], it is a specialty niche and is considered taboo by many because of its proximity to incest and children.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;  Most breast representations are without milk, and abound in the media in an erotic way both in and out of pornography.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
; &lt;span id="anr"&gt;Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR)&lt;/span&gt;: The suckling of milk from a female's breast on a regular basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise it is very difficult to maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buttenstedt, Carl: The "Marriage of happiness": the revelation of woman: A study in nature&lt;/ref&gt; The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.
:ANRs have also been employed in cases where a mother may desire to breastfeed her child, but has to find an alternative to inducing lactation.&lt;ref&gt;(Harrison 1983, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt;  She may have difficulty beginning lactation, so she supplements the infant's suckling with that of a partner.  Or there are cases where breastfeeding was interrupted for an extended period of time as a result of infant prematurity, infant absence, or mother's illness (taking prescription medication).&lt;ref&gt;(Budin 1907, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, adult nursing has often caused lactation to continue until it was possible for the child to resume breastfeeding. Others may want to nurse an adopted child, so use an ANR to stimulate breast milk production before the adoption occurs.  Though such scenarios do not have erotic motivations, erotic expression may be an additional aspect of the relationship.
; Pumping: Some women experience sensual pleasure from [[breast pump|pumping milk from their breasts]] or expressing milk manually—with or without a partner. In addition to the sensual pleasure, women have reported feeling more [[gender role|feminine]] while producing milk and continue with lactation for emotional or sensual reasons after weaning a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Giles: Fresh Milk – The Secret Life of Breasts, NY: Simon and Schuster; Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
; Lactation prostitution: This is the act of breastfeeding '''adults''' for pay (not to be confused with breastfeeding infants or babies for pay, i.e.: wet nursing).  In 2003, there was a report of New Zealand brothel that offered lactation services to its clients.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  Though not strictly prostitution, a Beijing restaurant offered breast-milk-based dishes on its menu.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;
; [[Paraphilic infantilism|Infantilism]]: The non-lactating partner assumes the role of a baby in sexual role-play.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding might play a secondary role in this type of relationship; and being pampered by "mommy", wearing diapers, or a hidden incestuous character may be the predominant motivation in this kind of relationship.
; [[BDSM]]:
:# '''Breastfeeding as a reward (or surrogate pleasure)''': Breastfeeding of the [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] partner can serve as a reward for his/her submission.
:# '''Milking''': Milking of the submissive woman, or commanding her to give milk for her dominant partner.
:# '''Force-feeding''': Commanding the submissive partner to '''receive''' milk '''from''' his/her dominant partner.

== Lactation, re-lactation and induced lactation ==
Erotic lactation between partners or an adult nursing relationship may develop from natural breastfeeding of a baby. During the lactation period the partner starts to suckle on the female breast, and continues after the baby is weaned off. Milk production is continually stimulated and the milk flow continues.  According to the book ''Body parts: critical explorations in corporeality'', adult nursing may occur when an "individual, usually a mother, may choose to continue lactating after weaning a child, so that she avoids the significant physical challenge that inducing lactation can entail."&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;

However, milk production can be "artificially" and intentionally induced in the absence of any pregnancy in the woman. This is called [[induced lactation]], while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to [[relactation|relactate]]. This can be done by regularly sucking on the nipples (several times a day), massaging and squeezing the female breasts, or with additional help from temporary use of milk-inducing drugs, such as the [[dopamine]] [[antagonist]] [[Domperidone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is not necessary that the woman has ever been pregnant, and she can be well in her post-menopausal period.  Once established, lactation adjusts to demand.  As long as there is regular breast stimulation, lactation is possible.&lt;ref name=BP133/&gt;

== Adult lactation historically and culturally ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Suck.JPG|thumb|200px|A woman suckles milk from another woman's breast]] --&gt;
Though birth is the beginning of the separation between mother and child, breastfeeding slows this process, making the mother and infant connect physically continually, sometimes for years.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  As a source of nourishment, the immediacy of this connection is intensified.  Breastfeeding has a sexual element as a result of physiological factors.  In a study conducted in 1999, approximately 33 to 50 percent of mothers found breast feeding erotic, and among them 25 percent felt guilty because of this.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  This study corroborated a study in 1949 that found that in a few cases where the arousal was strong enough to induce orgasm, some nursing mothers abandoned breastfeeding altogether.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; In a 1988 questionnaire on orgasm and pregnancy published in a Dutch magazine for women, when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, a sensation of sexual excitement?", 34 percent (or 153 total) answered in the affirmative.  An additional 71 percent answered in the affirmative when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, pleasurable contractions in the uterine region"&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;

== Adult lactation in history ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Since the European [[Middle Ages]], a multitude of subliminally erotic, visionary experiences of saints have been passed on in which breastfeeding plays a major role. One prominent example is the Lactatio of Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Oskar &lt;1853-1921&gt;: Die Wallfahrt nach Andechs. – 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Charity ===
[[File:Cimon and Pero - Hans Sebald Beham.jpg|thumb|"Cimon and Pero" by Hans Sebald Beham]]
[[File:Roman Charity - Pieter Pauwel Reubens.jpg|thumb|"[[Roman Charity]]" by Peter Paul Rubens 1612]]

[[Roman Charity]] (or ''Caritas Romana'').&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus: Facta et dicta memorabilia, chapter: 5,4 De pietate in parentes.; ''English translation: Valerius Maximus, Memorable Doings and Sayings, ed. by D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Harvard University Press, 2000), vol. 1, book v, no. 4, pp. 501–503''&lt;/ref&gt; is a story of a woman, Pero, who secretly breastfeeds her father, Cimon, after he is incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation. She is found out by a jailer, but her act of selflessness impresses officials and wins her father's release. The story comes from the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] in the years AD 14–AD 37. In about AD 1362 the story was retold by the famous writer [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Boccaccio: De claris mulieribus, chapter: LXV. De romana iuvencula;'' English translation: Giovanni Boccaccio, Famous Women. Edited and translated by Virginia Brown. The I Tatti Renaissance Library. Cambridge, MA, and London, England: Harvard University Press, 2001''&lt;/ref&gt;  After Boccaccio, hundreds or possibly thousands of paintings were created, which tell the story.  A variant of this story can be found at the conclusion of [[John Steinbeck]]'s 1939 novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Primarily, the story tells of a conflict. An existing taboo (implied incest and adult breastfeeding of a woman's milk) ''or'' saving a life by breaking the taboo. In this aspect there is no erotic focus to the story.

Valerius Maximus tells another story about a woman breastfeeding her mother, which is followed by the very short story of a woman breastfeeding her father. The second, father-daughter story in fact consists of one sentence only. Thirteen hundred years later, Boccaccio retells the (first) mother-daughter story, and does not mention the father-daughter story, and the first is apparently forgotten, leading to nearly all "caritas romana" oil paintings and drawings showing only the father-daughter story.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Pre-industrial England ===
Adult suckling was used to treat ailing adults and treat illnesses including eye disease and pulmonary tuberculosis{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}. The writer Thomas Moffat recorded one physician's use of a wet nurse in a tome first published in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;(Prior 1991, p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Boswell-Penc 2006, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
In traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]], someone who suckles the breast of a woman, who is less than 2 years old&lt;ref name="sistani.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |accessdate=July 18, 2010|title=Islamic Laws : Marriage » Conditions of pronouncing Nikah |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119121652/http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |archive-date= 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides many strict rules like that the suckling should be of such quantity that it could be said that the bones of the child were strengthened and the flesh allowed to grow. And if that cannot be ascertained, then if a child suckles for one full day and night, or if it suckles fifteen times to its fill, it will be sufficient&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt;), is that woman's child through a foster relationship (the woman is then called "milk mother"). However, according to the Jurist [[Abu's-Su`ud]] (c.1490–1574), this only applies to sucklings under the age of two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;(Imber 1997, p. 195)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a highly praised scholar for the Shia Muslims: "The child should not have completed two years of his age".&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt; The same latter source states at least 8 conditions that should apply before that child is considered a son/daughter of the feeding woman. A modern Saudi Jurist, in 1983, upheld that if a man suckles from his wife, their marriage is nullified.&lt;ref&gt;(Abdella Doumato 2000, p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;  The query remains a popular one into the 21st century, and has come up in Saudi advice columns.&lt;ref&gt;(Elhadj 2006, p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sunni]] cleric Sheik [[Ezzat Atiya]] (عزت عطية), President of the Hadith Department of Egypt's [[al-Azhar University]] issued a [[fatwa]] in 2007 encouraging women to breastfeed their male business colleagues so that the man could become symbolically related to the woman, thereby precluding any sexual relations and the need for both sexes to [[Sex segregation in Islam|observe modesty]]. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting" It was later denounced and declared defamatory to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6681511.stm|title=Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir|work=BBC News|date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 2013 a domestic staff agency in China named Xinxinyu was reported to be providing wet nurses for the sick and other adults as well as for newborns. The agency's clients could choose to drink the breast milk directly from the breast or to drink it via a breast pump. The reports caused controversy in China, with one writer describing it as "adding to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich." The agency was forced to suspend its operations by Chinese authorities for a number of reasons, one of which was for missing three years of annual checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/04/adult-breast-feeding-report-incenses-china-web-users/#ixzz2YGcidHEK | work=Fox News | title=Adult breast feeding report incenses China web users | date=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In 1903, German philosopher Carl Buttenstedt published his marriage guidebook "''Die Glücksehe – Die Offenbarung im Weibe, eine Naturstudie''" (''The Marriage of Happiness – The Revelation in the Woman, a study from nature''), in which he described and recommended the [[lactational amenorrhea]] method (LAM) as a form of [[contraception]] and natural family planning that also deepens the relationship between wife and husband. He explicitly described erotic lactation as a source of great sexual pleasure for both partners, claiming that this is intended by nature especially on the part of the woman. This particular aspect of his broader general marriage philosophy gained a lot of attention and sparked wide debate. While some welcomed Buttenstedt's advice as inspirational for new ways to improve sexual satisfaction between marriage partners, others warned that this technique could "pathologically increase sexual sensation of both partners."&lt;ref&gt;E.

The ''Bonyu Bar'' (Mother’s Milk Bar), located in [[Tokyo]]’s entertainment and red-light district of [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukicho]], employs nursing women who provide customers with breast milk in a glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros). In the latter case the women can run their fingers through the customers' hair, coo and say their name as they suckle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=fr|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Japon : vous prendrez bien un verre de lait… maternel|trans-title=Japan: Enjoy a glass of… Mother's Milk |url=http://www.atlantico.fr/atlantico-light/japon-prendrez-bien-verre-lait-maternel-1974264.html |newspaper=Atlantico |location=France |date=26 January 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Cheers To This Beverage Shot Made With Human Breast Milk |url=http://www.dailyoffbeat.com/articles/5960/20150120/breast-milk-shot-lactation-bar-breast-milk-adults.htm |newspaper=Daily Offbeat |location= |date=20 January 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080118/http://www.dailyoffbeat.com/articles/5960/20150120/breast-milk-shot-lactation-bar-breast-milk-adults.htm |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euxinia''' or '''euxinic conditions''' occur when water is both [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] and sulfidic. This means that there is no [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a raised level of free [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water.  The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (''Euxeinos Pontos)''- which translates to "hospitable sea".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Katja M.|last2=Kump|first2=Lee R.|date=2008-04-29|title=Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=251–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinic deep water is a key component of the [[Canfield ocean]], a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the [[Boring Billion]] proposed by [[Donald Canfield]], an American geologist, in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|date=2008-08-15|title=Ironing Out Ocean Chemistry at the Dawn of Animal Life|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/923|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=923–924|doi=10.1126/science.1162870|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18703731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.

== Background ==
Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|last2=Anbar|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Severmann|first3=Silke|last4=Scott|first4=Clint|last5=Gill|first5=Benjamin C.|date=2009-04-27|title=Tracking Euxinia in the Ancient Ocean: A Multiproxy Perspective and Proterozoic Case Study|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=507–534|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small [[black shale]] deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_1|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|last=Torres|first=Martha E.

Sosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=D. E.|year=|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/24839|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of [[banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in [[iron sulfide]] (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic [[oxidant]] instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has become what is known as the [[Canfield ocean]], a model backed by the increase in presence of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sedimentary [[pyrite]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate [[evaporite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melezhik|first=Victor A.|last2=Fallick|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Rychanchik|first3=Dmitry V.|last4=Kuznetsov|first4=Anton B.|date=2005-04-01|title=Palaeoproterozoic evaporites in Fennoscandia: implications for seawater sulphate, the rise of atmospheric oxygen and local amplification of the δ13C excursion|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x/abstract|journal=Terra Nova|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x|issn=1365-3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anoxic event|Anoxia]] and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or "toxic" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in [[meromictic lakes]] and silled basins such as the [[Black Sea]] and some fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|600x600px|Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean]]
The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the presence of [[Sulfate|sulfate ions]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), organic matter (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|bacteria]] capable of reducing sulfate to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria utilize the [[redox]] potential of sulfate as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and organic matter as a [[Reducing agent|reductant]] to generate chemical energy through [[Anaerobic respiration|cellular respiration]]. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:

2CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the [[By-product|byproduct]] hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of oxygen and [[gas exchange]] between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in [[seabed]] [[sediment]]s that have a strong [[redox gradient]] and become [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] at some depth below the [[Sediment–water interface|sediment-water interface]]. In the ocean the [[Reaction rate|rate]] of these reactions is not [https://online.science.psu.edu/biol011_active002/node/4343 limited] by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative [[weathering]] of [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] became a major source of sulfate to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E. M.|year=1982|title=Sulphate and sulphate reduction in early Precambrian oceans|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5853/pdf/296145a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=296|pages=145–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|year=|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2688866|pmid=19451639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or [[nitrate]], so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[denitrifying bacteria]]. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include [[anoxic waters]], high [[nutrient]] levels, and a [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] water column.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the [[Canfield ocean]], are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the [[geologic record]] at relevant locations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nutrient traps ===
In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the [[photic zone]], supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}), comes from [[weathering]] of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=C. M.|last2=Mills|first2=M. M.|last3=Arrigo|first3=K. R.|last4=Berman-Frank|first4=I.|last5=Bopp|first5=L.|last6=Boyd|first6=P. W.|last7=Galbraith|first7=E. D.|last8=Geider|first8=R. J.|last9=Guieu|first9=C.|title=Processes and patterns of oceanic nutrient limitation|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1765|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=9|pages=701–710|doi=10.1038/ngeo1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Geography ====
[[File:FjordCirculation.JPG|thumb|399x399px|A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers.]]
The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to [[plate tectonics]], resulting in the [[bathymetry]] of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stratification ====
Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelburg|first=J.

=== Warming climate ===
A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the [[solubility]] of [[Ocean deoxygenation|oxygen decreases]], allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotinski|first=Roberta M.|year=2001|title=Ocean stagnation and end-Permian anoxia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235451836_Ocean_Stagnation_and_end_Permian_anoxia|journal=Geology|volume=29|pages=7–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Volcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Evidence for euxinic events ==

=== Black shale ===
[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]
Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Geochemistry ===
Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Isotopes ====
[[Stable isotope ratio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945435170|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) become equal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;  is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the [[Black Sea]], molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4−x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; ).&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=G.

Bacteria such as [[green sulfur bacteria]] (GSB) and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments.  These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pigments used to identify past presesnce of GSB are [[chlorobactane]] and [[isorenieratene]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Cypionka|first2=Heribert|last3=Pfennig|first3=Norbert|date=1992-01-01|title=An extremely low-light adapted phototrophic sulfur bacterium from the Black Sea|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=150–155|doi=10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments used to identify past presence of PSB is [[okenane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Sandmann|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hall|first3=Ken J.|last4=Northcote|first4=Tom G.|date=1993-03-01|title=Fossil carotenoids and paleolimnology of meromictic Mahoney Lake, British Columbia, Canada|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00877257|journal=Aquatic Sciences|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1007/BF00877257|issn=1015-1621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iron geochemistry ====
[[Pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and bioreactive iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy|last2=Severmann|first2=Silke|year=2006|title=A critical look at iron paleoredox proxies: New insights from modern euxinic marine basins|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=70|pages=5698–5722|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raiswell|first=R.|last2=Newton|first2=R.|last3=Wignall|first3=P.

== Euxinic events in Earth's history ==

  [[File:Timeline of euxinia in ancient oceans.png|thumb|660x660px|Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;]]

=== Proterozoic ===
The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the [[Banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|year=|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=361|issue=1470|pages=903–915|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1838|issn=0962-8436|pmid=16754606|via=|pmc=1578726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulton|first=Simon W.|last2=Fralick|first2=Philip W.|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|date=2004-09-09|title=The transition to a sulphidic ocean {{!}}[sim]{{!}} 1.84 billion years ago|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7005/full/nature02912.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=431|issue=7005|pages=173–177|doi=10.1038/nature02912|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the [[Boring Billion]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yanan|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E.|last3=Knoll|first3=Andrew H.|date=2002-02-01|title=Middle Proterozoic ocean chemistry: Evidence from the McArthur Basin, northern Australia|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/302/2/81|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=302|issue=2|pages=81–109|doi=10.2475/ajs.302.2.81|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found biomarkers for [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brocks|first=Jochen J.|last2=Love|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Summons|first3=Roger E.|last4=Knoll|first4=Andrew H.|last5=Logan|first5=Graham A.|last6=Bowden|first6=Stephen A.|date=2005-10-06|title=Biomarker evidence for green and purple sulphur bacteria in a stratified Palaeoproterozoic sea|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/abs/nature04068.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=437|issue=7060|pages=866–870|doi=10.1038/nature04068|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=C.|last2=Lyons|first2=T.

=== Phanerozoic ===
There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Paleozoic ====

The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. “Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.” ''Nature'' 469 (7328): 80–83. doi:10.1038/nature09700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Tatiana|last2=Strauss|first2=Harald|last3=Guo|first3=Qingjun|last4=Liu|first4=Congqiang|date=2007-10-08|title=Reconstructing marine redox conditions for the Early Cambrian Yangtze Platform: Evidence from biogenic sulphur and organic carbon isotopes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207001800|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|series=From Snowball Earth to the Cambrian bioradiation: calibration of Ediacaran-Cambrian history in South China|volume=254|issue=1–2|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodfellow|first=Wayne D|last2=Jonasson|first2=Ian R|year=1984|title=Data from ocean stagnation and ventilation defined by secular trends in pyrite and baritye, Selwyn Basin, Yukon|url=|journal=Geology|volume=12|pages=583–586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Tim K.|last2=Hardie|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Timofeeff|first3=Michael N.|last4=Demicco|first4=Robert V.|title=Secular variation in seawater chemistry and the origin of calcium chloride basinal brines|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG19728R.1|journal=Geology|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1130/g19728r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods. [[Isorenieratene]], a pigment known as a proxy for an anoxic photic zone, has been found in the geological record in Illinois and Michigan.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Todd C.|last2=Kenig|first2=Fabien|date=2004-12-02|title=Water column structure during deposition of Middle Devonian–Lower Mississippian black and green/gray shales of the Illinois and Michigan Basins: a biomarker approach|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204004523|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=215|issue=1–2|pages=59–85|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although present, these events were probably ephemeral and did not last for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shultz|first=Richard B|year=2006|title=Geochemical relationships of Late Paleozoic carbon-rich shales of the Midcontinent, USA: a compendium of results advocating changeable geochemical conditions|url=|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=206|pages=347–372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar periodic evidence of euxinia can also be found in the Sunbury shales of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Susan M.|date=2004-06-16|title=Geochemical paleoredox indicators in Devonian–Mississippian black shales, Central Appalachian Basin (USA)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254104000191|journal=Chemical Geology|series=Geochemistry of Organic-Rich Shales: New Perspectives|volume=206|issue=3–4|pages=373–391|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2003.12.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the [[Kellwasser event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=David|last2=Wignall|first2=Paul B.|last3=Racki|first3=Grzegorz|date=2004-03-01|title=Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/div-classtitleextent-and-duration-of-marine-anoxia-during-the-frasnianfamennian-late-devonian-mass-extinction-in-poland-germany-austria-and-francediv/E23779056D0B8D8520D5A7E04FFF5B1D|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=141|issue=2|pages=173–193|doi=10.1017/S0016756804008866|issn=1469-5081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the [[Carboniferous]], most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=K.

==== Mesozoic ====

The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct [[Ocean anoxic event|Ocean Anoxic Event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cenozoic ====
Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Modern euxinia ==
 
Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Meromictic lakes ===
[[Meromictic lake]]s are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for [[limnic eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|title=Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa|last=Tietze|first=Klaus|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|isbn=9783663052418|editor-last=Freeth|editor-first=Samuel J.|series=International Monograph Series|pages=97–107|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|editor-last2=Ofoegbu|editor-first2=Charles O.|editor-last3=Onuoha|editor-first3=K.

[[File:Mariager fjord vinter.jpg|thumb|Mariager fjord often produces a "rotten egg" smell in the summer due to sulfur content.]]

=== North Sea fjords ===
Some [[fjord]]s develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water.  Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Ketil B|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E|date=2004-02-01|title=Annual fluctuations in sulfur isotope fractionation in the water column of a euxinic marine basin 1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703703003879|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=68|issue=3|pages=503–515|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Framvaren Fjord ====

This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millero|first=Frank J.|date=1991-07-01|title=The oxidation of H2S in Framvaren Fjord|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=1007–1014|doi=10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Wensheng|last2=Millero|first2=Frank J.|title=The chemistry of the anoxic waters in the Framvaren Fjord, Norway|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01025231|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–88|doi=10.1007/BF01025231|issn=1380-6165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.

Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomova|first=Svetlana|last2=Braaten|first2=Hans Fredrik|last3=Yakushev|first3=Evgeniy|last4=Skei|first4=Jens|date=2014-04-28|year=|title=Biogeochemical consequences of an oxygenated intrusion into an anoxic fjord|url=http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/15/1/5|journal=Geochemical Transactions|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1186/1467-4866-15-5|issn=1467-4866|pmid=24872727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mariager Fjord ====

This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least 5 times in the last century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a [[harmful algal bloom]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Cariaco Basin ===
The [[Cariaco Basin]] in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werne|first=Josef P.|last2=Lyons|first2=Timothy W.|last3=Hollander|first3=David J.|last4=Formolo|first4=Michael J.|last5=Sinninghe Damsté|first5=Jaap S.|date=2003-04-15|title=Reduced sulfur in euxinic sediments of the Cariaco Basin: sulfur isotope constraints on organic sulfur formation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254102003935|journal=Chemical Geology|series=Isotopic records of microbially mediated processes|volume=195|issue=1–4|pages=159–179|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(02)00393-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W|last2=Werne|first2=Josef P|last3=Hollander|first3=David J|last4=Murray|first4=R.

Free sulfur exists deep in the water column and up to 6m in depth in the sediment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">The '''''Heidelberg Appeal''''', authored by [[Michel Salomon]], was an appeal directed against the findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;James Lawrence Powell: ''The Inquisition of Climate Science''. New York 2012, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; organised initially by the tobacco industry as part of its "junk-science" program. The Heidelberg Appeal's goal was similar to the later published [[Leipzig Declaration]] and an earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Allison |last2=Robinson |first2=John |date=2004 |title=RELEVANT BUT NOT PRESCRIPTIVE?

It was published at the last day of the [[Rio Summit]] 1992 and warned governments that they don't base their policy on environmental policy, which they regarded as "pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data."&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt; It was brought forward by the tobacco and asbestos industry, to support the climate-denying [[Global Climate Coalition]]. According to [[SourceWatch]] the appeal is "a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition". Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their "sound science" agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;

==Signed up for what?==

The technique used by Salomon's group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. It is important to realise that, at this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology.  They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.

The document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the 'go-to authorities' on all such health and environmental matters.  They didn't see this as a climate-denial statement.

One of the signatories, Nobel Prize winner [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], a professor of physics at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists.  He complained that despite science's disapproval, CFC's persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It's a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet's ecological degradation."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as &lt;blockquote&gt;''"clearly irrational?" [... ] "This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends." [such] forces "make the public afraid of science."'' 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-scientist.com/news/rio-document-spurs-debate-is-science-an-ecological-foe-60005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general 'motherhood' statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products.  However, when release and publicised by [[Fred Singer]]'s [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release.  It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.

==Success?==

The ''Heidelberg Appeal'' has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of [[global warming]] as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the [[Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation]], which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]], a group set up by Michael Salomon "that was considered important in [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]' plans to create a group in Europe similar to [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1446867 | pmid=11684592 | volume=91 | title=Junking science to promote tobacco | date=November 2001 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1745–8 | last1 = Yach | first1 = D | last2 = Bialous | first2 = SA | doi=10.2105/ajph.91.11.1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html International Center for A Scientific Ecology Guidelines for the Seminar on Linear Relationship for Risk Assessment of Low Doses of Carcinogens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014201129/http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html |date=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Originator ==

Michel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based "Projections" magazine. He was hired by Philip Morris to extend their junk-science program into Europe. They had already been highly successful with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt; TASSC ([[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]]) in the US under [[Steven Milloy]], &lt;br&gt; &lt;LI&gt; SEPP ([[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (run by Fred Singer) and semi-attached to TASSC.
&lt;LI&gt; ESEF ([[European Science and Environment Forum]]) run by [[Roger Bate]] on secondment from the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] in London.&lt;/ul&gt;

Following the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka "CIES") which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]] or, in French, the [[Centre International pour une Ecologie Scientifique]].  He wrote about the appeal:
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; ''... we brought together at Heidelberg about fifty well-known scientists, including Nobel Prize winners Rita Levi and Manfred Eigen, as well as medical practitioners, sociologists, moralists and members of the editorial staff of Projections. They came from a range of disciplines, from numerous European countries, including the former Soviet Union, and had divergent views on many questions. 

Why Heidelberg? We wanted to meet in a prestigious European university town. Oxford or Cambridge would have done just as well. The warm welcome we received at the beginning of our round of the university towns, from cardiologist Gothard Schettler, Vice President of the Academy of Science at Heidelberg, and from Professor Harald zur Hausen at the Cancer Research Institute, persuaded us to pitch our tent on the banks of the Neckar. As the substances in question were incriminated, among other things, for their supposed or real carcinogenic effects, we accepted Professor zur Hausen's generous hospitality.  

 The Heidelberg meeting was lively and fruitful. Experts in CFCs, dioxins, radiation and asbestos summarized the latest epidemiological and other research on the impact of these substances on health, and their conclusions were discussed by the members of the meeting. But the question of the coming ''' Earth Summit''' preoccupied the participants too much for them to stop at purely technical discussions. ''' We were therefore not overly surprised when numerous voices were raised wanting the group to discuss Rio and to adopt a definite position on the matter.'''

 &lt;u&gt;We had rather anticipated this reaction&lt;/u&gt;. An initial text which we had passed round friends in Paris had already attracted about fifty signatures. We presented it at Heidelberg. It was discussed paragraph by paragraph, word by word. The Heidelberg declaration in its present version was the result of those discussions. '' &lt;ref&gt;  Michel Salomon editorial Projections, April 14 1992.  http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/yqg80c00/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

The '''history of [[printing]]''' starts as early as 3500 BCE, when the Persian and Mesopotamian civilizations used [[cylinder seal]]s to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, pottery imprints and cloth printing. [[Woodblock printing]] on paper originated in China around 200 CE. It led to the development of [[movable type]] in the eleventh century and the spread of book production in East Asia. Woodblock printing was also used in Europe, but it was in the fifteenth century that European printers combined movable type and [[alphabet]]ic scripts to create an economical book publishing industry. This industry enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Alongside the development of text printing, new and lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including [[lithography]], [[screen printing]] and [[photocopying]].

[[Hand stencils]], made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, have been found in Asia and Europe dating from over 35,000 years ago, and later prehistoric dates in other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}} "The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world," said Dr Aubert. "Next to it is , and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one," he told BBC News. There are also paintings in the caves that are around 27,000 years old, which means that the inhabitants were painting for at least 13,000 years."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pike, A.

Stencils may have been used to colour cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in [[Katazome]] and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the [[Edo period]] in Japan.  In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to colour [[old master print]]s printed in black and white, usually [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be coloured by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 15, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written.

== Seals == 
[[File:King of Na gold seal.jpg|thumb|The [[King of Na gold seal]], bestowed by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] to Wana (Yayoi Japan) in 57 AD.]]

In China seals were used since at least the [[Shang dynasty]]. In the [[Western Zhou]], sets of seal stamps were encased in blocks of type and used on clay moulds for casting bronzes. By the end of the 3rd century BC seals were also used for printing on pottery. In the Northern dynasties textual sources contain references to wooden seals with up to 120 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

The seals had a religious element to them. [[Daoists]] used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto the flesh of sick people. They were also used to stamp food, creating a talismanic character to ward off disease. The first evidence of these practices appeared under a Buddhist context in the mid 5th century. Centuries later seals were used to create hundreds of Buddha images.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

== Stone and bronze blocks ==
Stone and bronze blocks have been used to print fabric. Archaeological evidence of them have been unearthed at [[Mawangdui]] and in the tomb of the King of [[Nanyue]], while block printed fabrics have been discovered at Mashan zhuanchang in [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]], [[Hubei]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In the 4th century the practice of creating paper rubbings of stone carvings such as calligraphic models and texts took hold. Among the earliest evidence of this is a stone inscription cut in mirror image from the early 6th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}

Woodblock printing (''diaoban yinshua'' 雕版印刷), known as xylography today, was the first method of printing applied to a paper medium. It became widely used throughout [[East Asia]] both as a method for printing on [[textile]]s and later, under the influence of [[Buddhism]], on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to about 220. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term [[woodcut]] (see below), except for the [[woodblock printing#Block-books in fifteenth century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Printing Timeline|url=https://printinghistory.org/timeline/|website=American Printing History Association: To Encourage the Study of Printing History|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legendary origins===
According to southern Chinese histories, during the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being had given him a "jade seal jade block writing," which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.'{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=60}} He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=50}} Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=61}}

===In the Sinosphere===
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The rise of printing was greatly influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of printing and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dhāraṇī (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in [[Xi'an]]. It is called the ''Great spell of unsullied pure light'' (''Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing'' 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650-670.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}} A similar piece, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the reign of [[Wu Zetian]], under which the [[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

Evidence of woodblock printing appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward. [[The Great Dharani Sutra]] ({{lang-ko|무구정광대다라니경|translit=Muggujeonggwang Daedharanigyeong [[Hanja]]: 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經}}) was discovered at [[Bulguksa]], [[South Korea]] in 1966 and dated between 704 and 751 in the era of [[Later Silla]]. The document is printed on a {{convert|8|x|630|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Paper Mulberry|mulberry]] paper scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea&amp;nbsp;— Silla Countrystudies.us] accessed 2009-12-03; [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm ''A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan''] - 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; [http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-9-korea.htm ''Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea''], Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= Cho Woo-suk, ''JoongAng Daily''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081555/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= |date=2011-07-19 }}, November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/newinfo/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01260600,37&amp;queryText=V_KDCD=11 National Treasure No. 126-6], by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+world+history:+ancient,+medieval,+and+modern%22+by+Peter+N.+Stearns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5dGg9u9uJ&amp;sig=u9uP_DdhfHi8qza6fEK1KldlhQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upboTP3MK8Kblge0-6nWCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/hightours/diamsutra/index.html The Xiantong era (咸通 Xián tōng) ran from 860-74, crossing the reigns of Yi Zong (懿宗 Yì zōng) and Xi Zong (僖宗 Xī zōng), see [[List of Tang Emperors]]. The book was thus prepared in the time of [[Yi Zong]].&lt;/ref&gt; A dhāraṇī sutra was printed in Japan around AD 770. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest extant evidence of woodblock prints created for the purpose of reading are portions of the [[Lotus Sutra]] discovered at [[Turpan]] in 1906. They have been dated to the reign of Wu Zetian using character form recognition.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest text containing a specific date of printing was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]] in 1907 by [[Aurel Stein]]. This copy of the [[Diamond Sutra]] is 14 feet long and contains a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the inner end, which reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''. It is considered the world's oldest securely-dated woodblock scroll.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The Diamond sutra was closely followed by the earliest extant printed almanac, the ''Qianfu sinian lishu'' (乾符四年曆書), dated to 877.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

From 932 to 955 the [[Thirteen Classics|Twelve Classics]] and an assortment of other texts were printed. During the [[Song dynasty]], the Directorate of education and other agencies used these block prints to disseminate their standardized versions of the ''Classics''. Other disseminated works include the ''Histories'', philosophical works, encyclopedias, collections, and books on medicine and the art of war.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 971 work began on the complete [[Tripiṭaka]] Buddhist Canon (''Kaibao zangshu'' 開寶藏書) in [[Chengdu]]. It took 10 years to finish the 130,000 blocks needed to print the text. The finished product, the [[Sichuan]] edition of the ''Kaibao canon'', also known as the ''Kaibao Tripitaka'', was printed in 983.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 989 [[Seongjong of Goryeo]] sent the monk Yeoga to request from the Song a copy of the complete Buddhist canon. The request was granted in 991 when Seongjong's official Han Eongong visited the Song court.&lt;ref&gt;https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1011, [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] issued the carving of their own set of the Buddhist canon, which would come to be known as the ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]''. The project was suspended in 1031 after Heyongjong's death, but work resumed again in 1046 after [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]]'s accession to the throne. The completed work, amounting to some 6,000 volumes, was finished in 1087. Unfortunately the original set of woodblocks was destroyed in a conflagration during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasion]] of 1232. King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] ordered another set to be created and work began in 1237, this time only taking 12 years to complete. In 1248 the complete ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]'' numbered 81,258 printing blocks, 52,330,152 characters, 1496 titles, and 6568 volumes. Due to the stringent editing process that went into the ''Goryeo Daejanggyeong'' and its surprisingly enduring nature, having survived completely intact over 760 years, it is considered the most accurate of Buddhist canons written in [[Classical Chinese]] as well as a standard edition for East Asian Buddhist scholarship.&lt;ref name="Memory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and miscellaneous Buddhist scriptures|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/printing-woodblocks-of-the-tripitaka-koreana-and-miscellaneous-buddhist-scriptures/|website=UNESCO Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of woodblock printing====
Prior to the introduction of printing, the size of private collections in China had already seen an increase since the invention of paper. Fan Ping (215-84) had in his collection 7,000 rolls (''juan''), or a few hundred titles. Two centuries later, Zhang Mian owned 10,000 ''juan'', [[Shen Yue]] (441-513) 20,000 ''juan'', and [[Xiao Tong]] and his cousin Xiao Mai both had collections of 30,000 ''juan''. [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (508-555) was said to have had a collection of 80,000 ''juan''. The combined total of all known private book collectors prior to the Song dynasty number around 200, with the Tang alone accounting for 60 of them.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Following the maturation of woodblock printing, official, commercial, and private publishing businesses emerged while the size and number of collections grew exponentially. The Song dynasty alone accounts for some 700 known private collections, more than triple the number of all the preceding centuries combined. Private libraries of 10-20,000 ''juan'' became commonplace while six individuals owned collections of over 30,000 ''juan''. The earliest extant private Song library catalogue lists 1,937 titles in 24,501 ''juan''. Zhou Mi's collection numbered 42,000 ''juan'', Chen Zhensun's collection lists 3,096 titles in 51,180 ''juan'', and [[Ye Mengde]] (1077-1148) as well as one other individual owned libraries of 6,000 titles in 100,000 ''juan''. The majority of which were secular in nature. Texts contained material such as medicinal instruction or came in the form of a ''[[leishu]]'' (類書), a type of encyclopedic reference book used to help [[imperial examinations|examination]] candidates.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Imperial establishments such as the Three Institutes: Zhaowen Institute, History Institute, and Jixian Institute also followed suit. At the start of the dynasty the Three Institutes' holdings numbered 13,000 ''juan'', by the year 1023 39,142 ''juan'', by 1068 47,588 ''juan'', and by 1127 73,877 ''juan''. The Three Institutes were one of several imperial libraries, with eight other major palace libraries, not including imperial academies.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=43}} According to Weng Tongwen, by the 11th century, central government offices were saving tenfold by substituting earlier manuscripts with printed versions.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=21}} The impact of woodblock printing on Song society is illustrated in the following exchange between [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and Xing Bing in the year 1005:

{{quotation|The emperor went to the Directorate of Education to inspect the Publications Office. He asked Xing Bing how many woodblocks were kept there. Bing replied, "At the start of our dynasty, there were fewer than four thousand. Today, there are more than one hundred thousand. The classics and histories, together with standard commentaries, are all fully represented. When I was young and devoted myself to learning, there were only one or two scholars in every hundred who possessed copies of all the classics and commentaries. There was no way to copy so many works. Today, printed editions of these works are abundant, and officials and commoners alike have them in their homes. Scholars are fortunate indeed to have been born in such an era as ours!{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=33}}}}

In 1076, the 39 year old [[Su Shi]] remarked upon the unforeseen effect an abundance of books had on examination candidates:

{{quotation|I can recall meeting older scholars, long ago, who said that when they were young they had a hard time getting their hands on a copy of ''Shiji'' or ''Han shu''. If they were lucky enough to get one, they thought nothing of copying the entire text out by hand, so they could recite it day and night. In recent years merchants engrave and print all manner of books belonging to the hundred schools, and produce ten thousand pages a day. With books so readily available, you would think that students' writing and scholarship would be many times better than what they were in earlier generations. Yet, to the contrary, young men and examination candidates leave their books tied shut and never look at them, preferring to amuse themselves with baseless chatter. Why is this?{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=38}}}}

Woodblock printing also changed the shape and structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (經摺裝) from the Tang period onward. The advantage was that it was now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (''xuanfeng zhuang'' 旋風裝) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like an accordion.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}}

Around the year 1000, butterfly binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images to be easily replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |accessdate=2000-03-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540 ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the productive effect of woodblock printing, historian Endymion Wilkinson notes that it never supplanted handwritten manuscripts. Indeed, manuscripts remained dominant until the very end of Imperial China:

{{quotation|As a result of block-printing technology, it became easier and cheaper to produce multiple copies of books quickly. By the eleventh century, the price of books had fallen by about one tenth what they had been before and as a result they were more widely disseminated. Nevertheless, even in the fifteenth century most books in major libraries were still in manuscript, not in print. Almost to the end of the empire it remained cheaper to pay a copyist than to buy a printed book. Seven hundred and fifty years after the first imperially sponsored printed works in the Northern Song, the greatest book project of the eighteenth century, the ''[[Siku quanshu]]'' 四庫全書, was produced as a manuscript, not as a printed collection. About 4 percent of it was printed in movable type in 1773, but it was hand-carved movable wooden type. Indeed, the entire collection was only printed for the first time in the 1980s. Access to books, especially large works, such as the ''Histories'', remained difficult right into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910-911}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Not only did manuscripts remain competitive with imprints, they were even ''preferred'' by elite scholars and collectors. The age of printing gave the act of copying by hand a new dimension of cultural reverence. Those who considered themselves real scholars and true connoisseurs of the book did not consider imprints to be real books. Under the elitist attitudes of the time, "printed books were for those who did not truly care about books."{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=41}}

However it should be noted that copyists and manuscript only continued to remain competitive with printed editions by dramatically reducing their price. According to the [[Ming dynasty]] author [[Hu Yinglin]], "if no printed edition were available on the market, the hand-copied manuscript of a book would cost ten times as much as the printed work,"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} also "once a printed edition appeared, the transcribed copy could no longer be sold and would be discarded."{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} The result is that despite the mutual co-existence of hand-copied manuscripts and printed texts, the cost of the book had declined by about 90 percent by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} As a result, literacy increased. In 1488, the [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Choe Bu]] observed during his trip to China that "even village children, ferrymen, and sailors" could read, although this applied mainly to the south while northern China remained largely illiterate.{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=636}}

===In India===
Nine inscribed copper plates thought to belong to the mature [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing.&lt;ref&gt;Shinde, V. &amp; Willis, R.J., (2014).

In Buddhism, great merit is thought to accrue from copying and preserving texts. The 4th-century{{Fix|text=which?}} master{{Fix|text=who?}} listed the copying of scripture as the first of ten essential religious practices. The importance of perpetuating texts is set out with special force in the [[Infinite Life Sutra|longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which urges the devout not only to hear, learn, remember and study the text but to obtain a good copy and to preserve it. This "cult of the book" led to techniques for reproducing texts in great numbers, especially the short prayers or charms known as ''dhāraṇīs''. Stamps were carved for printing these prayers on clay tablets from at least the 7th century, the date of the oldest surviving examples.&lt;ref&gt;Zwalf, ''Buddhism: Art and Faith'' (London: British Museum, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
{{see also|History of Western typography}}
Printing with a press was practiced in Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing cards]] printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards.&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p ?, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}

Around the mid-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440–1460.&lt;ref name="Reference B"&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movable type (1041)==

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of typography in East Asia}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of [[printing]] and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]].

===Ceramic movable-type===
Movable-type was invented in the [[Northern Song dynasty]] around the year 1041 by the commoner [[Bi Sheng]]. Bi Sheng's movable-type was fired in [[porcelain]]. After his death, the ceramic movable-type passed onto his descendants. The next mention of movable-type occurred in 1193 when a Southern Song chief counselor, Zhou Bida (周必大), attributed the movable-type method of printing to [[Shen Kuo]]. However Shen Kuo did not invent the movable-type but credited it to Bi Sheng in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. The ceramic movable-type was also mentioned by [[Kublai Khan]]'s councilor [[Yao Shu]], who convinced his pupil [[Yang Gu]] to print language primers using this method.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Wooden movable type===
Bi Sheng also developed wooden movable type, but it was abandoned in favor of ceramic types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin|authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|title=Paper and Printing|volume=vol. 5 part 1|series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|ISBN= 0-521-08690-6|pages=201–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shen Kua: Dream Pool Essay&lt;/ref&gt; However wooden movable type had evidently reached the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] to the west by the 12th century. There, the Tanguts printed the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]], a 449-page text considered to be the earliest extant example of a text printed using the wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Zhen (inventor)|Wang Zhen]], who lived in the [[Yuan dynasty]], also described the wooden movable type in his ''Book of Agriculture'' (''Nongshu'' 農書) of 1313.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

{{quotation|Now, however, there is another method [beyond earthenware type] that is both more exact and more convenient. A compositor's form is made of wood, strips of bamboo are used to mark the lines and a block is engraved with characters. The block is then cut into squares with a small fine saw till each character forms a separate piece. These separate characters are finished off with a knife on all four sides, and compared and tested till they are exactly the same height and size. Then the types are placed in the columns [of the form] and bamboo strips which have been prepared are pressed in between them. After the types have all been set in the form, the spaces are filled in with wooden plugs, so that the type is perfectly firm and will not move. When the type is absolutely firm, the ink is smeared on and printing begins.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 206 207"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;|Wang Zhen}}

Wang Zhen used two rotating circular tables as trays for laying out his type. The first table was separated into 24 trays in which each movable type was categorized based on a number corresponding with a rhyming pattern. The second table contained miscellaneous characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Using more than 30,000 wooden movable types, Wang Zhen printed a hundred copies of his county gazetteer, ''Records of Jingde County'' (''Jingde xianzhi'' 旌德縣志), a text containing more than 60,000 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Wooden movable type printing became relatively common during the [[Ming dynasty]] and became widespread during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Metal movable type===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|''Jikji'', ''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Seon Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris.]]

[[File:Beijing.Musee imprimerie.caracteres mobiles.Bisheng.jpg|thumb|Models of Bi Sheng's revolving typecase tables.]]

Metal movable type appeared in the late Song and Yuan. Bronze movable types were used to print [[banknotes]] and official documents by both the Song and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jin dynasty, copper-block prints were slotted with two square holes for embedding bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money had a different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper banknote dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters: one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'', for the purpose of preventing counterfeit. Over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole; apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal movable type was received more positively in Korea where its methods were understood sometime before 1232 under [[Goryeo]]. The oldest known book to have been printed by using cast metal type is the ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'', by [[Choe Yun-ui]], in 1234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=Hye Ok | date=July 2014 |title=The History of Pre-Gutenberg Woodblock and Movable Type Printing in Korea |trans-title= |url=http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_9_1_July_2014/2.pdf |language=English |journal=International Journal of Humanities and Social Science |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all 50 original volumes of the book seem to have been lost.

Tin movable type is mentioned in Wang Zhen's ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (造活字印書法) of 1298, but it was considered unsatisfactory due to incompatibility with the inking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of movable type in the Sinosphere===
Movable type printing was hardly used for the first 300 years after its invention by Bi Sheng. Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of [[Hangeul]] was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand if there was no intention of producing more than a few copies. Although [[Sejong the Great]] introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced [[Hanja]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}} And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society:

{{quotation|Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April -June , 1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96-103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;|Sohn Pow-Key}}

Only during the Ming and Qing dynasties did wooden and metal movable types see any considerable use, but the preferred method remained woodblock. Usage of movable type in China never exceeded 10 percent of all printed materials while 90 percent of printed books used the older woodblock technology. In one case an entire set of wooden type numbering 250,000 pieces was used for firewood.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}} Woodblocks remained the dominant printing method in China until the introduction of [[lithography]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

In Japan the use of printing beyond its Buddhist origins was insignificant for centuries after its introduction. Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The ''Setsuyō-shū'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|invasions of Korea]], which brought back artisans and printing equipment in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]'s orders, the [[Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is generally considered to be the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode of printing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). "A History of Japan: 1334-1615." Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Traditionally it has been assumed that the prevalence of woodblock printing in East Asia as a result of Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his ''Five Hundred Years of Printing'' as having "outlived their usefulness" and their printed material as "cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}} John Man's ''The Gutenberg Revolution'' makes a similar case: "wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and then you had to carve another one - a whole page at a time."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}}

Recent commentaries on printing in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett points out that only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both xylography and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that "the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} [[Matteo Ricci]] made note of "the exceedingly large numbers of books in circulation here and the ridiculously low prices at which they are sold."{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=637}} Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, by way of the [[Macartney Embassy|Macartney mission]] to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was "as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in [[History of China|China]] had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said:

{{quotation|We have an extensive penny literature at home, but the [[English people|English]] cottager cannot buy anything like the amount of printed matter for his penny that the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] can for even less. A penny Prayer-book, admittedly sold at a loss, cannot compete in mass of matter with many of the books to be bought for a few [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]] in China. When it is considered, too, that a block has been laboriously cut for each leaf, the cheapness of the result is only accounted for by the wideness of sale.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=14}}}}

Other modern scholars such as Endymion Wilkinson hold a more conservative and skeptical view. While Wilkinson does not deny "China's dominance in book production from the fourth to the fifteenth century," he also insists that arguments for the Chinese advantage "should not be extended either forwards or backwards in time."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

It is traditionally surmised that [[Johannes Gutenberg]], of the German city of [[Mainz]], developed European movable type printing technology with the [[printing press]] around 1439&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; and in just over a decade, the European age of printing began. However, the evidence shows a more complex evolutionary process, [[Spread of the printing press|spread over multiple locations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/discover_science/gberg_synopsis.html Review of research by Paul Needham and Blaise Aguera y Arcas at the BBC / Open University]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]] experimented with Gutenberg in Mainz.

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page-setting was quicker and more durable. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and [[printing press]]es rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium". See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=2007-10-12 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional [[goldsmith]], Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an [[alloy]] of lead, tin, and [[antimony]], known as [[type metal]], printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.

The invention of the printing press revolutionized communication and book production, leading to the spread of knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A printing press was built in [[Venice]] in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 [[Johann Heynlin]] set up a printing press in [[Paris]]. In 1473 [[Kasper Straube]] published the ''[[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]]'' in [[Kraków]]. [[Dirk Martens]] set up a printing press in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ([[Flanders]]) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of [[Enea Piccolomini]] who became [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1476 a printing press was set up in England by [[William Caxton]]. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in [[Mexico City]] in 1539. The first [[printing press]] in [[Southeast Asia]] was set up in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first printing press to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, Marion B.

The Gutenberg press was much more efficient than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of [[John Baskerville]] and [[Giambattista Bodoni]], over 300 years later.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130–133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800, Lord Stanhope had constructed a press completely from cast iron, reducing the force required by 90% while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; While Stanhope's "mechanical theory" had improved the efficiency of the press, it was only capable of 250 sheets per hour.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] was the first to design a non-manpowered machine—using steam.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; He moved to London in 1804, and met [[Thomas Bensley]]; he secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; With a patent in 1810, Koenig designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811.

===Flat-bed printing press===
{{Main|Printing press|Spread of the printing press}}
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|Printing press from 1811, photographed in Munich, Germany.]]
A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring an image. The systems involved were first assembled in [[Germany]] by the [[goldsmith]] [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing methods based on Gutenberg's printing press spread rapidly throughout first [[Spread of the printing press|Europe and then the rest of the world]], replacing most block printing and making it the sole progenitor of modern movable type printing. As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, The printing press has been superseded by the advent of [[offset printing]].

Johannes Gutenberg's work in the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen—a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; It was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that official record exists; witnesses testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and his type mold.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Others in Europe were developing movable type at this time, including goldsmith Procopius Waldfoghel of France and [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; They are not known to have contributed specific advances to the printing press.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; While the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the company now states that is incorrect.&lt;ref name="britannica_web_coster"&gt;''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36788/typography Typography - Gutenberg and printing in Germany].''

===Printing houses in Europe===
Early printing houses (near the time of Gutenberg) were run by "master printers." These printers owned shops, selected and edited manuscripts, determined the sizes of print runs, sold the works they produced, raised capital and organized distribution. Some master printing houses, like that of [[Aldus Manutius]], became the cultural center for [[Intellectual|literati]] such as [[Erasmus]].

*Print shop apprentices: Apprentices, usually between the ages of 15 and 20, worked for master printers. Apprentices were not required to be literate, and literacy rates at the time were very low, in comparison to today. Apprentices prepared ink, dampened sheets of paper, and assisted at the press. An apprentice who wished to learn to become a compositor had to learn Latin and spend time under the supervision of a journeyman.
*Journeyman printers: After completing their apprenticeships, ''journeyman''  printers were free to move employers. This facilitated the spread of printing to areas that were less print-centred.
*Compositors: Those who set the type for printing.
*Pressmen: the person who worked the press. This was physically labour-intensive.

The earliest-known image of a European, Gutenberg-style print shop is the ''Dance of Death'' by Matthias Huss, at Lyon, 1499. This image depicts a compositor standing at a compositor's case being grabbed by a skeleton. The case is raised to facilitate his work.  At the right of the printing house a bookshop is shown.

====Financial aspects====
According to court records from the city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's financial backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures{{clarify|date=June 2017}} supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the bookseller—publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent on the nature of the publication.

Bookseller publishers negotiated at trade fairs and at print shops. Jobbing work appeared: some printers performed menial tasks at the beginning of their careers to support themselves.

From 1500–1700 publishers developed several new methods of funding projects:

# Cooperative associations/publication syndicates—a number of individuals shared the risks associated with printing and shared in the profit. This was pioneered by the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
# Subscription publishing: pioneered by the English in the early 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A prospectus for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who signed up for a copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.
# Installment publishing: books were issued in parts until a complete book had been issued. This was not necessarily done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost over a period of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.

The ''Mechanick Exercises'', by Joseph Moxon, in London, 1683, was said to be the first publication in installments.&lt;ref name="serial"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiles |first1=R. M. |date= |year=2012 |title=Serial Publication in England Before 1750 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=SL2gM5RygKwC |access-date=|format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=79 |pages= |isbn= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishing trade organizations allowed publishers to organize business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher did something to irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as [[cartel]]s, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.

In most cases, publishers bought the [[copyright]] in a work from the author, and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required a substantial amount of capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.

====Rotary printing press====
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
In a rotary printing press, the impressions are carved around a cylinder so that the printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]], or a large number of other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] in 1863.

==Intaglio==
[[File:Intaglio-printing.svg|thumb|right|Intaglio printing. The top line is the paper, to which a slightly raised layer of ink adheres; the matrix is beneath]]
{{Main|Intaglio (printmaking)}}
Intaglio ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|t|æ|l|i|oʊ}}) is a family of [[printmaking]] techniques in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]]. [[Collography|Collographs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.  To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes with the aid of newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.

==Lithography (1796)==
[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich.]][[File:Lithography stone Princeton motif.jpg|thumb|stone used for a lithograph with a view of [[Princeton University]]
(Collection: Princeton University Library, NJ)]]
{{Main|Lithography}}
Invented by Bavarian author [[Aloys Senefelder]] in 1796,&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. ©1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''lithography''' is a method for printing on a smooth surface. Lithography is a printing process that uses chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image would be a [[hydrophobic]] chemical, while the negative image would be water. Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows for a relatively flat print plate which allows for much longer runs than the older physical methods of imaging (e.g., embossing or engraving).
High-volume lithography is used today to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging — just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[offset lithography]].

In offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used in place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]]. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.

==Color printing==
{{Main|Colour printing|Woodcut}}
[[File:Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert Lithographic Company, Detroit, MI. ''Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish,'' c. 1880. Noel Wisdom Chromolithograph Collection, Special Collections Department, The University of South Florida Tampa Library.]]
According to Michael Sullivan, the earliest known example of color printing "is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346". Color printing continued to be used in China throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chromolithography]] became the most successful of several methods of [[colour printing]] developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] and [[Edmund Evans]], and mostly relied on using several [[woodcut|woodblocks]] with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875.  Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeing.nypl.org/planographic.html|title=Planographic Printing|date=1999-10-23|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=The New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers.  However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image.  Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.&lt;ref&gt;Clapper, Michael. "'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo." American Art 16(2002): 16-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aloys Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 ''Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)'', where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished to be able to print someday.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"&gt;Ferry, Kathryn. "Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography." ''Architectural History'' 46(2003): 175–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as [[France]] and [[England]], were also trying to find a new way to print in color. [[Godefroy Engelmann]] of [[Mulhouse]] in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837,&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt; but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt;

==Offset press (1870s)==
{{Main|Offset press}}
Offset printing is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

==Screenprinting (1907)==
{{Main|Screenprinting}}
Screenprinting has its origins in simple [[stencil]]ling, most notably of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] form ([[katazome]]), used who cut banana leaves and inserted ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in [[England]]. This idea was then adopted in [[San Francisco, California]], by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor [[Printmaking|prints]] in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.

==Flexography==
{{Main|Flexography}}
[[File:Flexography-Platecloseup.JPG|thumb|right|A flexographic printing plate.]]
Flexography (also called "surface printing"), often abbreviated to "flexo", is a method of [[printing]] most commonly used for packaging (labels, tape, bags, boxes, banners, and so on).

A flexo print is achieved by creating a mirrored master of the required image as a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[relief]] in a [[rubber]] or [[polymer]] material.  A measured amount of [[ink]] is deposited upon the surface of the printing plate (or printing cylinder) using an [[anilox]] roll. The print surface then rotates, contacting the print material which transfers the ink.

Originally flexo printing was basic in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed Offset until recently. In the last few years great advances have been made to the quality of flexo printing presses.

The greatest advances though have been in the area of PhotoPolymer Printing Plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. —usually [[photography|photographic]] exposure followed by chemical etch, though also by direct [[laser engraving]].

==Photocopier (1960s)==
{{Main|Photocopier}}
Xerographic office photocopying was introduced by [[Xerox]] in the  1960s, and over the following 20 years it gradually replaced copies made by Verifax, [[Photostat]], [[carbon paper]], [[mimeograph machine]]s, and other [[duplicating machines]]. Its availability is one of the factors that rendered undesirable the development of the [[paperless office]] heralded early in the [[digital revolution]].

==Dot matrix printer (1968)==
{{Main|Dot matrix printing}}
A dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of [[computer printer]] with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a [[typewriter]]. Unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.  Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create [[Carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[Carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a "wire" or "pin", which is driven forward by  the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]] [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4194846.html]) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.

The first dot-matrix [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were invented in Japan.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Allen Kent, James G. Williams (1990), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ajpoqYqFrkQC&amp;pg=PA298 ''Encyclopedia of Microcomputers: Volume 6'', page 298], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Japanese manufacturer [[Epson]] released the [[EP-101]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.dphotographer.co.uk/news/40-years-since-epsons-first-electronic-printer%E2%80%A6/ 40 years since Epson’s first Electronic Printer], Digital Photographer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.epson-europe.com/eu/epson_eu/about_us.html About Epson], [[Epson]]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's first dot-matrix printer.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; The same year, Japanese manufacturer [[OKI (company)|OKI]] introduced the first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the [[OKI Wiredot]].&lt;ref name="IPSJ_2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Processing Technology Heritage - Wiredot printer |date=2012 |publisher=[[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) |url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031182147/http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |archive-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI's Wiredot Printer Receives Information Processing Technology Heritage Certification in Japan |location=Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA |date=2013-03-14 |url=http://www.okidata.com/oki-datas-wiredot-printer-receives-heritage-certification |access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_2"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI Printer aus 1968 als technologisch wertvolles Erbe ausgezeichnet |language=German |date=2013-03-26 |url=http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm:93-153208-16 |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031183409/http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm%3A93-153208-16 |archive-date=2016-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal printer==
{{Main|Thermal printer}}
A thermal printer (or direct thermal printer) produces a printed image by selectively heating coated [[thermochromic paper]], or [[thermal paper]] as it is commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal [[Computer printer|print head]]. The coating turns [[black]] in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.

==Laser printer (1969)==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pa 1977 9700-medium.jpg|right|thumb|left|Xerox 9700 laser printer (ca. 1977)]] --&gt;
The laser printer, based on a modified xerographic copier, was invented at [[Xerox]] in 1969 by researcher [[Gary Starkweather]], who had a fully functional networked printer system working by 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology | author = Edwin D.

The first commercial implementation of a laser printer was the [[IBM]] [[IBM model 3800 laser printer|model 3800]] in 1976, used for high-volume printing of documents such as invoices and mailing labels. It is often cited as "taking up a whole room," implying that it was a primitive version of the later familiar device used with a [[personal computer]]. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.

The first laser printer designed for use with an individual computer was released with the [[Xerox Star]] 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by a small number of laboratories and institutions. After [[personal computer]]s became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[LaserJet]] 8ppm, released in 1984, using a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from [[Brother Industries]], IBM, and others.

Most noteworthy was the role the laser printer played in popularizing [[desktop publishing]] with the introduction of the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] for the Apple [[Macintosh]], along with [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional [[typesetting]].

==Inkjet printer==
{{Main|Inkjet printer}}
Inkjet printers are a type of [[computer printer]] that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid [[ink]] onto paper.

==Dye-sublimation printer==
{{Main|Dye-sublimation printer}}
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a [[computer printer]] which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper.  The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised [[CMYK]] colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints.

==Digital press (1993)==
{{Main|Digital printing}}

Digital printing is the reproduction of [[digital images]] on a physical surface, such as [[paper|common]] or [[photographic paper]] or paperboard-cover stock, [[photographic film|film]], [[cloth]], [[plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[magnets]], [[labels]] etc.

It can be differentiated from [[Lithograph|litho]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]] or [[letterpress]] printing in many ways, some of which are;
* Every impression made onto the paper can be different, as opposed to making several hundred or thousand impressions of the same image from one set of printing plates, as in traditional methods.
* The [[Ink]] or [[Toner]] does not absorb into the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a layer on the surface and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).
* It generally requires less waste in terms of chemicals used and paper wasted in set up or makeready (bringing the image "up to color" and checking position).
* It is excellent for rapid prototyping, or small print runs which means that it is more accessible to a wider range of designers and more cost effective in short runs.

==Frescography (1998)==
[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]   
[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for designing frescographies.]]{{Main|Frescography}}   
'''Frescography''' is a method for reproduction/creation of [[mural]]s using [[digital printing]] methods, invented in 1998 by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a [[database]]. [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with [[low resolution]] motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall [[mural]]. Once a design is finished, the [[low resolution]] motifs are converted into the original [[high resolution]] images and are printed on canvas by [[Wide-format printer]]s. The canvas then can be applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]hanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.

==3D printing==
{{Main|3D printing}}
Three-dimensional printing is a method of converting a virtual [[3D model]] into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of [[rapid prototyping]] technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers on top of the previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to use than other additive fabrication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |title=Close-Up On Technology - 3D Printers Lead Growth of Rapid Prototyping - 08/04&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144538/http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |archive-date=2010-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological developments==

===Woodcut===
{{main|Woodcut}}
Woodcut is a [[relief printing]] artistic technique in printmaking in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike [[wood engraving]] where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe [[beech]]wood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of [[cherry]] wood was popular.

Woodcut first appeared in ancient China. From 6th century onward, woodcut icons became popular and especially flourished in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Since the 10th century, woodcut pictures appeared as illustrations in Chinese books, on [[banknote]]s such as [[Jiaozi (currency)]], and as single sheet images. Woodcut [[New Year picture]]s are also very popular with the Chinese.

In China and Tibet printed images mostly remained tied as illustrations to accompanying text until the modern period. The earliest woodblock printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] contains a large image as frontispiece, and many Buddhist texts contain some images. Later some notable Chinese artists designed woodcuts for books, the individual print develop in China in the form of [[New Year picture]] as an art-form in the way it did in Europe and Japan.

In Europe, woodcut is the oldest technique used for [[old master print]]s, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards, and many [[popular prints]] were very crude. The development of [[hatching]] followed on rather later than in [[engraving]]. [[Michael Wolgemut]] was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]] was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or [[etching]]). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the ''single-leaf'' (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.

===Engraving===
{{Main|Engraving}}
Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[steel]] are engraved, or may provide an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of [[copper]] or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic [[printmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by [[photography]] in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are ''copper-plate engraving'' and ''[[Line engraving]]''. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving that could be carried out is evident in the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing.

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

===Etching===
{{Main|Etching}}
Etching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal (the original process—in modern manufacturing other chemicals may be used on other types of material). As an intaglio method of printmaking it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains widely used today.

===Halftoning===
{{Main|Halftone}}
Halftone is the [[reprographic]] technique that simulates ones it is [[continuous tone]] imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. ©2000 Chronicle, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;

The idea of halftone printing originates from [[William Fox Talbot]]. In the early 1850s he suggested using "photographic screens or veils" in connection with a photographic [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process.&lt;ref name=twyman1970&gt;Twyman, Michael. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, London 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Galarneau |first=Claude |title=Desbarats, George-Édouard-Amable |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/desbarats_george_edouard_12E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the ''Canadian Illustrated News'' which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101009/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/cin/026019-119.01-e.php] Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the ''New York Daily Graphic'' in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.

The first truly successful commercial method was patented by [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Frederic Ives]] of [[Philadelphia]] in 1881.&lt;ref name="twyman1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meggs (1998), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; But although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes he did not make use of a screen. In 1882 the German [[George Meisenbach]] patented a halftone process in England. His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve  any commercial success with [[relief print|relief]] halftones.&lt;ref name=twyman1970/&gt;

===Xerography===
{{Main|Xerography}}
Xerography (or electrophotography) is a [[photocopying]] technique developed by [[Chester Carlson]] in 1938 and [[patent]]ed on October 6, 1942. He received {{US patent|2297691}} for his [[invention]]. The name xerography came from the Greek radicals ''xeros'' (dry) and ''graphos'' (writing), because there are no liquid chemicals involved in the process, unlike earlier reproduction techniques like [[cyanotype]].

In 1938 [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]] [[Georgi Nadjakov]] found that when placed into electric field and exposed to light, some dielectrics acquire permanent electric polarization in the exposed areas.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101024139/http://www.issp.bas.bg/lab/ephi/Museum/acad_GNadjakov/GN11-page5.html] That polarization persists in the dark and is destroyed in light.
[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]] and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in [[New York City]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with [[photoconductivity]]. Carlson experimented with "[[electrophotography]]" in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first "photocopy" using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words "10-22-38 Astoria" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric|GE]], neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Woodblock printing ==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing. "On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries", in ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', 1997, Vol. 42, No. 12: 976–981. ISSN 1001-6538. Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150" /&gt;

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

== Movable type ==
{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types.

In the 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], there is mention of [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

=== Movable type in Japan ===
Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). ''A History of Japan: 1334–1615''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

==History==
In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.  Measuring sea level rise is a complicated affair, however the IPCC have projected an increase in global mean sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-definition-global-mean-sea-level-gmsl-and-its-rate|title=What is the definition of global mean sea level (GMSL) and its rate? {{!}} CU Sea Level Research Group|website=sealevel.colorado.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of between 0.44m and 0.74m by 2100.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2007|title=Fourth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_full_report.pdf|journal=|volume=|issue=AR4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low-lying coastal islands such as Male', in the Maldives, a sea level rise of 0.5 metres would inundate 15 per cent of the island by 2025, and flood half of it by 2100.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As 42 per cent of the population lives within 100m within the coastline, even partial flooding is likely to result in drowning, injury and loss of life.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life. There is difficulty in studying the impacts of climate change itself because of the issue of scale; climate change is measured in decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is more than 95 per cent chance that [[anthropogenic climate change]] quadrupled the risk of extreme summer heat events in Europe in the decade 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christidis|first=Nikolaos|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth S.|last4=Shiogama|first4=Hideo|last5=Nozawa|first5=Toru|last6=Luterbacher|first6=Jürg|date=2012-02-01|title=Human activity and anomalously warm seasons in Europe|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2262/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=225–239|doi=10.1002/joc.2262|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a probability of 75 per cent that the 2003 heat wave in Europe was attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On this basis, the excess mortality rate from this event registered at 15,000 deaths in France alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouillet|first=A.|last2=Rey|first2=G.|last3=Laurent|first3=F.|last4=Pavillon|first4=G.|last5=Bellec|first5=S.|last6=Guihenneuc-Jouyaux|first6=C.|last7=Clavel|first7=J.|last8=Jougla|first8=E.|last9=Hémon|first9=Denis|title=Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4259">'''Jonathan Høegh von Leunbach''' ['lɔjnbɑk] (16 December 1884 - 24 September 1955)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/Jonathan-Hoegh-Leunbach/6000000018966190264&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] doctor.  During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5689">'''Lesbian Art Project''' (1977&amp;nbsp;– 1979) was a [[participatory art]] movement founded by [[Terry Wolverton]] and [[Arlene Raven]] at the [[Woman's Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project| pmid=20408013 | doi=10.1080/10894160903196541 | volume=14| issue=2| journal=J Lesbian Stud| pages=238–59 | last1 = Klein | first1 = J| year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering project focused on giving a platform to [[lesbian]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] perspectives of participants through [[performance]], [[Art|art making]], [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], [[Workshop|workshops]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref name="Journal of Lesbian studies"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project|author=Jennie Kelin|doi=10.1080/10894160903196541|pmid=20408013|volume=14|issue=2|journal=J Lesbian Stud|pages=238–59|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant piece of work created during the project was ''An Oral [[Herstory]] of Lesbianism'', in 1979, which documented lesbian women and their feelings, views, experiences, and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wack!

The Lesbian Art Project was part of an ongoing effort by [[Arlene Raven]], co-founder of the [[Woman's Building|LA Woman's Building]], to incorporate lesbian-oriented programming into the [[Woman's Building#Feminist Studio Workshop|Feminist Studio Workshop]], which had already launched the Los Angeles League for the Advancement of Lesbianism in the Arts (LALALA) in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787515|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTyBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq|editor=Bonnie Zimmerman|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and artists influenced by the tenets of [[postmodernism]] dismissed much of the art work made in the 1970s from a lesbian feminist perspective. This has resulted in very little being known or written about this pioneering work. The activities and events associated with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles have played a larger role in lesbian [[art history]] than is often acknowledged. The project began with six women (started by Terry Wolverton) working collectively with a common goal of increasing opportunity for lesbian artists and writing a chapter of lesbian art.  This small group disbanded in less than a year but Wolverton and Raven continued in their pursuit of a Lesbian Art Movement.  As they continued their project they became astonishingly productive, and they were able to integrate the Lesbian Art Project with the curriculum of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman’s Building.

At the Woman's Building they were able to organize a major performance event based on lesbian identities: ''The Oral Herstory of Lesbianism (Oral)''. Advertised as "Storytelling, Theater and Magic for Women Only",&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Norma, and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. "The power of feminist art: The American movement of the 1970s, history and impact." (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the project was directed by Wolverton and its stories generated through a workshop for the thirteen performers.

Along with the major performance event, a database for lesbian artists was now in existence. Wolverton and Raven went their separate ways before completing the book they had planned but both continued to individually promote feminist and lesbian art.     
  
A partial successor to the LAP was the 1980 [[Great American Lesbian Art Show]] (GALAS), also at the Woman's Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Identity Kit: The Great American Lesbian Art Show|last = Thompson|first = Margo Hobbs|date = 20 April 2010|journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume = 14|issue = 2–3|doi = 10.1080/10894160903196558|pmid = 20408014|pages=260–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61268">'''Library science''' (often termed '''library studies''', '''bibliothecography''', '''library economy''')&lt;ref name=note/&gt; is an [[interdisciplinary]] or [[Multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of [[management]], [[information technology]], [[education]], and other areas to [[library|libraries]]; the collection, organization, [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], and [[dissemination]] of information resources; and the [[political economy]] of information. [[Martin Schrettinger]], a Bavarian librarian, coined the discipline within his work (1808–1828) ''Versuch eines vollständigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschäftsführung eines Bibliothekars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz79181.html|title=Deutsche Biographie –  Schrettinger, Martin|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M (2005, June 12). Information schools: a monk, library science, and the information age. Retrieved from http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/huminfo.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The first American school for library science was founded by [[Melvil Dewey]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=oclc/&gt;&lt;ref name=deutsche/&gt;

Historically, library science has also included [[archival science]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of select user groups, how people interact with classification systems and technology, how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the [[ethics]] that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and [[records management]].

There is no generally agreed-upon distinction between the terms ''library science'',and ''librarianship'', and to a certain extent they are interchangeable, perhaps differing most significantly in connotation. The term ''[[library science or library studies]]'' (LIS) is most often used;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq|title= Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions:What is the difference between the MLS, the MILS, the MLIS, etc.?|date=2017 |website=American Library Association |publisher=American Library Association|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; most librarians consider it as only a terminological variation, intended to emphasize the scientific and technical foundations of the subject and its relationship with information science. LIS should not be confused with [[information theory]], the mathematical study of the concept of information. ''Library philosophy'' has been contrasted with ''library science'' as the study of the aims and justifications of librarianship as opposed to the development and refinement of techniques.&lt;ref name=cossette/&gt;

==History==
{{globalize/US|date=November 2016}}

===17th century===
[[File:Gabriel Naude.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of [[Gabriel Naudé]], author of ''Advis pour dresser une bibliothèque'' (1627), later translated into English in 1661]]

The earliest text on library operations, ''Advice on Establishing a Library'' was published in 1627 by French librarian and scholar [[Gabriel Naudé]].
Naudé wrote prolifically, producing works on many subjects including politics, religion, history, and the supernatural. He put into practice all the ideas put forth in ''Advice'' when given the opportunity to build and maintain the library of [[Cardinal Mazarin|Cardinal Jules Mazarin]].

===19th century===
[[File:Dewey relatv index.png|thumbnail]]
[[Martin Schrettinger]] wrote the second textbook (the first in Germany) on the subject from 1808 to 1829.

[[Thomas Jefferson]], whose library at [[Monticello]] consisted of thousands of books, devised a classification system inspired by the [[Baconian method]], which grouped books more or less by subject rather than alphabetically, as it was previously done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emblidge|first=D.|date=2014|title='Bibliomany has possessed me': Thomas Jefferson, the booksellers' customer extraordinaire|url=|journal=The International Journal of the Book |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=17–41 |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jefferson collection provided the start of what became the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The first American school of librarianship opened at [[Columbia University]] under the leadership of [[Melvil Dewey]], noted for his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|1876 decimal classification]], on 5 January 1887 as the School of Library Economy. The term ''library economy'' was common in the U.S. until 1942, with the ''library science'' predominant through much of the 20th century.

===20th century===
Later, the term was used in the title of [[S. R. Ranganathan]]'s ''The Five Laws of Library Science'', published in 1931, and in the title of [[Lee Pierce Butler]]'s 1933 book, ''An introduction to library science'' (University of Chicago Press).

S. R. Ranganathan conceived the [[five laws of library science]] and the development of the first major analytico-synthetic classification system, the [[colon classification]].&lt;ref name=rangan/&gt; In India, he is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field.

In the United States, Lee Pierce Butler's new approach advocated research using [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] and ideas in the [[social sciences]] with the aim of using librarianship to address society's information needs. He was one of the first faculty at the [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]], which changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. This research agenda went against the more procedure-based approach of "library economy," which was mostly confined to practical problems in the administration of libraries.

[[William Stetson Merrill]]'s ''A Code for Classifiers'', released in several editions from 1914 to 1939,&lt;ref name=codef/&gt; is an example of a more pragmatic approach, where arguments stemming from in-depth knowledge about each field of study are employed to recommend a system of classification. While Ranganathan's approach was philosophical it was also tied more to the day-to-day business of running a library. A reworking of Ranganathan's laws was published in 1995 which removes the constant references to books. [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]]'s ''Our Enduring Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century'' features his eight principles necessary by library professionals and incorporate knowledge and information in all their forms, allowing for digital information to be considered.

In more recent years, with the growth of digital technology, the field has been greatly influenced by information science concepts. In the English speaking world the term "library science" seems to have been used for the first time in India&lt;ref&gt;Anwar, Mumtaz A. [http://cybra.p.lodz.pl/Content/1175/vol01no2/anwar_v01n2.html The Pioneers: Asa Don Dickinson]. ''World Libraries''. 1990–1991. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1916 book ''Punjab Library Primer'', written by Asa Don Dickinson and published by the [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Asa D. [https://archive.org/details/punjablibrarypri00dickuoft Punjab Library Primer]. University of Panjab. 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; This university was the first in Asia to begin teaching "library science". The ''Punjab Library Primer'' was the first textbook on library science published in English anywhere in the world. The first textbook in the United States was the ''Manual of Library Economy'', published in 1929. In 1923, [[C. C. Williamson]], who was appointed by the Carnegie Corporation, published an assessment of library science education entitled "The Williamson Report," which designated that universities should provide library science training.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt; This report had a significant impact on library science training and education. Library research and practical work, the area of information science, has remained largely distinct both in training and in research interests.

===21st century===
The digital age has transformed how information is accessed and retrieved. "The library is now a part of a complex and dynamic educational, recreational, and informational infrastructure."&lt;ref name=rubin2/&gt; Mobile devices and applications with wireless networking, high-speed computers and networks, and the computing cloud have deeply impacted and developed information science and information services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Sharon|title=Technology impacts on curriculum of library science (LIS) – a United States (US) perspective|journal=LIBRES: Library &amp; Information Science Research Electronic Journal|date=2013|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–9|url=http://libres.curtin.edu.au/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the library sciences maintains its mission of access equity and community space, as well as the new means for information retrieval called information literacy skills. All catalogues, databases, and a growing number of books are all available on the Internet. In addition, the expanding free access to open source journals and sources such as Wikipedia have fundamentally impacted how information is accessed. [[Information literacy]] is the ability to "determine the extent of information needed, access the needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources critically, incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base, use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally."&lt;ref name=ala/&gt;

== Education and Training ==
{{main|Education for librarianship}}

Academic courses in library science include [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|collection management]], information systems and technology, research methods, [[information literacy]], [[Library catalog|cataloging]] and [[library classification|classification]], [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]], [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|reference]], [[statistics]] and [[management]]. Library science is constantly evolving, incorporating new topics like [[database management system|database management]], [[information architecture]] and [[information management]], among others. With the mounting acceptance of Wikipedia as a valued and reliable reference source, many libraries, museums and archives have introduced the role of [[Wikipedian in residence]]. As a result, some universities are including coursework relating to Wikipedia and Knowledge Management in their MLIS programs.

Most schools in the US only offer a master's degree in library science or an MLIS and do not offer an undergraduate degree in the subject. About fifty schools have this graduate program, and seven are still being ranked. Many have online programs, which makes attending more convenient if the college is not in a student's immediate vicinity. According to ''US News''{{'}} online journal, University of Illinois is at the top of the list of best MLIS programs provided by universities. Second is University of North Carolina and third is University of Washington. All the listings can be found [http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings here.]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News. (2014). Education. Retrieved From: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional library jobs require a professional post-baccalaureate degree in library science, or one of its equivalent terms. In the United States and [[Canada]] the certification usually comes from a master's degree granted by an [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited institution, so even non-scholarly librarians have an originally academic background. In the United Kingdom, however, there have been moves to broaden the entry requirements to professional library posts, such that qualifications in, or experience of, a number of other disciplines have become more acceptable. In Australia, a number of institutions offer degrees accepted by the [[Australian Library and Information Association|ALIA (Australian Library and Information Association)]]. Global standards of accreditation or certification in librarianship have yet to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library Journal]]. (2016). "Librarians need Global Credentials". Retrieved from: http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/04/opinion/backtalk/librarians-need-global-credentials-backtalk&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[academic regalia in the United States]], the color for library science is [[lemon (color)|lemon]].

The Master of Library Science (MLIS) is the master's degree that is required for most professional librarian positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the Master of Library Science (MLS), or Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS) degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), "The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree

==Employment Outlook and Opportunities==
According to 'U.S. News &amp; World Report', library and information science ranked as one of the "Best Careers of 2008."&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt; The median annual salary for 2017 was reported by the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] as $58,520 in the United States.&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; Additional salary breakdowns available by metropolitan area show that the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]-[[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] metropolitan area has the highest average salary at $86,380.&lt;ref name="bls-geographical breakdown"/&gt;  In December 2016, the BLS projected growth for the field at "9 percent between 2016 and 2026", which is "as fast as the average for all occupations".&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; The 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook states, "Workers in this occupation tend to be older than workers in the rest of the economy. As a result, there may be more workers retiring from this occupation than other occupations. However, relatively large numbers of graduates from MLS programs may cause competition in some areas and for some jobs."&lt;ref name="OOH-2010-11"/&gt;

==Gender and library science in the United States==
{{see also|Timeline of women in library science|Timeline of women in library science in the United States}}
Librarianship manifests a dual career structure for men and women in the United States. While the ratio of female to male librarians remains roughly 4:1,&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiebe/&gt; top positions are more often held by men. In large academic libraries, there is less of a discrepancy; however, overall, throughout the profession, men tend to hold higher or leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mestrovic Deyrup|first1=Marta|title=Is the Revolution Over? Gender, Economic and Professional Parity in Academic Library Leadership Positions|journal=College and Research Libraries|date=May 2004|volume=65|pages=242–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, however, have made continuous progress toward equality.&lt;ref name=wiebel/&gt; Women have also been largely left out of standard histories of U.S. librarianship, but Suzanne Hildenbrand's scholarly assessment of the work done by women has expanded the historical record.&lt;ref name=hilden/&gt; See also ''The Role of women in librarianship, 1876–1976: the entry, advancement, and struggle for equalization in one profession'', by Kathleen Weibel, Kathleen de la Peña McCook, and Dianne J. Ellsworth (1979), Phoenix, Ariz: Oryx Press.

=== Gender equality and library leadership ===
There was a "Women's Meeting" at the 1882 14th American Libraries Conference, where issues concerning the salaries of women librarians and what female patrons do in reading rooms were discussed.

During the first 35 years of the [[American Library Association]] its presidency was held by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA's Past Presidents|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/past}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 [[Theresa Elmendorf]] became the first woman elected president of the ALA.&lt;ref name=thomison/&gt; She was ALA president from May 24, 1911, until July 2, 1912.&lt;ref name=ala2/&gt;

In 1919, an ALA resolution promoting equal pay and opportunities for women in librarianship was defeated by a large margin.

In 1970, Betty Wilson brought forth a resolution that would have had the ALA refrain from using facilities that discriminate against women. That resolution was also defeated by the membership.&lt;ref name="WomenArisen"&gt;Schuman, P., &amp; Weibel, K.(1979).The Women Arisen.American Libraries, 10(6), 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the ALA took a stand for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The organization stated that they would no longer hold conferences in states that did not ratify the amendment, with the boycott measure set to take place in 1981.&lt;ref name="LibERA"&gt;Librarians for ERA. (1982). Wilson Library Bulletin, 57289-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenAlabama"&gt;ALA women's rights stand: Alabama warns of impact. (1977). Library Journal, 102(18), 2105.&lt;/ref&gt; An ERA Task Force was formed in 1979 towards this goal and a sum of $25,000 was allocated towards task force operations in unratified states. At the time, a number of state library associations passed pro-ERA resolutions and formed committees on women in libraries.&lt;ref name="LibERA" /&gt;

In 2013–2014, 82% of graduates in Master of Library Science (MLS) programs were female.&lt;ref&gt;http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/library-workers-facts-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2016, [[Carla Hayden]] became the first female [[Librarian of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/14/12916522/carla-hayden-librarian-of-congress |title=Carla Hayden is officially sworn in as the first woman and African-American librarian of Congress |publisher=Vox |date=2016|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional association groups dedicated to librarianship and gender ===
There are multiple groups within the American Library Association, dedicated to discussing, critiquing, and furthering gender-related and feminist issues within the profession.

In 1969 the first women's rights task force was founded: the National Women's Liberation Front for Librarians (NWFFL or New-Waffle). It was also in 1969 that children's librarians, after being unable to find children's books that included working mothers, worked to remedy the situation and succeeded in their efforts.

The American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Round Table Feminist Task Force (FTF) was founded in 1970 by women who wished to address sexism in libraries and librarianship.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; FTF was the first ALA group to focus on women's issues.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; In recent years during Women's History Month (March), the FTF has dedicated their efforts to expanding women’s library history online, using the website Women of Library History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenoflibraryhistory.tumblr.com/ Women of Library History]&lt;/ref&gt; The FTF also publishes the annual Amelia Bloomer Project list,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ameliabloomer.wordpress.com/ Amelia Bloomer Project list]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes some of the best feminist young adult literature of the year.

The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COSWL) of the American Library Association,&lt;ref name=ala3/&gt; founded in 1976, represents the diversity of women's interest within ALA and ensures that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field, and promotes and initiates the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship. The bibliographic history of women in U.S. librarianship and women librarians developing services for women has been well-documented in the series of publications initially issued by the Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on Women and later continued by COSWL.&lt;ref name=mess/&gt;

The ALA also has the Women &amp; Gender Studies Section (WGSS) of its Division "Association of College &amp; Research Libraries"; this section was formed to discuss, promote, and support women's studies collections and services in academic and research libraries.&lt;ref name=libr/&gt;

Finally, the ALA has the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Roundtable (GLBTRT). While the GLBTRT deals with sexuality, different than gender identity, much of the roundtable’s work is arguably feminist in nature, and concerned with issues of gender. The GLBTRT is committed to serving the information needs of the GLBT professional library community, and the GLBT information and access needs of individuals at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA GLBT Roundtable|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/glbtrt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Library science scholarship relating to issues of gender ===

Many scholars within the profession have taken up gender and its relationship to the discipline of library and information science. Scholars like [[Hope A. Olson]] and [[Sanford Berman]] have directed efforts at the problematic nature of [[cataloging]] and classification standards and schemes that are obscuring or exclusionary to marginalized groups. Others have written about the implications of gendered stereotypes in librarianship, particularly as they relate to [[library instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagowski|first1=Nicole|last2=DeFrain|first2=Erica|title=Ice Ice Baby: Are Librarian Stereotypes Freezing Us out of Instruction|url=http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2014/ice-ice-baby-2/|website=In the Library with the Lead Pipe|publisher=In the Library with the Lead Pipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library instruction]] also intersects with [[feminist pedagogy]], and scholars such as Maria Accardi have written about feminist pedagogical practices in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Accardi|first1=Maria|title=Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction|date=July 2013|publisher=Library Juice Press|isbn=978-1-936117-55-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Library scholars have also dealt with issues of gender and leadership, having equitable gender representation in library collection development, and issues of gender and young adult and children’s librarianship.

=== Library policies relating to issues of gender ===
The ALA Policy Manual states under ''B.2.1.15 Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.1.15):'' "The American Library Association stringently and unequivocally maintains that libraries and librarians have an obligation to resist efforts that systematically exclude materials dealing with any subject matter, including sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The Association also encourages librarians to proactively support the First Amendment rights of all library users, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Adopted 1993, amended 2000, 2004, 2008, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala5/&gt; It also states under ''B.2.12 Threats to Library Materials Related to Sex, Gender Identity, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.12)'', "The American Library Association supports the inclusion in library collections of materials that reflect the diversity of our society, including those related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. ALA encourages all American Library Association chapters to take active stands against all legislative or other government attempts to proscribe materials related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression; and encourages all libraries to acquire and make available materials representative of all the people in our society. Adopted 2005, Amended 2009, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala6/&gt;

==Diversity in librarianship==
{{see also|Libraries and the LGBTQ community}}
The field of library science seeks to provide a diverse working environment in libraries across the United States. Ways to change the status quo include diversifying the job field with regards to age, class, disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, race, sex, and sexual orientation. The demographics of America are changing; those who were once minorities will become the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qallaf, C. L. &amp; Mika, J. J. (2013). The Role of Multiculturalism and Diversity in Library and Information science: LIS Education and the Job Market. Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services. 63 (1), p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Library facilities can best represent their communities by hiring diverse staffs.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"&gt;Andrade, R. &amp; Rivera, A. (2011). Developing a Diversity-Competent Workforce: The UA Libraries’ Experience. Journal of Library Administration. 51:7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Library Association and many libraries around the country realize the issue of diversity in the workplace and are addressing this problem.

===Statistics===
The majority of librarians working in the U.S. are female, between the ages of 55–64, and Caucasian.&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;American Library Association. (2014) Diversity Counts. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/offices/diversity/diversitycounts/divcounts&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study by the American Library Association of research done from 2009 to 2010 shows that 98,273 of credentialed librarians were female while 20,393 were male. 15,335 of the total 111,666 were 35 and younger and only 6,222 were 65 or older. 104,393 were white; 6,160 African American, 3,260 American Pacific Islander; 185 Native American including Alaskan; 1,008 of two or more races, and 3,661 Latino. (ALA).&lt;ref name="ala.org"/&gt;

===Strategies===

====Scholarships/grants====
To help change the lack of diversity in library jobs in the U.S., more scholarships and grants are emerging. Most library and information science students do not belong to an [[underrepresented group]] and as a reaction to these research statistics, the field is creating ways to encourage more diversity in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"&gt;Kumasi, K &amp; Hill, R. F. (2011). Are We There Yet? Results of a Gap Analysis to Measure LIS Students’ Prior Knowledge and Actual Learning of Cultural Competence Concepts. Journal of Education for Library &amp; Information Science. 42(4), p.251-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program=====
The ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program is a way to encourage innovation in scholars and professionals to provide insight into how to diversify the field. The ALA Grant is directed toward those who have valuable and original research ideas that can add to the knowledge of diversity in the field of Librarianship. The program awards up to three individuals once a year with a grant of $2,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. (2014). ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicants have submission guidelines, are given a timeline, and are shown the evaluation process online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural competencies====
One way to nurture cultural diversity in the library field is with cultural competencies. Scholars recommend defining skills needed to serve and work with others who belong to different cultures. It is suggested that these definitions be posted in job listings and be referred to when promoting and giving raises.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"/&gt; In library and information science graduate programs, it is also suggested by scholars that there is a lack of classes teaching students cultural competences. It is important for more classes to teach about diversity and measure the outcomes.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"/&gt;

====Recruitment====
Another strategy is to create interest in the field of library and information science from a young age. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. A recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial group's early on in life.&lt;ref&gt;Hanken, T. (2010). Workforce Challenges with the Public Library Sector: Recruitment, Retention and Diversity. PA Times.&lt;/ref&gt; This may inspire more young children to become interested in this field.

===The Deaf Community and Library Science in the United States===
{{unbalanced|date=November 2016}}
Deaf people have the same needs as any other library visitors, and often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for D/deaf and HoH patrons and are working to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible to this group of underserved people.

The history of the role of libraries in the Deaf community in the United States is a sordid one. The [[American Library Association]] readily admits that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and underrepresented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group.&lt;ref name=ala7/&gt; However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made great strides in the mission of making libraries more accessible to disabled people in general and to the Deaf community specifically. The Library Bill of Rights preamble states that "all libraries are forums for information and ideas" and as such libraries need to remove the physical and technological barriers which in turn would allow persons with disabilities full access to the resources available.&lt;ref name=ala8/&gt;

One notable American activist in the library community working toward accessibility for the deaf was [[Alice Lougee Hagemeyer]].&lt;ref name="Hagemeyer"&gt;{{cite https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer/w/page/18570477/Alice%20Hagemeyer |title=historytrendsanddeafeducation / Alice Hagemeyer| |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2017-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deafpeople1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer |title=Deaf Person of the Month |publisher=Deafpeople.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian librarian Karen McQuigg stated in 2003 that "even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively."&lt;ref name=mcquigg/&gt; Clearly, not even so long ago, there was quite a dearth of information for or about the deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.

New guidelines from library organizations such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the deaf community. IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the deaf community.&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local deaf communities. There is now a [http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaourassoc/asclasections/lssps/lspdhhf/lspdhhf Library Service to People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Forum] for libraries to look at to find out what they can do to better serve their Deaf/HoH users.  At the Queen Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.&lt;ref name=hollander/&gt;

==== Deaf libraries ====
The library at [[Gallaudet University]], the only deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials, with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.&lt;ref name=harringt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gallaudet.edu/library&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, deaf culture, and information for family members of deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Theory and practice of library science==
Many practicing librarians do not contribute to LIS scholarship, but focus on daily operations within their own libraries or library systems. Other practicing librarians, particularly in academic libraries, do perform original scholarly LIS research and contribute to the academic end of the field.

Whether or not individual professional librarians contribute to scholarly research and publication, many are involved with and contribute to the advancement of the profession and of library science through local, state, regional, national and international library or information organizations.

Library science is very closely related to issues of [[knowledge organization]]; however, the latter is a broader term which covers how knowledge is represented and stored (computer science/linguistics), how it might be automatically processed (artificial intelligence), and how it is organized outside the library in global systems such as the internet. In addition, library science typically refers to a specific community engaged in managing holdings as they are found in university and government libraries, while knowledge organization in general refers to this and also to other communities (such as publishers) and other systems (such as the Internet). The library system is thus one socio-technical structure for knowledge organization.&lt;ref name=hoetz/&gt;

The terms information organization and knowledge organization are often used synonymously.&lt;ref name = "Bawden and Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|106}}  The fundamentals of their study (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) and many of the main tools used by the disciplines in modern times to provide access to digital resources (abstracting, [[metadata]], resource description, systematic and alphabetic subject description, and terminology) originated in the 19th century and were developed, in part, to assist in making humanity's intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.&lt;ref Name = "Bawden and Robinson" /&gt; {{rp|105}}

Information has been published which analyses the relations between philosophy of information (PI), library and information science (LIS), and social epistemology (SE).&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.4609&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of libraries==

===Public library===
The study of librarianship for [[Public library|public libraries]] covers issues such as cataloging; [[Library collection development|collection development]] for a diverse community; [[information literacy]]; [[readers' advisory]]; community standards; public services-focused librarianship; serving a diverse community of adults, children, and teens; [[intellectual freedom]]; [[censorship]]; and legal and budgeting issues. The public library as a commons or public sphere based on the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]] has become a central metaphor in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=mccook2/&gt;

Most people are familiar with municipal public libraries, but there are many different types of public libraries that exist. There are four different types of public libraries: association libraries, municipal public libraries, school district libraries and special district public libraries. It is very important to be able to distinguish between the four. Each receives its funding through different sources. Each is established by a different set of voters. And, not all are subject to municipal civil service governance. Listed below is a chart from the New York State Library's library development website. This chart lists all of the information about the different public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lis510-libraries.wikispaces.com/Different+types+of+libraries|title=LIS510-Libraries – Different types of libraries|work=wikispaces.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School library/media center===
The study of school librarianship covers library services for children in schools through secondary school. In some regions, the local government may have stricter standards for the education and certification of school librarians (who are often considered a special case of teacher), than for other librarians, and the educational program will include those local criteria. School librarianship may also include issues of [[intellectual freedom]], [[pedagogy]], [[information literacy]], and how to build a cooperative [[curriculum]] with the teaching staff.

The study of academic librarianship covers library services for colleges and universities. Issues of special importance to the field may include [[copyright]]; technology, [[digital libraries]], and digital repositories; [[academic freedom]]; [[open access]] to scholarly works; as well as specialized knowledge of subject areas important to the institution and the relevant [[reference work]]s. Librarians often divide focus individually as liaisons on particular schools within a college or university.

Some academic librarians are considered [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], and hold similar academic ranks to those of professors, while others are not. In either case, the minimal qualification is a Master of Arts in Library Studies or Masters of Arts in Library Science. Some academic libraries may only require a master's degree in a specific academic field or a related field, such as educational technology.

===Archives===
The study of archives includes the training of [[archivist]]s, librarians specially trained to maintain and build [[archive]]s of [[document|records]] intended for [[historic preservation|historical preservation]]. Special issues include physical preservation, conservation and restoration of materials and [[mass deacidification]]; specialist catalogs; solo work; access; and appraisal. Many archivists are also trained historians specializing in the period covered by the archive.

The archival mission includes three major goals: To identify papers and records that have enduring value, to preserve the identified papers, and to make the papers available to others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52540188|title=Developing and maintaining practical archives : a how-to-do-it manual|last=S.|first=Hunter, Gregory|date=2003|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|year=|isbn=1555704670|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=219–223|oclc=52540188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant differences between libraries and archives, including differences in collections, records creation, item acquisition, and preferred behavior in the institution. The major difference in collections is that library collections typically comprise published items (books, magazines, etc.), while archival collections are usually unpublished works (letters, diaries, etc.) In managing their collections, libraries will categorize items individually, but archival items never stand alone. An archival record gains its meaning and importance from its relationship to the entire collection; therefore archival items are usually received by the archive in a group or batch. Library collections are created by many individuals, as each author and illustrator creates their own publication; in contrast, an archive usually collects the records of one person, family, institution, or organization, and so the archival items will have fewer source authors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another difference between a library and an archive, is that library materials are created explicitly by authors or others who are working intentionally. They choose to write and publish a book, for example, and that occurs. Archival materials are not created intentionally. Instead, the items in an archive are what remain after a business, institution, or person conducts their normal business practices.The collection of letters, documents, receipts, ledger books, etc. were created with intention to perform daily tasks, they were not created in order to populate a future archive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As for item acquisition, libraries receive items individually, but archival items will usually become part of the archive's collection as a cohesive group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Behavior in an archive differs from behavior in a library, as well. In most libraries, patrons are allowed and encouraged to browse the stacks, because the books are openly available to the public. Archival items almost never circulate, and someone interested in viewing documents must request them of the archivist and may only view them in a closed reading room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who wish to visit an archive will usually begin with an entrance interview. This is an opportunity for the archivist to register the researcher, confirm their identity, and determine their research needs. This is also the opportune time for the archivist to review reading room rules, which vary but typically include policies on privacy, photocopying, the use of finding aids, and restrictions on food, drinks, and other activities or items that could damage the archival materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Special library===
[[Special library|Special libraries]] and special librarians include almost any other form of librarianship, including those who serve in medical libraries (and hospitals or medical schools), corporations, [[New agency|news agencies]], [[government organizations]], or other [[Research library|special collections]]. The issues at these libraries are specific to the industries they inhabit, but may include solo work, corporate financing, specialized collection development, and extensive self-promotion to potential patrons. Special librarians have their own professional organization, the [[Special Libraries Association|Special Library Association]].

National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ucar.edu/# National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a special library. Its mission is to support, preserve, make accessible, and collaborate in the scholarly research and educational outreach activities of UCAR/NCAR.

Another is the Federal Bureau of Investigations Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/ The FBI Library]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, "The FBI Library supports the FBI in its statutory mission to uphold the law through investigation of violations of federal criminal law; to protect the United States from foreign intelligence and terrorist activities; and to provide leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local, and international agencies.

===Preservation===
{{main|Preservation (library and archival science)}}
Preservation librarians most often work in academic libraries. Their focus is on the management of preservation activities that seek to maintain access to content within books, manuscripts, archival materials, and other library resources. Examples of activities managed by preservation librarians include binding, conservation, digital and analog reformatting, [[digital preservation]], and environmental monitoring.

A '''List of Egyptian [[scribe]]s''', almost exclusively from the '''[[Ancient Egypt]]ian''' periods.

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'', and ''"writings"'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] sign Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of: 'writings, games, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's writing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the colored ink blocks, mostly black and red.&lt;/div&gt;

'''Manuscript culture''' uses [[manuscript]]s to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of [[printing]]. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, [[herbals]], and [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|page=251|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities. Late manuscript culture was characterized by a desire for uniformity, well-ordered and convenient access to the text contained in the manuscript, and ease of reading aloud. This culture grew out of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) and the rise of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It included a change in materials (switching from vellum to paper), and was subject to remediation by the printed book, while also influencing it.

== Medieval manuscript culture ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:مخطوطات عربية قديمة.jpg|thumb|Arabic Manuscripts from the 18th century]]
Manuscript culture seems to have really begun around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–268|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say however, that manuscripts and the recording of information was not important prior to the 10th century, but that during the 10th century, historians see an influx and heavier weight placed on these manuscripts. This was a time when medical practitioners were advancing what they knew about the human body and the way that certain substances interacted with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-48233-2|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These medical practitioners recorded this information and passed it on through the means of literate people. Catholic [[monasteries]] and [[cathedrals]] during the Middle Ages were centers of learning (see [[cathedral schools]]), so it would only make sense for these texts to end up in the hands of the monks.

These monks would meticulously record the information presented in the texts, but not mindlessly. In the case of herbals, for instance, there is evidence that the monks improved upon some texts, retracted textual errors, and made the text particularly relevant to the area in which they lived. Some monasteries even went so far as to grow some of the plants included in the texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–252|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was due in part to their intimate understanding of their local herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Beginnings of Western Science|first=Lindberg|title=David|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because it demonstrated the practical uses of these text in the lives of the monks. They had little room, or patience for that matter, to disseminate the imaginary plants and fanciful texts that are so commonly imagined in the minds of those who think of this era. The writers truly restricted themselves to only include practical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=430–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time when plants and botany was linked very closely with medicine and [[herbal remedies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of bestiaries, similarly to herbals, the monks generally copied and cited previous texts to pass them on. Unlike the herbals, the monks could not grow an animal in their garden, so largely the information taken from the bestiaries was taken at face value. The consequence of this is that the writers were free to elaborate and embellish upon texts. This was a definite and deliberate attempt to give the animal in question a certain moral or allegorical meaning beyond the physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bestiary texts can be very like traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade ===
In the 13th century, [[Paris]] was the first city to have a large commercial trade of manuscripts, with manuscript-book producers being commissioned to make specific books for specific people. Paris had a large enough population of wealthy literate persons to support the livelihood of people producing manuscripts. This medieval era marks the shift in manuscript production from monks in monasteries to booksellers and scribes making a living from their work in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Nicolas, and British Library. ''A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book.'' London: British Library, 1993. p. 45-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flourished initial "L" from a medieval manuscript.jpeg|thumb|left|Flourished initial L&lt;ref&gt;http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/manuscripts/43a.jpeg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Individuals did scribal work, but collaboration has been suggested.  Commercial [[workshops]] or ateliers operated out of Paris during this time, often collaborating on jobs.  Research from François Avril, Joan Diamond and others has confirmed that two or more [[artists]] alternated, or otherwise shared, in the illumination of a single manuscript; however, the detailed logistics of this work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most medieval [[scribes]] gathered together as they copied, but some separated books into sections to copy them in parts.  Previously in the monasteries, work was broken up between scribes and [[Limner|illuminators]]; examples exist where the scribe would leave space for and write out a small cursive letter at the beginning of a new paragraph, which was then painted in at a later time by the illuminator.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel, Christopher. ''The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1988. p. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pecia system ===

The pecia system was developed in [[Italy|Italian]] university cities by the beginning of the thirteenth century and became a regulated procedure at the [[University of Paris]] in the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris'', 1200–1500. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The pecia system broke up the book into sections called peciae.  Individuals — such as students — would rent them, section by section, to copy.  The peciae were generally four folios long which allowed for a fast turn-over rate for each pecia for students to exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L., "La Pecia dans les manuscrits universitaires du XIII  e et du XIV  e siecle." Rev. of La Pecia, by Jean Destrez. ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 33, No. 2. Apr. 1938: pp. 238-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a larger number of copiers, working simultaneously, could produce a copy in a significantly shorter amount of time than a single person working alone.

[[File:c7463-01a.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of pecia mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&amp;IllID=13853|title=Image of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts|first=C|last=Wight|date=|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The original collection of peciae for a book from which all future copies will be based is called the exemplar.  The process of making an exemplar was supposed to be an orderly procedure: Masters of the university who compiled a new work were to edit, correct, and submit this authentic text to a stationer; he in turn copied from it an exemplar in peciae, corrected these against the [[author| author’s]] text with utmost care, and finally submitted them to the inspection of the university’s delegates for approval and for the setting of a rental price. Only then were peciae available for rental and copy.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. ''Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts'', Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17 Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1991. p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it came down to the [[stationer]] — part of whose job was renting out peciae — finding and offering for rental the works which he thought would be demanded. This pressure on the stationers prompted them to acquire exemplars in as good a state and in as short a time as possible. The emphasis was on speed of acquisition instead of the quality of the product. If a certain work seemed likely to become a “best seller,” a stationer would make a copy of the best text immediately available, and would have his exemplar-peciae corrected as well as time permitted. At times, the stationer sought the text; at other times, it was the author who offered his newly completed work to the stationer, but it was never the university as a formal body which made requests or developed what was to be offered.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Booksellers in Paris ===
[[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair of France]], 1285–1314, instituted a .4% commercial [[tax]] on all goods.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1307 the King exempted all the ''librarii universitatis'' from paying the commercial tax, the taille. This exemption privileged the French universities over the booksellers because if they did not swear the oath they would not be exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scriptorium - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|left| Paul Pierce within an illustration of a Mediæval Scriptorium. From a manuscript of a Book of Prayers. 15th Century. British Museum, Slo. 2468.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benham]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16531 ''Old St. Paul's Cathedral'' - Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Librarius'' is a general term while ''stationarius'' refers to one specific kind of librarius. ''Librarius'' can mean anything from scribe to bookseller to [[librarian]]. ''Stationarius'' or stationer refers to those types of ''librarius'' who rented out peciae. Both types, however, were involved in the secondhand trade, produced new books, and were regulated by the university.  The sole distinction between them was the stationer's added service of renting out pecia.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.261-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restrictions ====

The oaths that the ''librarii'' or booksellers had to swear to the [[university|universities]] to obey their regulations and requirements for the tax exemption were extremely restrictive in regard to the resale of secondhand books. They were supposed to act more like intermediaries between the seller and the buyer while their profit was limited to essentially four pence per pound. They were further required to display the secondhand books prominently in their shops, give a professional assessment of the likely price of the books submitted to them, and put would-be buyers in direct contact with the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookseller had to swear not to underpay when buying and not to overcharge when selling. The stationers rented out copies of useful texts, one [[Paper quire|quire]] at a time, so students and masters could make their own copies. Both fees were regulated by the university.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both kinds of booksellers had to guarantee their compliance to their oath by posting a bond of 100 [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:irwin1.jpg|thumb|right|A monk inspecting a sheet of parchment
which he is buying from a parchment-maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hortulus.net/may06lf/irwin.html|title=Hortulus: The Online Graduate Journal of Medieval Studies|author=|date=|website=hortulus.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was not just the booksellers which the universities regulated. Additionally, university regulations forbade parchmenters from hiding the good [[parchment]] from university members wanting to buy. There were plenty of other demands for parchment outside the university such as: the record-keeping for the royal government, every similar entity of a commercial or mercantile [[guild]], every religious house that issued a [[charter]] or kept a rent roll, every public letter-writer, everyone from major international trader to local shop-keeper who kept accounts. They all demanded parchment in greater numbers and were willing to pay higher than the regulated price which the university members paid. And so, the universities feeling such pressures often chose to regulate parchment as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benefits ====

While there were many restrictions on the bookseller, the job did have its benefits. The bookseller was free to produce and sell books, illuminate, or write for anyone they pleased like the Court, cathedral, or the wealthy [[laymen]] of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[provinces]] so long as they met their obligations to the university to which they had sworn oaths. In fact, most of their trade fell outside of the university regulation. There is an important distinction between the regulation of how books were traded within the university and how the booksellers were able to charge whatever the open market would bear. To the non-student or masters, there were no such restrictions on the booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.269.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1300–1500, the position of libraire was a closed position only open upon the resignation or death of a previous one. Aside from cheap books, it was only the libraire who was allowed to sell books in Paris. The university essentially guaranteed a monopoly on the sale of books for booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late Manuscript Culture ==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]
The period of "Late Manuscript Culture" dates from roughly the mid-fourteenth century to the fifteenth century, preceding and existing alongside the printing press.  While embodying all of the ideals and adhering to the regulations observable in the [[Devotio Moderna]], there are many clear characteristics of Late Manuscript Culture.  For instance, careful attention was paid to the punctuation and layout of texts, with readability and specifically reading aloud taking preeminence. Meaning had to be clear in every sentence, with as little room left to interpretation as possible (compared to the lack of spaces in text and any markings for the purpose of aiding in enunciation), due to preachings' rise in popularity after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].  Correct [[orthography]] was attempted whenever the necessary exemplars made it possible to emend earlier texts, especially Bibles, and this correction made many texts uniform.  In this period of Manuscript Culture, the emendatiora, manuscripts which combined surviving texts of the oldest available exemplars with the manuscripts that had been currently acceptable and prominent, were created.&lt;ref&gt;
Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts, Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17, p. 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aids to find one's way about the text are prominent features in these manuscripts.  While none were invented solely in fifteenth century, they were used with increasing frequency and became more complex. These include:

* tables of contents
* lists of chapters, either at the beginning of each book or gathered at the beginning of the whole work (if it is a collection of works)
* running headlines
* extensively detailed [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]]
* page numbers in [[Arabic numerals]].
* the appearance of subject indexes&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte.  The Codex in the Fifteenth Century. Manuscript and Print. Barker, Nicolas, ed. and British Library. A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book. London: British Library, 1993. p. 63-84. Rouse, 1991. p. 452-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other changes included the enlargement of the [[rubric]] from one to two lines in the university manuscript to eight or ten, and the distinction of it by separate letter-form.  The rubric also changed in regard to the categories of information included in it. An earlier rubric might have contained a title of the particular section or article, and a description of the ending of the preceding one.  A fifteenth century rubric would add information about the translator or translators, and the original writer if they were not particularly well known. A brief description of their content, or even detailed information considering the date or conditions of the works creation is also occasionally seen, though not as frequently. These changes exemplify the desire for uniformity, ease of access, and strict regulation of a given work and its subsequent correction.  These are many of the same goals attributed to the uniformity exemplified by the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 452-457&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production of manuscripts at the beginning of the fifteenth century ===

The emergence of new standards in manuscript production, beginning in the [[Low Countries]] at the end of the fourteenth century, clearly marked the beginning of a new epoch in manuscript culture. Uniformity would result from the desire for clarity, both in terms of bibliographic accuracy and the reproduction and correction of the text itself.  It necessitated greater organization, specifically within the monastic [[scriptoria]].  These had lost pre-eminence in medieval manuscript culture, characterized by the university, but had begun to undergo a rebirth in the fourteenth century.  Historians have characterized this period as chaotic, with very poor quality paper manuscripts being held as a standard.  However, the varying quality of materials did not affect the quality of the text contained on it, as the transition was made from parchment to rag paper. For instance, there was the formation of a new script, called hybrida, that sought to combine the traditional cursiva script with the script used in printed books.  There was little loss of legibility, due to the use of sharp angles instead of loops.  Additionally, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the practice of using a hierarchy of scripts to demarcate different sections of a text was re-instituted.  Rubrics and colophons were clearly set off from the remainder of a text, employing their own unique script.  All of these changes resulted from a desire for improved accuracy, and led to the creation of complex codification rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 450-452&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniformity amidst variety ===

Many manuscripts were produced that had differences in terms of size, layout, script, and illumination.  They were based on the same text while being created by many different scribes.  Yet, they were meticulously corrected, to the point that very few differences in terms of the text itself can be observed among them.  This implied not only the presence of a direct authority that maintained some sort of direction over the scribes, but also a newfound pursuit of scholarly accuracy that had not been present with the university book sellers. It was emphasized by the new religious orders that had been created in the fourteenth century.  Correction and emendation would be held in the same esteem as copying itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-440&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codification rules and the Opus Pacis ===

Written in 1428 by the German [[Carthusian]], Oswald de Corda, prior of the Grand Chartreuse, the Opus Pacis consisted of two parts.  One dealt primarily with orthography and accent, where Oswald stated that his motive in creating these codification rules was to dispel the anxiety of his fellow [[Carthusians]].  Many members of the order were worried about the omission of single letters, not just phrases, words or syllables within copies of a given text (demonstrating the new concern for uniformity taken to an extreme).  It is clear that his audience was composed of [[scribes]], specifically those meticulous to “the verge of neurosis”.  He seeks to reinforce the importance of older statutes regarding manuscript production, such as the Carthusian statutes, and the way in which he seeks to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, 450-457&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Statuta Nova of 1368 ====

Oswald specifically wanted to reform the Statuta Nova of 1368. It stated no one could emend copies of the Old and New Testament, unless they were doing so against exemplars that had been prescribed by their order.  Anyone who corrected texts in a manner inconsistent with those exemplars was publicly acknowledged to have corrupted the text, and subsequently punished.  Oswald answered this with his Work of Peace, and stated that correctors should not engage in pointless labor by over-correcting.  In it, he described correction not as a command, but an indulgence. It was practiced for the improvement and glorification of a text, and though it followed a set of rules, they were not so strict as to stifle emendation.  This was a transition from older works with large amounts of lists and regulations that mandated every action a scribe could take in correction, and had been widely ignored in medieval print culture.  Oswald rejected a system in which one must simply pick a single exemplar and correct according to it, or reproduce portions of texts which the scribe knew to be in error due to a proper exemplar not being attainable. Before Oswald, many believed these were the only available options under the older, strict rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New rules of corrections ====

Oswald specifically made sure to outline the proper way of correcting various readings of the same text, as observed in varying exemplars.  He stated that scribes shouldn't instantly correct according to one or the other, but deliberate, and use proper judgment.  Oswald also said that in the case of bibles, scribes should not immediately modernize archaic spellings, because this had produced further variation within texts. Oswald also detailed a uniform set of abbreviations. However, he stated that scribes should recognize national differences, particularly in light of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].  Scribes were right to correct texts with different dialects of [[Latin]], especially if they were using archaic forms of Latin verbs, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hist.msu.ru/Departments/Medieval/Cappelli/ Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Valde Bonum ====

In his prologue to the Opus Pacis, Oswald contrasts his work with the Valde Bonum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 A 14th/15th century, German Valde Bonum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213323/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier handbook compiled during the Great Schism.  It had attempted to set forth universal spellings for the [[Bible]], and stated that the corrector need not emend to conform to an exemplar from a given region based on its perceived superiority, but could rather take local regional practice as a standard.  It acknowledged that centuries of use, and transmission from nation to nation, had an effect on various spellings.  He incorporated many of these elements into his Opus Pacis, which was copied and put to practical use, and had spread from [[Germany]] as far north as [[Ireland]].  By the 1480s, it had become a standard, specifically for the Devotio Moderna and the Reformed [[Benedictines]]. Opus Pacis became a generic term for any work of its kind.  The last surviving copy was written in 1514, indicating that manuscript correction remained an important subject sixty years into the printed era.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript as a vehicle for preaching ===

It was in Late Manuscript Culture that the written page took on a renewed meaning to religious communities.  Scriptorias of Benedictine, Cisterican and Augustinaian houses had resumed after being suppressed by the production of university and mendicant books.  Particularly, these scriptoria exemplified the idea that one shall live by the fruit of one's labors.  Writing sacred books was the most fitting, suitable and pious task that one could undertake to do so.  Also, copying these books was equivalent to preaching with ones hands.  Sermons were only of moderate importance in the 13th century. By the 15th century, after the emphasis placed on preaching in the Fourth Lateran Council, they were of the utmost importance.  The formation and expansion of preaching orders led to the proliferation of pastoral theology in schools, and preaching was now an indispensable part of the sacraments.  Uniform manuscripts with many tools made for ease of reference, reading, and enunciation became necessary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 452-456&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devotio Moderna and the reformed Benedictines relied on reading devotional texts for instruction, and the written word was raised to a high level of importance not afforded by earlier religious movements.   The writing was just as important as the word.  In fact, monasteries bought many printed books, becoming the main market for the early printing press, precisely because of this devotion to preaching.  Without the Devotio Moderna and orders that followed their example, the need for texts and printers would not have been present. Printing had exploded in [[Germany]] and the Low Countries, the home of the Devotio Moderna and Reformed Benedictines, as opposed to [[England]] and [[France]]. They were also the home to the beginnings of Late Manuscript Culture, because of the common desire for uniformity. Trimethius protested the invasion of the [[library]] by the printed book because of the missing aspect of devotion that had been present in preaching with ones' hands.  With the preaching possible as a scribe, manuscripts had a function that was lacking in a printed book, though both possessed a greater degree of uniformity than earlier manuscripts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Manuscripts and the arrival of print ===

By roughly 1470, the transition from [[Penmanship|handwritten]] books to printed ones had begun.  The book trade, in particular, underwent drastic changes.  By this point German printing presses had reached the northernmost regions of [[Europe]], specifically Paris.  By 1500, print had stopped imitating manuscripts and manuscripts were imitating print.  In the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–1547) for instance, the king's handwritten manuscripts were based on Roman type.  While quality rag paper had appeared before the arrival of the printing press, it was at this time that parchmenters lost most of their business.  Paper was not only acceptable, it was preferable, and printers and scribes had both ceased to use parchment altogether.  Many libraries decried these changes, because of the loss in individuality and subtlety that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 63–81 Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris, 1200–1500''. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; Many printed books and manuscripts were even created with the same paper.  The same watermarks are often observable on them, that signified the particular paper dealer who created it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php wzma.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611161722/http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts were still written and illuminated well into the sixteenth century, some dating to just before 1600.  Many illuminators continued to work on various manuscripts, specifically the [[Book of Hours]].  The Book of Hours had been the most commonly produced manuscript from the 1450s onward, and was among the last manuscripts created.  By the sixteenth century, however, manuscripts were mostly illuminated by artists retained by nobles or royals.  Their work was required (and manuscripts were created) only for unusual occasions, such as noble or royal births, weddings, or other extraordinary occurrences.  The number of copyists had greatly declined, as these types of manuscripts were not intended for mass, or even student, consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-79'' Rouse 2000, p. 329-331&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional organization of book production fell apart; they were made up of libraries doling out quires to scribes and illuminators, who lived in proximity.  The new, specialized system based on patronage didn't support them.  Libraries, and not scribes, turned into printers, and served as a link between late manuscript culture and print culture.  They had possessed reserves of manuscripts, and slowly supplemented them with printed books, until printed books dominated their collections. However, the cost and risks involved in making books greatly increased with the transition to print. Still, Paris and more northern areas of Europe (especially France) had been the foremost center of manuscript production, and remained a force in the printed book market, falling only behind Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-72 Rouse 2000, p. 329–332&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manuscript descent and exemplars ====

There were accounts{{By whom|date=February 2011}} of scribes working in a similar manner in comparison to their rival printers, though the process was still subtly different.  The pages on sheets of vellum were folded together to form a quire before the invention of printing or paper, and printed books also bound multiple quires to form a codex. They were simply made of paper.  Manuscripts were also used as exemplars for printed books. Lines were counted off based on the exemplar and marked in advance, while the typesetting reflected the layout of the manuscript's text.  Within a few generations, however, printed books were used as new exemplars. This process created various “family trees”, as many printed sources would be double checked against earlier manuscripts if the quality was deemed too low.  This necessitated the creation of stemma, or lines of descent among books. This made manuscripts gain a new significance, as sources to find earlier authority or a better authority, in comparison to the published version of a text.  [[Erasmus]], for instance, attained authoritative manuscripts from the medieval period due to his dissatisfaction with printed Bibles.

=== Christine de Pizan and humanist illumination ===

The Epistre Othea or Letter of Othea to Hector,  composed in 1400, symbolized the murky transition from manuscript culture to the Renaissance and humanistic print culture.  It was a retelling of the classical story of Othea through an illuminated manuscript, though it conveyed many humanistic Renaissance ideas.  Created by [[Christine de Pizan]], its patron was Louis of Orleans, heir to the French throne.  It contained over 100 images, and each chapter opened with the image of a mythological figure or event.  It also contained short narrative verses, and text addressed to Hector.  Each prose passage contained a labeled gloss, and attempted to interpret a humanistic lesson from the myth.  Every gloss closed with a quote from an ancient philosopher.  Additionally, other short prose passages called allegories concluded a section. They conveyed lessons applicable to the soul, and a Latin Bible quotation.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, Marilynn and Pamela Sheingorn. Myth, montage, &amp; visuality in late medieval manuscript culture : Christine de Pizan’s Epistre Othea. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2003. p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine de Pizan combined contemporary images through illumination with new humanistic values typically associated with print.  Her work was based on [[Ovid]]'s, and many Ovidian myths were traditionally illuminated, in the medieval period.  She also incorporated astrology, Latin texts, and a wide variety of classical mythology in fleshing out Ovid's account, maintaining her humanist motivations.  This contradiction also led to the use of illuminatio, or the practice of using light as color.  Her Othea is a [[bricolage]], restructuring tradition while not trying to create a new master work.  It was done in the style of an ordinatio, or layout that emphasized the meaning of the organization of images.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p.1-192&lt;/ref&gt;

The Othea reflected a late manuscript culture that was defined by violence, action, and gender challenges within literature. Anger was depicted in relation to gender, and marked “a departure from the Aristotelian tradition”.   Women were no longer driven into mindless frenzies, but possessed anger that developed from fully considered character interactions.  The Epistre Othea remained Christine's most popular work, despite the fact that multiple versions existed.  Because of the fluid nature of manuscript reproduction, specifically in the case of illumination (as opposed to the text), the visual experience was not uniform. Each exemplar incorporated diverse cultural elements, with many having entirely different philosophical and theological implications.  Only later reproductions that used woodcuts to reproduce the images created a truly authorial version of the manuscript.  It also owed its  very existence to the printing press in the first instance, because bibles were now relegated to the press, leaving nonreligious texts available for detailed illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p. 192-241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructing an Auctor with Chaucer ===

====William Caxton====
While using medieval manuscripts as exemplars, many printers attempted to implant humanist values into the text. They attempted to create a uniform work, displaying many similarities in terms of motivation with the Devotio Moderna.  Early editors and publishers needed definitive works to define a culture.  [[William Caxton]] (1415~1424-1492), an editor, was instrumental in shaping English culture and language, and did so through his authoritative Works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 A 14th/15th century, Caxton era Works of Chaucer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213202/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caxton was a transitional figure, who sought to close the gap between manuscript culture and a more humanistic print culture through Chaucer's work.  Specifically, Caxton attempted to make Chaucer appear similar to classical writers and continental poets.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Lauryn S.. Words made flesh: reading medieval manuscript culture. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. p. 121-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chaucer as humanist ====

Caxton attempted to make Chaucer into an English [[Petrarch]] or [[Virgil]], and realized that new humanistic sixteenth century versions of his work had to recognize fourteenth century versions.  His Chaucer transcended medieval ideals, and became timeless, conforming to humanistic ideals.  This required construction of a literary genealogy referred to older medieval exemplars.  Through his editing, Chaucer was framed as an early promoter of the Renaissance, who decried Gothic and medieval culture, and who rescued the English language.

{{Rquote|left|he by hys labour enbelysshyd/ornated and made faire our englisshe/in thys Royame was had rude speche &amp; Incongrue/as yet it appiereth by olde bookes/whych at thys day ought not to haue place ne be compared emong ne to hys beauteuous volumes/and aournate writynges|Mayer, p. 123 |William Caxton}}

&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 121-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caxton and the flaws of "Olde Bookes" ====

Caxton wanted to discard “old bookes” that were characteristic of medieval culture.  To do this, he modernized older terms and introduced Latinate spellings.  He removed the influence of manuscript culture, that allowed the reader to have some textual authority.  Caxton believed that printed books could set a defined authorship, in which the reader would not feel it appropriate to change the text or add glosses.  He believed that cheap versions of this authorial Chaucer would allow a diverse group of readers to develop common economic and political ideals, unifying the culture of England.  He was the exemplum for the English standard.  His version of Chaucer was well liked by [[Henry VII of England]], who decided to spread it in order to help provide England with a common cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 132-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changing perceptions of the book ====

To most people in the late age of manuscript culture,  books were codices first, vehicles for text, regardless of whether they were printed or handwritten.  The cost of obtaining them determined the standard, and printed books gradually gained precedence.  William Caxton stated that his readers could have them “good cheap”, and that the quality of text was improved, if not equaled, in print. Many catalogues from the period do list both kinds indiscriminately.  However, in auctions a careful distinction was made between the two, as anything handwritten fetched a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 64-84&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular assumptions and historical revision ===

Many scholars of [[print culture]], as well as [[classicists]], have argued that inconsistencies existed among manuscripts due to the blind copying of texts and a static manuscript culture that (specifically medieval manuscript culture) existed during the rise of the printing press.  They have stated that once a mistake was made, it would be repeated endlessly and compounded with further mistakes by refusing to deviate from the previous exemplar, thus exposing an obvious advantage of print. The noted classicist E.J. Kenney, whose work formed much of the early scholarship on this issue, stated that  “medieval authors, scribes, and readers had no notion of emending a text, when they were confronted with an obvious error in their exemplars, other than by slavishly copying the readings of another text”. There was a great diversity among them in terms of changes in style and a willingness to deviate from prior exemplars, however, as observed in [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/th/c/1500/03101061.jpg this] copy of [[Jerome]]'s Epistolae Morale, compared to  [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/class/c/1500/00700908.jpg this] copy of [[Cicero]]'s Letters, both dating from the 16th century.  Many historians and specifically medievalists argue that the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries demonstrated reforms that accommodated many of the functions associated with print. Also, many classicists naturally looked to reproductions of classical texts during the period, which were not necessarily characteristic of other work that was deemed more important. Universality and uniformity, medievalists believe, was seen among some late manuscripts, along with other changes typically associated with the printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-429&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the recent scholarship on Late Manuscript Culture was specifically generated by [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;
Elizabeth Eisenstein, Print as an Agent of Change, 2 vols. (Cambridge: University Press, 1979). p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; a key print culture scholar, and arguably creator of the "print culture" model.  Eisenstein  argued that the invention of the printing press eventually led to the Renaissance, and the social conditions necessary for its occurrence.  The printing press allowed readers to free themselves from many limitations of the manuscript.  She did not detail the state of manuscript and scribal culture in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however.  She described in depth the conditions present in Germany at the time of the printing presses' invention in [[Mainz]], and detailed the scribal culture in England and France in order to compare print culture and manuscript culture. She didn't describe Italian humanists in [[Florence]] and renewed religious orders of the Modern Devotion in the Low Countries and Germany.  These included the [[Windesheim Congregation]], of which Oswald de Corda was a member.  Many medievalists, specifically Mary A. Rouse and Richard H. Rouse,  responded by attempting to  create a more detailed account of late manuscript culture, and defined its distinctive characteristics. This is part of the belief that changes occurred during the period that print culture scholars, such as Eisenstein, ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 465-466&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern architecture''', or '''modernist architecture''' was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction, particularly the use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[reinforced concrete]];  the idea that form should follow function; an embrace of [[minimalism]]; and a rejection of ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/modernism|title=What is Modern architecture?|language=English|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after [[World War II]] until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the  
principal style for institutional and corporate buildings  by [[Postmodern architecture]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=6-10}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering and building materials,  and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and to invent something that was purely functional and new.

The revolution in materials came first, with the use of [[cast iron]], [[plate glass]], and [[reinforced concrete]], to build structures that were stronger, lighter and taller.  The [[cast plate glass]] process was invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. [[The Crystal Palace]] by [[Joseph Paxton]] at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story [[Home Insurance Building]] in [[Chicago]], built in 1884 by [[William Le Baron Jenney]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=42-43}}  The iron frame construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]], then the tallest structure in the world, captured the imagination of millions of visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Universal Exposition]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=14-16}}

French industrialist [[François Coignet]] was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete strengthened with iron bars,  as a technique for constructing buildings.&lt;ref name="britannia"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124672/Francois-Coignet Encyclopædia Britannica - François Coignet]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-story house in the suburbs of Paris.&lt;ref name="britannia"/&gt; A further important step forward was the invention of the safety [[elevator]] by [[Elisha Otis]], first demonstrated at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1852, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=42}}    Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=16}}

The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century,  most notably [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticism]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture]], and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000.

In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur L'Architecture'',  he urged: "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material;  for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet Le-duc, ''Entretiens sur Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

At the end of the 19th century, a few architects began to challenge the traditional [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States.  The [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1896-99) designed by [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]], had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=27}} The [[Art Nouveau]] style was launched in the 1890s by [[Victor Horta]] in Belgium and [[Hector Guimard]] in France; it introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms.  In Barcelona, [[Antonio Gaudi]] conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; the facade of the [[Casa Battlo]] in [[Barcelona]] (1904–1907) had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=33}}

Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques, which gave them greater freedom to create new forms. In 1903–1904 in Paris [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] began to use [[reinforced concrete]], previously only used for industrial structures, to build apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Poisson|pages=318-319}}  Reinforced concrete, which could be molded into any shape, and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars, replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects. The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles, but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris; here the concrete was left bare, and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows. [[Henri Sauvage]] added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris (1912–1914); the reinforced concrete building was in steps, with each floor set back from the floor below, creating a series of terraces.  Between 1910 and 1913, Auguste Perret built the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction, with Art Deco sculptural bas-reliefs on the facade by [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. Because of the concrete construction, no columns blocked the spectator's view of the stage.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|page=318}}

[[Otto Wagner]], in Vienna, was another pioneer of the new style. In his book ''Moderne Architektur'' (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on "modern life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0226869393 Otto Wagner, ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to this Field of Art''], 1895, translation by Harry Francis Mallgrave, Getty Publications, 1988, {{ISBN|0226869393}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at [[Karlsplatz]] in Vienna (1888–89), then an ornamental [[Art Nouveau]] residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the [[Austrian Postal Savings Bank]] (1904–1906).  Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior.  The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare,  a large open space of steel, glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself.{{Sfn|Bony|page=36}}

The Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]] also began removing any ornament from his buildings.  His [[Steiner House]], in Vienna (1910), was an example of what he called [[rationalist architecture]]; it had a simple stucco rectangular facade with square windows and no ornament. . The fame of the new movement, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]] spread beyond Austria. [[Josef Hoffmann]], a student of Wagner, constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture, the [[Palais Stoclet]], in Brussels, in 1906–1911. This residence, built of brick covered with Norwegian marble, was composed of geometric blocks, wings and a tower.  A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms. The interior was decorated with paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]] and other artists, and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=38}}

In Germany, a modernist industrial movement, [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) had been created in Munich in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]], a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists,  to turn out well-designed, high quality products, and in the process to invent a new type of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Burckhardt (1987) . ''The Werkbund''. ? : Hyperion Press. ISBN. Frederic J. Schwartz (1996). ''The Werkbund: Design Theory and Mass Culture Before the First World War''. New Haven, Conn. : Yale University Press. ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include [[Peter Behrens]], [[Theodor Fischer]] (who served as its first president), [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Richard Riemerschmid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. "Joseph August Lux: Werkbund Promoter, Historian of a Lost Modernity," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' 63/1 (June 2004): 202&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911–1913, [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, a building without ornament where every construction element was on display. The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  For the 1914 Cologne exhibition, [[Bruno Taut]] built a revolutionary glass pavilion.{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=19}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a highly original and independent American architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement.  Like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], he had no formal architectural training. In 1887-93 he worked in the Chicago office of [[Louis Sullivan]], who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in Chicago, and who famously stated "form follows function." {{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=16}}  Wright set out to break all the traditional rules. Wright was particularly famous for his [[Prairie Houses]],  including the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]](1893–94),;[[Arthur Heurtley House]] (1902) and [[Robie House]] (1909); sprawling, geometric residences without decoration, with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth, and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the American prairie.  His [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Building]] (1904–1906) in [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Unity Temple]] (1905) in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] and [[Unity Temple]] had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=62-63}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, the first [[skyscrapers]] began to appear in the United States.  They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety [[elevator]] invented by [[Elisha Otis]] in 1852. The first steel-framed "skyscraper", The [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]] in 1883, and was briefly the tallest building in the world. [[Louis Sullivan]] built another monumental new structure, the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]], in the heart of Chicago in 1904-06. While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from neo-renaissance, [[Neo-Gothic]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  The [[Woolworth Building]], designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the [[Chrysler Building]] in 1929.  The structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with [[Neo-Gothic]] ornament, complete with decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it be nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce."   {{Sfn|Burchard and Brown|1966|page=83}}

==Rise of Modernism in Europe and Russia (1918–1931)==
After the first World War, a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of [[neo-classicism]] and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, and the modernists, led by [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in France, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] in Germany, and [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the new [[Soviet Union]], who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration. [[Art Deco]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] often made a compromise between the two, combining modernist forms and stylized decoration.

The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, a Swiss-French architect who in 1920 took the name [[Le Corbusier]].  In 1920 he co-founded a journal called '''L'Espirit Nouveau'' and energetically promoted architecture that was functional, pure, and free of any decoration or historical associations.  He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism, based on planned cities.  In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people, whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland. He designed modular houses, which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks, neighborhoods and cities. In 1923 he published "Toward an Architecture", with his famous slogan, "a house is a machine for living in."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture", (1923), Flammarion edition (1995), pages XVIII-XIX&lt;/ref&gt;  He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans, articles, books, conferences, and participation in Expositions.

To illustrate his ideas, in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris.  They were all built according to a common system,  based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans, independent of the structure.  They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the [[Villa Savoye]], built in 1928–1931 in the Paris suburb of [[Poissy]].  An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Germany, two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War,   The [[Bauhaus]] was a school organized [[Weimar]] in 1919 under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]].  Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin, who studied before the war with [[Peter Behrens]], and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory.  The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology.  In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau;  Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new, purely functional modernist style he was encouraging.  The school brought together modernists in all fields;  the faculty included the modernist painters [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Josef Albers|Joseph Albers]] and [[Paul Klee]], and the designer [[Marcel Breuer]].

Gropius became an important theorist of modernism, writing ‘’The Idea and Construction’’ in 1923.  He was an advocate of standardization in architecture, and the mass construction of rationally-designed apartment blocks for factory workers.  In 1928 he was commissioned by the [[Siemens]] company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin,  and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers.

While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin.  Inspired by the [[De Stijl]] movement in the Netherlands, he built clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower.  He became the vice president of the German ‘’Werkbund’’, and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1932.  proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction.  His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona. It was a work of pure modernism, with glass and concrete walls and clean, horizontal lines.  Though it was only a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930, it became, along with Le Corbusier's [[Villa Savoye]], one of best-known landmarks of modernist architecture.  A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists, and closed the school in 1932.  Gropius left Germany and went to England, then to the United States, where he and [[Marcel Breuer]] both joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects. In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United States; he became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Expressionism]], which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925, was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund.  Its advocates, including [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Fritz Hoger]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]], wanted to create architecture that was poetic, expressive, and optimistic. Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid–1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;   As result, many of the most innovative expressionist projects, including [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels'', remained on paper. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. A particular type, using bricks to create its forms (rather than concrete) is known as [[Brick Expressionism]].

[[Erich Mendelsohn]],  (who disliked the term Expressionism for his work) began his career designing churches, silos, and factories which were highly imaginative, but, for lack of resources, were never built In 1920, he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam;  an observatory and research center called the [[Einsteinium]], named in tribute to [[Albert Einstein]].  It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete, but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster. His sculptural form, very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus, first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Berlin. His [[Mossehaus]] in Berlin was an early model for the [[streamline moderne]] style.  His [[Columbushaus]] on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin (1931) was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed. (It was torn down in 1957, because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin, where the [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed.)  Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he moved to England (1933), then to the United States (1941).{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=95}}

[[Fritz Höger]] was another notable Expressionist architect of the period.  His [[Chilehaus]] was built as the headquarters of a shipping company, and was modeled after a giant steamship, a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow. It was constructed of dark brick, and used external piers to express its vertical structure. Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals, as did its internal arcades. [[Hans Poelzig]] was another notable expressionist architect.  In 1919 he built the ''[[Großes Schauspielhaus]]'', an immense theater in Berlin, seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario [[Max Reinhardt]].  It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome, and lights on massive columns in its foyer. He also constructed the [[IG Farben building]], a massive corporate headquarters, now the main building of [[Goethe University]] in Frankfurt. [[Bruno Taut]] specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for working-class Berliners.  He built twelve thousand individual units, sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes, such as a giant horseshoe.  Unlike most other modernists, he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name, [[Brick Expressionism]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=26-27}}

The Austrian philosopher, architect and social critic [[Rudolf Steiner]] also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms. His [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], built from 1926 near [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] the [[Einsteinturm]] in Potsdam, Germany, and the [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1926), were based on no traditional models, and had entirely original shapes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the [[Russian Revolution]]  of 1917, Russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism.  The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period, the [[futurism]] of poet [[Vladimir Mayakovskiy]], the [[Suprematism]] of painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], and the colorful [[Rayonism]] of painter [[Mikhail Larionov]]. The most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor [[Vladimir Tatlin]] for the Moscow meeting of the Third [[Communist International]] in 1920:  he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high, with four geometric volumes suspended from cables.  The movement of Russian [[Constructivist architecture]] was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by [[Aleksandr Rodchenko]].  Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the "communist expression of material structures." Soviet architects began to construct workers' clubs, communal apartment houses, and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=86-87}}

One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was [[Konstantin Melnikov]], the number of working clubs - including [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1928) - and his own living house, [[Melnikov House]] (1929) near [[Arbat Street]] in [[Moscow]].  Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris in 1925;  it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway, and crowned with a hammer and sickle.  The leading group of constructivist architects, led by [[Vesnin brothers]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], was publishing the 'Contemporary Architecture' journal. This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan - including colossal [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1932) - and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburg's [[Narkomfin building]]. A number of architects from the pre-Soviet period also took up the constructivist style.  The most famous example was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow (1924), by [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alexey Shchusev (1873-1949)|url = http://www.architectural-review.com/view/reviews/reputations/alexey-shchusev-1873-1949/8660736.article|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad; however, during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities. The regional industrial centers, including [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinburg]], [[Kharkiv]] or [[Ivanovo]], were rebuilt in the constructivist manner; some cities, like [[Magnitogorsk]] or [[Zaporizhia]], were constructed anew (the so-called ''socgorod'', or 'socialist city').

The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s, replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored. Constructivist architects and even [[Le Corbusier]] projects for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] from 1931 to 1933, but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed [[Postconstructivism]].  The last major Russian constructivist building, by [[Boris Iofan]], was built for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Exhibition]] (1937), where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitler's architect [[Albert Speer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facing Hitler's Pavilion: The Uses of Modernity in the Soviet Pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition|url = http://jch.sagepub.com/content/47/1/13|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0022-0094|pages = 13–47|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022009411422369|first = Danilo|last = Udovički-Selb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism becomes a movement: CIAM (1928)===
{{main article|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne}}
By the late 1920s, modernism had become an important movement in Europe.  Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international.  The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]], had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]] in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]].  Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland June 26–28, 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Lluís Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland.  No one attended from the United States.  A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city",  was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84-85}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Art Deco]] architectural style (called ''Style Moderne'' in [[France]]),  was modern, but it was not modernist;  it had many features of modernism,  including the use of reinforced concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[Neo-classicism]];  but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color.  It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe;  in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia and Japan.  In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries.  Only two pavilions were purely modernist;  the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in a flamboyantly [[futurist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Anwas, Victor, ''Art Deco'' (1992), Harry N. Abrams Inc., {{ISBN|0810919265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the [[Grand Rex]] movie theater in Paris, [[La Samaritaine]] department store by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1926–28) and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris (1937–38) by [[Auguste Perret]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] and [[Palais de Chaillot]], both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Poisson, Michel, ''1000 Immeubles et Monuments de Paris'' (2009), Parigramme, pages 318-319 and 300-01&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the [[Chrysler Building]], [[Empire State Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, and [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit.  The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at the top of the Chrysler building, Art Deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce", were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns,  and European cathedrals, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] himself experimented with [[Mayan Revival architecture|Mayan Revival]], in the concrete cube-based [[Ennis House]] of 1924 in Los Angeles. The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities.  The style was used most often in office buildings, but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced.{{Sfn|Duncan}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The beginning of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 brought an end to lavishly-decorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers. It also brought in a new style, called "Streamline Moderne" or sometimes just Streamline.  This style, sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners, featured rounded corners,  strong horizontal lines, and often nautical features, such as superstructures and steel railings. It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation;  the style was often used for new airport terminals, train and bus stations, and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system.  In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings, but in railroad locomotives, and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.  It both borrowed from [[industrial design]] and influenced it.&lt;!--Raymond Loewy; locomotives, aircraft, and ships, automobiles--&gt;&lt;!--cosmetic functionality--&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|2014|page=204}}

In the United States, the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings, sometimes called [[PWA Moderne]], for the [[Public Works Administration]], which launched gigantic construction programs in the U.S. to stimulate employment.  It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament, and was employed in state and federal buildings, from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] (1941–43), begun just before the United States entered the Second World War.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|accessdate=March 2011|page=27|origyear=2003|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Frank Lloyd Wright|Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Richard Neutra}}
During the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements. He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own. Between 1916 and 1922, he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement; this became known as his "Mayan style", after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization. He experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing. He identified his architecture as "Usonian", a combination of USA, "utopian" and "organic social order". His business was severely affected by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929; he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment.  Between 1928 and 1935, he built only two buildings: a hotel near [[Chandler, Arizona]], and the most famous of all his residences, [[Fallingwater]] (1934–37), a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J. Kaufman. Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall, perfectly uniting architecture and nature.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=99}}

The Austrian architect [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]] designed what could be called the first house in the modern style in 1922, the Schindler house. 
Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell beach house in [[Newport Beach]]. The Austrian architect [[Richard Neutra]] moved to the United States in 1923, worked for short time with Frank Lloyd Wright, also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client, the [[Lovell House]] in [[Los Angeles]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]] in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco, and of pre-war architectural styles.  Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style, with colonnades and sculptural decoration.  The pavilions of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika, faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union, topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle.  As to the modernists, Le Corbusier was practically, but not quite invisible at the Exposition; he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux, but focused mainly on his painting.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=216}} The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier, [[Josep Lluis Sert]], the Spanish-Catalan architect, whose pavilion of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was pure modernist glass and steel box. Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition, the painting ''[[Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The original building was destroyed after the Exposition, but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona.

The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the [[Fascist architecture]] of Italy, and [[Nazi architecture]] of Germany, based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeur. The Nazi architecture, much of it designed by [[Albert Speer]], was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale.  Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe, more grand than Rome or Paris.  The Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States.  In Italy, Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=Frampton1&gt;{{cite book|last=Frampton|first=Kenneth|title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History|year=1980 |publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-20257-5|pages=210–218|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis;  the spirit of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Italian Rationalism]] of the 1920s continued, with the work of architect [[Giuseppe Terragni]] His ''Casa dl Fascio'' in Como, headquarters of the local Fascist party, was a perfectly modernist building,  with geometric proportions (33.2 meters long by 16.6 meters high);  a clean facade of marble, and a Renaissance-inspired interior courtyard.  Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini, a proponent of monumental fascist architecture, who rebuilt the University of Rome, and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[1939 New York World's Fair]] marked a turning point in architecture between the Art Deco and modern architecture.  The theme of the Fair was the ''World of Tomorrow'', and its symbols were the purely geometric trilon and perisphere sculpture. It had many monuments to Art Deco, such as the Ford Pavilion in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style, but also included the new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War. The Pavilions of Finland,  by [[Alvar Aalto]], of Sweden by [[Sven Markelius]], and of Brazil by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Lucio Costa]], looked forward to a new style.  They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[World War II]] (1939–1945) and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology, and in turn, architectural possibilities.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII /&gt;&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-032573-1 |pages= 41–42, 48–49 |editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials, leading to the adoption of new materials, such as aluminum, The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of [[prefabricated building]]; largely for the military and government. The semi-circular metal [[Nissen hut]] of World War I was revived as the [[Quonset hut]].  The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses, including the enameled-steel [[Lustron house]] (1947–1950), and Buckminster Fuller's experimental aluminum [[Dymaxion House]].&lt;ref name=Materials /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials |year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-032573-1|page=259|editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture.  Large parts of major cities, from Berlin, Tokyo and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London; all the port cities of France, particularly [[Le Havre]], Brest,  Marseille, Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing.  In the United States, little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s;  housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war.  The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous government-financed housing projects, usually in run-down center of American cities, and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities, where land was available,

One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre, destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944;  133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened, destroying 12,500 buildings and leaving 40,000 persons homeless. The architect [[Auguste Perret]], a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials, designed and built an entirely new center to the city, with apartment blocks, cultural, commercial and government buildings. He restored historic monuments when possible, and built a new church, St. Joseph,  with a lighthouse-like tower in the center to inspire hope.  His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=140-41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Shortly after the War, the French architect [[Le Corbusier]], who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years, was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in [[Marseille]].  He called it [[Unité d'Habitation]] in Marseille, but it more popularly took the name of the [[Cité Radieuse]], after his book about futuristic urban planning.  Following his doctrines of design, the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons.  it contained 337 duplex apartment units, fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle. Each unit had two levels and a small terrace.  Interior "streets"  had shops, a nursery school and other serves, and the flat terrace roof had a running track, ventilation ducts,  and a small theater.  Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional;  the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. Unité d'Habitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities, both in France and Germany.  Combined with his equally radical organic design for the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapel of Notre-Dame du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]], this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=152-163}}

==Postwar modernism in the United States (1945–1985)==
{{main article|International Style (architecture)}}
The [[International Style (architecture)|international Style]] of architecture had appeared in Europe, particularly in the [[Bauhaus]] movement,  in the late 1920s.  In 1932 it was recognized and given a name at an Exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City organized by architect [[Philip Johnson]] and architectural critic [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]],  Between 1937 and 1941, following the rise Hitler and the Nazis in Germany, most of the leaders of the German [[Bauhaus]] movement found a new home in the United States, and played an important part in the development of American modern architecture.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was eighty years old in 1947;  he had been present at the beginning of American modernism, and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement, continued to play a leading role almost to its end. One of his most original late projects was the campus of [[Florida Southern College]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]], begun in 1941 and completed in 1943.  He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as "The [[Child of the Sun]]". He wrote that he wanted the campus to "grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun."

He completed several notable projects in the 1940s, including the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] and the [[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville]], Oklahoma (1956). The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts;  the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core, like the branches of a tree. Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City.  That project was cancelled because of the [[Great Depression]], and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma.  He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings, but that in Oklahoma it stood alone.  The design is asymmetrical;  each side is different.

In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] to design a museum for his collection of modern art. His design was entirely original;  a bowl-shaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century.  Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959, the year that he died.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

[[Walter Gropius]], the founder of the [[Bauhaus]], moved to England in 1934 and spent three years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]];  Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty. [[Marcel Breuer]], who had worked with him at the Bauhaus, joined him and opened an office in Cambridge.  The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students, who themselves became famous architects, including [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Philip Johnson]].  They did not receive an important commission until 1941, when they designed housing for workers in Kensington, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.,  In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC ([[The Architects Collaborative]]).  Their notable works included the building of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956–57), and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York (1958–63).  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] described his architecture with the famous saying, "Less is more". As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] from 1939 to 1956, Mies (as he was commonly known) made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years.  He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style, two high-rise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive (1948–51), which became models for high-rises across the country.  Other major works included [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]] (1945–1951), a simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture.  The Chicago Convention Center (1952–54) and [[Crown Hall]] at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1950–56), and The [[Seagram Building]] in New York City (1954–58) also set a new standard for purity and elegance.  Based on granite pillars, the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronze-toned I-beams in the structure. He returned to Germany in 1962-68 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin.  His students and followers included [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Eero Saarinen]], whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=129}}

Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Charles and Ray Eames]].  The most celebrated work of the Eames was [[Eames House]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California,  (1949) Charles Eames in collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]]  It is composed of two structures, an architects residence and his studio,  joined in the form of an L. The house, influenced by Japanese architecture, is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes, often using natural materials, supported on a steel framework.  The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen.  He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=135}}

[[Richard Neutra]] continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles, using the theme of the simple box. Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235921/http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutra's [[Constance Perkins House]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (1962) was re-examination of the modest single-family dwelling.  It was built of inexpensive material–wood, plaster, and glass–and completed at a cost of just under $18,000. Neutra scaled the house to the physical dimensions of its owner, a small woman. It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house. One of Neutra's most unusual buildings was [[Shepherd's Grove]] in [[Garden Grove, California]], which featured an adjoining parking lot where worshippers could follow the service without leaving their cars.

Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural mega-agencies, which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects. The firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] was founded in Chicago in 1936 by [[Louis Skidmore]] and [[Nathaniel Owings]], and joined in 1939 by engineer [[John O. Merrill|John Merrill]],  It soon went under the name of SOM.  Its first big project was [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons. In 1964 the firm had eighteen "partner-owners", 54 "associate participants,"and 750 architects, technicians, designers, decorators, and landscape architects.  Their style was largely inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline, including the [[Lever House]] (1951-52) and the [[Manufacturers Trust Company Building]] (1954).  Later buildings by the firm include [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University]] (1963),  the [[Willis Tower]], formerly Sears Tower in Chicago (1973) and [[One World Trade Center]] in New York City  (2013), which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132-33}}

[[Wallace Harrison]] played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York;  as the architectural advisor of the [[Rockefeller Family]], he helped design [[Rockefeller Center]], the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s. He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York World's Fair, and, with his partner [[Max Abramowitz]], was the builder and chief architect of the [[United Nations Building]];  Harrison headed a committee of international architects, which included [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (who produced the original plan approved by the committee) and [[Le Corbusier]],    Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], the master plan for [[Lincoln Center]], and [[John F. Kennedy Airport]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005) was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture.  He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius, then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1946 to 1954. In 1947, he published a book about Mies van der Rohe, and in 1953 designed his own residence, the [[Glass House]] in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in a style modeled after Mies's [[Farnsworth House]]. Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction, moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture.  His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the AT&amp;T Building (later known as the Sony Tower, and now the [[550 Madison Avenue]] in New York City, (1979) an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of curved cap at the top of a piece of [[chippendale furniture]].  This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of [[Postmodern architecture]] in the United States.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

===Eero Saarinen===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Eero Saarinen]] (1910–1961) was the son of [[Eliel Saarinen]], the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University.  His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds.  In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan (1949–55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957–61).  His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the [[Ingalls Rink]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut (1956–59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables,  which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work,  the [[TWA Terminal]]  at JFK airport in New York (1956–1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey.  The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight.  Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure.  One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building,  including the benches, counters,  escalators and clocks, were designed in the same style.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=171-72}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Louis Kahn]] (1901–74) was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed from a wide variety of styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947–57, where his students included [[Eero Saarinen]].  From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  His work and ideas influenced [[Philip Johnson]], [[Minoru Yamasaki]], and [[Edward Durell Stone]]  as they moved toward a more neoclassical style.  Unlike Mies, he did not try to make his buildings look light;  he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid.  He drew from a wide variety of different sources;  the towers of [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], New York (1962);  and the [[Kimball Art Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas (1966–72).  Following the example of [[Le Corbusier]] and his design of the government buildings in [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] &amp; [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] State of India, Kahn designed the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] (National Assembly Building) in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (1962–74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn's last work.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=149}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[I. M. Pei]] (born 1917) is a major figure in late modernism and the debut of [[Post-modern architecture]]. He was born in China and educated in the United States, studying architecture at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. While the architecture school there still trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, Pei discovered the writings of [[Le Corbusier]], and a two-day visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Pei's ideas of architecture. In the late 1930s he moved to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied with [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] and became deeply involved in Modernism.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=36}}  After the War he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], before breaking away and starting his own firm. One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the clean modernist facade was admired, the building developed an unexpected problem; it created a wind-tunnel effect, and in strong winds the doors could not be opened. Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds.

Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]], in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism;  it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=59}}

In the late modernist area, art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects;  they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility.  Pei established himself with his design for the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] (1973), which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space, and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it.  This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period, the new East Wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, completed in 1978,  and to another of Pei's most famous projects, the pyramid at the entrance of [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris (1983–89). Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre., as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel, supporting 675 panels of glass, each 2.9 by 1.9 meters.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=210}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In France, [[Le Corbusier]] remained the most prominent architect, though he built few buildings there.  His most prominent late work was the convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in Evreaux-sur-l'Arbresle.  The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament,  inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy.  {{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=164-165}}

In Britain, the major figures in modernism included [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (1926–1992) and [[Denys Lasdun]] (1914–2001).  Lasdun's best-known work is the [[Royal National Theatre]] (1967–1976) on the south bank of the Thames.  Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists; [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] Prince Charles compared it with a nuclear power station.

In Belgium, a major figure was Charles Vandenhove (born 1927)  who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in [[Liege]].  His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles, such as Palladian architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=162}}

In Finland, the most influential architect was [[Alvar Aalto]], who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape, light, and materials, particularly the use of wood. After World War II, he taught architecture in the United States. In Sweden, [[Arne Jacobsen]] was the best-known of the modernists, who designed furniture as well as carefully-proportioned buildings.

In Italy, the most prominent modernist was [[Gio Ponti]], who worked often with the structural engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], a specialist in reinforced concrete.  Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length, twenty-five meters, which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights.  Their best-known design was the [[Pirelli Building]] in [[Milan]] (1958–1960), which for decades was the tallest building in Italy.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=164-165}}

The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect [[Josep Lluis Sert]], who worked with great success in Spain, France and the United States. In his early career he worked for a time under Le Corbusier, and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition. His notable later work included the [[Fondation Maeght]] in Saint-Paul-de-Provence, France (1964), and the [[Harvard Science Center]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as Dean of Architecture at the [[Harvard School of Design]].

Notable German modernists included [[Johannes Krahn]], who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II, and built several important museums and churches, notably [[St. Martin, Idstein]], which artfully combined stone masonry, concrete and glass.  Leading Austrian architects of the style included [[Gustav Peichl]], whose later works included the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic]] in Bonn, Germany (1989).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Brazil]] became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of [[Lucio Costa]] (1902–1998) and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (1907–2012).  Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1936–43) and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.  Following the war, Niemeyer, along with Le Corbusier, conceived the form of the [[United Nations Headquarters]] constructed by Walter Harrison.

Lucio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil;  the creation of a new capital, [[Brasilia]], constructed between 1956 and 1961.  Costa made the general plan, laid out in the form of a cross, with the major government buildings in the center.  Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings, including the palace of the President;the National Assembly, composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls, one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola. Niemeyer also built the cathedral, eighteen ministries, and giant blocks of housing, each designed for three thousand residents, each with its own school, shops, and chapel. Modernism was employed both as an architectural principle and as a guideline for organizing society, as explored in ''[[The Modernist City]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19722338|title=The modernist city : an anthropological critique of Brasília|last=James.|first=Holston,|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226349794|location=Chicago|oclc=19722338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a military coup d'état in Brazil in 1964, Niemeyer moved to France, where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris (1965–1980), a miniature of his United Nations plan.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=165-167}}

Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement.  Important figures included Félix Candela, born in Spain, who emigrated to Mexico in 1939, and participated in the construction of the new University of Mexico City;  he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms. Another important figure was [[Mario Pani]], who designed the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in Mexico City (1949), and the [[Torre Insignia]] (1988). [[Augusto H. Alvarez]] designed the [[Torre Latinamericano]], one of the early modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City (1956);  it successfully withstood the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which destroyed many other buildings in the city center.  1964. [[Pedro Ramirez Vasquez]] and [[Rafael Mijares]]  designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics, and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports. [[Luis Barragan]] was another influential figure in Mexican modernism;  his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside, while inside it features great simplicity in form, pure colors, abundant natural light, and, one of is signatures, a stairway without a railing.  He won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] in 1980,  and the house was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=166}}

Japan, like Europe, had an enormous shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities.  4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced.  Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques.  One of the foremost Japanese modernists was [[Kunio Maekawa]] (1905–1986), who had worked for Le Corbusier in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier.  His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.

[[Kenzo Tange]] (1913–2005) worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm. His first major commission was the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] .  He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers. office buildings, as well as the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.  The gymasim, built of concrete, features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables.

The Danish architect [[Jorn Utzon]] (1918-) worked briefly with [[Alvar Aalto]], studied the work of Le Corbusier, and traveled to the United States to meet [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world;  the [[Sydney Opera House]]..  He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings, and their relationship with the landscape. The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach.  Begun in 1957, the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right. Utzon resigned in 1966, and the opera house was not finished until 1973, ten years after its scheduled completion.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=157}}

==Preservation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]]. In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau, these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article: the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] in Utrecht, the [[Bauhaus]] structures in Weimar and Dessau, the [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates]], the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]], the city of [[Asmara]], the city of [[Brasilia]], the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] of [[UNAM]] in Mexico City and the [[University City of Caracas]] in Venezuela, and the [[Sydney Opera House]].

Private organizations such as [[Docomomo International]], the [[World Monuments Fund]], and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund launched [[World Monuments Fund#Modernism at Risk|''Modernism at Risk'']], an advocacy and conservation program.

[[Music]] can be described and represented in many different ways including [[sheet music]], symbolic representations, and audio recordings. For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of '''music alignment''' (sometimes also referred to as '''music synchronization''') is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER&gt;

==Basic procedure==
[[File:MusicAlignment Procedure.png|thumb|300px|right|Overview of the processing pipeline of a typical music alignment procedure.]]

Given two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER/&gt; In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of [[robustness]] to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses '''[[chroma feature|chroma-based features]]''' (also called [[chromagram]]s or [[harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]]), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used.

In the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to '''[[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]]''' or '''[[hidden Markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]''' are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences.

==Related tasks==
Music alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of [[music information retrieval]]. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score–audio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the  [[offline]] scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as [[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]] to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as '''[[score following]]''', where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency.&lt;ref&gt;

However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as '''[[Pop music automation#Automatic accompaniment|automatic accompaniment]]'''. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Jiu Xiao Huan Pei.jpg|thumb|300px|A famous [[Tang Dynasty]] guqin "Jiu Xiao Huan Pei". The [[guqin]] has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement.]]

'''Music history''', sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of [[musicology]] that studies music from a historical viewpoint.
In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of [[ethnomusicology]] or [[cultural studies]], whether or not they are [[ethnography|ethnographically based]]. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. [[manuscript]] studies), [[paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), [[musical analysis]], and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, [[biographies|biography]] of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between [[word]]s and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in [[society]].

==Pedagogy==
Although most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music, art pop, or rock and roll history from teachers throughout their training, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the [[college]] level.  In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory certification at the Grade 9 level and higher

Most medium and large institutions will offer both types of courses.  The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the [[Baroque music|late Baroque]] or [[Classical music era|classical]] eras and might omit music after [[World War II|WWII]] while courses for majors traditionally span the period from the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] to recent times), and depth. Both types of courses tend to emphasize a balance among the acquisition of musical [[repertory]] (often emphasized through listening examinations), study and analysis of these works, biographical and cultural details of music and musicians, and writing about music, perhaps through [[music criticism]].

More specialized seminars in music history tend to use a similar approach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history.The range of possible topics is virtually limitless.  Some examples might be "Music during [[World War I]]," "Medieval and Renaissance [[musical instrument|instrumental]] music," "Music and Process," "[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''Don Giovanni''."

The methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. It should also be noted that the act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.

'''Archival work''' may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican]] pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician.  In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, [[Archive|archival]] work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the [[Arnold Schoenberg]] Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/ Schoenberg.at]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Performance practice''' draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although [[performance practice]] was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in [[Klezmer]] music.

'''Biographical studies''' of composers can give a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works.  Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.

'''Sociological studies''' focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called [[New musicology|New musicologists]].

'''Semiotic studies''' are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians.  However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context.  The interpretative work of scholars such as [[Kofi Agawu]] and [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] fall between the analytic and the music historical.

==History==

===Before 1800===
The first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. [[Giovanni Battista Martini|G.B. Martini]] published a three volume history titled ''Storia della musica'' (''History of Music'') between 1757 and 1781. [[Martin Gerbert]] published a two volume history of sacred music titled ''De cantu de musica sacra'' in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work ''Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra'' containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.

===1800–1950===
[[Image:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s manuscript sketch for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
In the 20th century, the work of [[:de:Johannes Wolf (Musikwissenschaftler)|Johannes Wolf]] and others developed studies in [[Medieval music]] and early [[Renaissance music]]. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in [[Baroque music]] as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the [[authentic performance]] movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study.  Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research.  The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.

==Critiques==

=== Exclusion of disciplines and musics ===
In its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than "classical" ("art", "serious", "high culture") or notated ("artificial") – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice.  The musicological sub-disciplines of [[music theory]] and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.

Within historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to [[Susan McClary]] (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;1285) the discipline of "music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded." Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;10). In McClary's words (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;5), "It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways." Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often "dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society." (1988,  p.&amp;nbsp;283)

=== Exclusion of popular music ===
According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990—that most major "works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist"—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are "both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a ''different'' kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking"

He cites three main aspects of this problem (p.&amp;nbsp;104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is "slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music')." He acknowledges that "there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus"; yet he points out that there is "an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of "terms are ideologically loaded" in that "they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music ''is''."

As well, he claims that historical musicology uses "a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation," 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;28–32). As a result, "musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to "neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the "notation-centric training" of Western music schools "induces particular forms of ''listening'', and these then tend to be applied to ''all'' sorts of music, appropriately or not". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a [[funk]] or [[Latin American music|Latin]] song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.

Notational centricity also encourages "reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form." As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has "an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical ''practice'' of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention." These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not "that musicology ''cannot'' understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology."  (Middleton, p.&amp;nbsp;104).

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The company complains that Uruguay's [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]] devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the [[bilateral investment treaty]] between Switzerland and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; (Philip Morris is headquartered in [[Lausanne]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_ch.aspx | title =Philip Morris International Management SA - Switzerland Operations Centre | author = [[Philip Morris International|PMI]] | accessdate = 15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding [[arbitration]] before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | title=Uruguay Wins Dispute With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris | work=ABC News | date=8 July 2016 | author=AP | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709143704/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | archive-date=2016-07-09 | access-date=23 October 2016 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay had received accolades from the [[World Health Organization]] and from anti-smoking activists for its [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/208683/cigarrillos-mentolados-aumentan-la-adiccion/|title = Cigarrillos mentolados aumentan la adicción|author = El Observador |date = 6 September 2011|accessdate =13 September 2011 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016, after 6 years, the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the expenses of the defendants and the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html |title =Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-36752509|title =Histórico fallo a favor de Uruguay en el juicio contra la tabacalera Philip Morris|author =BCC |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/esta-es-la-historia-de-uruguay-david-contra-philip-morris-goliath.html |title =Esta es la historia de Uruguay (David) contra Philip Morris (Goliath) |author =elfinanciero|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

After its victory in the case, the government declared that from 2017 cigarettes in Uruguay will be sold in [[Plain tobacco packaging|generic packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/a-partir-2017-los-cigarrillos-se-venderan-empaquetado-generico-n940912 |title =A partir de 2017 los cigarrillos se venderán en empaquetado genérico  |author= El Observador|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.teledoce.com/telemundo/nacionales/vazquez-anuncio-en-cadena-nacional-que-uruguay-gano-juicio-a-philips-morris/|title= Vázquez anunció en cadena nacional que Uruguay ganó juicio a Philips Morris|author = Canal 12|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/1302400-tabare-vazquez-aclaro-prohibicion-fumar-areas-publica-cerradas-incluye-marihuana |title = Drogas|author  = LR21|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

{{History of printing}}

A '''printing press''' is a device for applying pressure to an [[ink]]ed surface resting upon a [[printing|print]] medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and [[global spread of the printing press]] was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=10 March 2010 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]], a [[goldsmith]] by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. [[History of printing in East Asia|Printing in East Asia]] had been prevalent since the [[Tang dynasty]],&lt;ref name=Needham /&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; and in Europe, [[woodblock printing]] based on existing [[screw press]]es was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised [[matrix (printing)|hand mould]] made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal [[movable type]] in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.

The printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout [[Western Europe]] had already produced more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new medium of expression and communication, "[[Newspaper|the press]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}: {{quote|At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]], which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], and accelerated by the development of European [[vernacular language]]s, to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp.63–76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by [[steam-powered]] [[rotary press]]es allowed printing on an [[industrial age|industrial]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhardt|1978|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of printing}}

=== Economic conditions and intellectual climate ===
{{See also|History of capitalism|Medieval university}} 
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval university]] class (1350s)]]

The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval society]] in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of [[history of capitalism|emerging capitalism]] increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of [[Medieval university|medieval learning]] and literacy amongst the [[middle class]] led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological factors ===
{{See also|History of Western typography|Medieval technology}}

Technologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43294-8|page=133|edition=1st|date=1994-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

[[File:Holzspindelkelter von 1702.jpg|thumb|left|Early modern [[wine press]]. Such [[screw press]]es were applied in Europe to a wide range of uses and provided Gutenberg with the model for his printing press.]]

The [[screw press]] which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=21–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in the 1st century AD by the [[Roman agriculture|Romans]], it was commonly employed in agricultural production for [[Pressing (wine)|pressing]] [[vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] and ([[olive]]) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onken|2009}}; {{harvnb|White|1984|pp=31f.}}; {{harvnb|Schneider|2007|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a [[cloth]] press for printing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|2007|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the [[paper]] presses which had spread through the [[Holy Roman Empire|German lands]] since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schulte|1939|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the [[platen]] on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:metal movable type.jpg|thumb|[[Movable type]] sorted in a [[letter case]] and loaded in a [[composing stick]] on top]]

The concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been [[History of science and technology in China|invented in China]] during the [[Song dynasty]], and was later used in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], where [[metal]] movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, sporadic evidence that the [[typographical principle]], the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany ([[Prüfening dedicatory inscription|Prüfening inscription]]) to England ([[letter tiles]]) to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Germany: {{harvnb|Brekle|1995|pp=23–26}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=25}}; England: {{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=93–97}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; Italy: {{harvnb|Lipinsky|1986|pp=75–80}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1994|p=213}}. Lipinsky surmises that this typographical technique was known in [[Constantinople]] from the 10th to 12th century and that the [[Venice|Venetians]] received it from there (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.

Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating [[typesetting]] and [[printing]] as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a [[lead]]-based [[alloy]] which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.&lt;ref name="EB: Printing"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 2006: "Printing", retrieved 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special [[hand mould]], the [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="Childress 2008, 51–55"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]] proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to [[Logogram|logographic writing systems]], it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different [[letter (alphabet)|letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51–55}}; {{harvnb|Hellinga|2007|p=208}}: {{quote|Gutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the [[codex]], which had originated in the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] [[scroll]] at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=1, 38–67, 75}}: {{quote|The most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing − and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45–53}}. Technically speaking, a scroll could be written on its back side, too, but the very few ancient specimen found indicate that this was never considered a viable option. (p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A paper [[codex]] of the acclaimed [[42-line Bible]], Gutenberg's major work]]

A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing [[paper]] manufacture. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=68−73}}; {{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim papermaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997|pp=41–44}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=419}}: {{quote|In the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=7f.}}: {{quote|Despite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the [[42-line Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;The ratio between paper and parchment copies is estimated at around 150 to 30 ({{harvnb|Hanebutt-Benz|2000|pp=158–189}}).&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Press skeen 1872 with description.png|thumb|left|Early Press, etching from Early Typography by William Skeen]] [[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks. Such a duo could reach 14,000 hand movements per working day, printing around 3,600 pages in the process.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f.}}: {{quote|From old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]A printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from {{convert|5|to|7|ft}} long, {{convert|3|ft}} wide, and {{convert|7|ft}} tall. The small individual metal letters known as type would be set up by a compositor into the desired lines of text. Several lines of text would be arranged at once and were placed in a wooden frame known as a galley. Once the correct number of pages were composed, the galleys would be laid face up in a frame, also known as a forme.&lt;ref&gt; Lyons 2011, p. 59 &lt;/ref&gt;, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressinstitute.in/file-folder/rindsurvey/Rind%20June%202015%20SN.pdf] RIND Survey (The Press Institute of India- Research Institute for Newspaper Development) June 2015, p14&lt;/ref&gt; and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a [[frisket]] and [[tympan]] (two frames covered with paper or parchment).

These are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the [[platen]], using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power. 

The function of the press in the image on the left was described by William Skeen in 1872,
{{quotation | this sketch represents a press in its completed form, with tympans attached to the end of the carriage, and with the frisket above the tympans. The tympans, inner and outer, are thin iron frames, one fitting into the other, on each of which is stretched a skin of parchment or a breadth of fine cloth. A woollen blanket or two with a few sheets of paper are placed between these, the whole thus forming a thin elastic pad, on which the sheet to be printed is laid. The frisket is a slender frame-work, covered with coarse paper, on which an impression is first taken; the whole of the printed part is then cut out, leaving apertures exactly corresponding with the pages of type on the carriage of the press. The frisket when folded on to the tympans, and both turned down over the forme of types and run in under the platten, preserves the sheet from contact with any thing but the inked surface of the types, when the pull, which brings down the screw and forces the platten to produce the impression, is made by the pressman who works the lever,—to whom is facetiously given the title of “the practitioner at the bar.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Early Typography|last = Skeen|first =William|publisher =Government Printer, Colombo |year =1872|isbn = |location =Ceylon|pages = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Gutenberg's press ==
{{See also|Letterpress printing}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn—a man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; However, it was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an [[alloy]] of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]], which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His [[type case]] is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, [[typographic ligature|ligatures]], punctuation marks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahnke|2009|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based [[ink]] which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and [[vellum]] (high-quality parchment). In the [[Gutenberg Bible]], Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work, the [[Mainz Psalter]] of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], had elaborate red and blue printed initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Printing Revolution ==

The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an "agent of change" through the societies that it reached. ([[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein|Eisenstein (1980)]])

=== Mass production and spread of printed books ===
{{See also|Global spread of the printing press|List of early modern newspapers}}
[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|left|Spread of printing in the 15th century from [[Mainz]], Germany]]
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|The European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buringh|van Zanden|2009|p=417, table 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in [[Mainz]], Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, [[Bohemia]] and Poland.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; From that time on, it is assumed that "the printed book was in universal use in Europe".&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

In Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa|1976|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Borsa|1977|p=166−169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollak |first1=Michael|title=The performance of the wooden printing press|journal=The Library Quarterly|date=1972|volume=42|issue=2|pages=218–264|jstor=4306163}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[History of printing in East Asia|book printing in East Asia]] did not use presses and was solely done by [[block printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1965, p. 211: {{quote|The outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.}} {{harvnb|Widmann|1974|p=34, fn. 14}}: {{quote|In East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.}}  {{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002|pp=112–115}}: {{quote|Chinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didn’t have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Erasmus]]'s work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469–1536).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Issawi|1980|pp=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and [[papacy]] alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first [[newspaper]]s (see ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'') which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|pp=387f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incunable]] are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;The British Library [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 29,777 separate ''editions'' (not copies) as of 8 January 2008, which however includes some print items from the 16th century (retrieved 11 March 2010). According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, München 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207–224 (207f.), the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] lists 28,107 editions published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of [[scientists]] who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the [[scientific revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Because of the printing press, [[author]]ship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, "One Author, one work (title), one piece of information" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of [[Aristotle]] made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Because the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Josh. “The State of Publishing: Literacy Rates.” ''McSweeney’s Internet Tendency''. McSweeney, 5 July 2011. Web. 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was an important step towards the [[democratization of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html Malte Herwig, "Google's Total Library", ''Spiegel Online International'', Mar. 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/technology/1057780670.php Howard Rheingold, "Moblogs Seen as a Crystal Ball for a New Era in Online Journalism", ''Online Journalism Review'', Jul. 9, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first [[copyright]] laws were passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/2486-copyright-timeline#.Wl1E7ainHIU|title=Copyright Timeline: A History of Copyright in the United States {{!}} Association of Research Libraries® {{!}} ARL®|last=Eshgh|first=Amy|website=www.arl.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.&lt;ref name="CrickWalsham2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia C. Crick|author2=Alexandra Walsham|title=The uses of script and print, 1300–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8005wHw-KsC|accessdate=25 March 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81063-0|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Bilton|title=I Live in the Future &amp; Here's How It Works: Why Your World, Work, and Brain Are Being Creatively Disrupted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VXRLlTDNrUC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=14 September 2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-59111-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited{{Who|date=March 2015}} as one of the causes of the rise of [[nationalism]] in Europe.

A third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.&lt;ref name="Dittmar2011"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Jeremiah Dittmar|title=Information technology and economic change: The impact of the printing press|url=http://voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=VoxEU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like [[double-entry bookkeeping]] increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.&lt;ref name="Raj2017"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Prateek Raj|title=How the Postal System and the Printing Press Transformed European Markets|url=http://evonomics.com/europe-markets-guilds-merchants-declined/|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=Evonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial printing presses ==
{{See also|History of printing}}
At the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130–133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.

[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Koenig|Koenig]]'s 1814 steam-powered printing press]]

Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met [[Thomas Bensley]] and secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer [[Andreas Friedrich Bauer]].

Koenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to ''[[The Times]]'' in [[London]] in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making [[newspaper]]s available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of [[book]] production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other [[metadata (computing)|metadata]]. Their company [[Koenig &amp; Bauer AG]] is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.

===Rotary press===
The steam powered [[rotary printing press]], invented in 1843 in the [[United States]] by [[Richard M. Hoe]],&lt;ref name="meggs147"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip B.|authorlink=Philip B. Meggs|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1998|location=|edition=Third|page=147|isbn=978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.

By the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Also, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of [[jobbing presses]], small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as [[billhead]]s, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.

'''RV ''Rachel Carson''''' is a research vessel owned and operated by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Environmental Science, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]].

The 81-foot aluminum-hulled vessel is an extended and modified Challenger class fast research vessel, designed by marine architect Roger Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |title=Research Vessel Design |work=JMS Naval Architects &amp; Salvage Engineers |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107205725/http://jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is equipped with twin 1,200 horsepower diesel engines and water jet drives which give a maximum speed of 24 knots. A [[Dynamic positioning|dynamic positioning system]] automatically maintains the vessel's position.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The ship was built by [[Hike Metal Products]] of [[Wheatley, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="umces"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umces.edu/research-discovery/rv-rachel-carson |title=The R/V Rachel Carson |work=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $4.6 million, and christened by [[Katie O'Malley]] on November 16, 2008, at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V07N4/side3/ |title=New R/V Rachel Carson Commissioned |work=Chesapeake Quarterly |year=2008 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rachel Carson'' has operated in [[Chesapeake Bay]] since early 2009, teaching estuarine sampling techniques, carrying out water quality surveys, [[plankton]] collection, [[Box corer|box coring]] operations, and deploying instrument packages.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

Different populations in a community exist in relative proportions; this idea is known as relative abundance.

==Introduction==

===Relative species abundance===
[[File:Hollow curve beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''. Relative species abundance of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing the universal "hollow curve". (derived from data presented in Magurran (2004)&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; and collected by [[C.B. Williams]] (1964)&lt;ref name=Williams64&gt;Williams, C.B. 1964. ''Patterns in the balance of nature and related problems in quantitative ecology''. Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
Relative species abundance and species richness describe key elements of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Relative species abundance refers to how common or rare a species is relative to other species in a given location or community.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;McGill, B. J., Etienne R. S., Gray J. S., Alonso D., Anderson M. J., Benecha H. K., Dornelas M., Enquist B. J., Green J. L., He F., Hurlbert A. H., Magurran A. E., Marquet P. A., Maurer B. A., Ostling A., Soykan C. U., Ugland K. I., White E. P. 2007. "Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework". ''Ecology Letters'' 10: 995–1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually relative species abundances are described for a single [[trophic level]]. Because such species occupy the same [[trophic level]] they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; For example, relative species abundances might describe all terrestrial birds in a forest community or all [[planktonic]] [[copepods]] in a particular marine environment.

Relative species abundances follow very similar patterns over a wide range of ecological communities. When plotted as a histogram of the number of species represented by 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals usually fit a hollow curve, such that most species are rare, (represented by a single individual in a community sample) and relatively few species are abundant (represented by a large number of individuals in a community sample)(Figure 1).&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt; This pattern has been long-recognized and can be broadly summarized with the statement that "most species are rare".&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H. G.; Birch L. C. 1954. ''The Distribution and Abundance of Animals''. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Charles Darwin]] noted in 1859 in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' that "... rarity is the attribute of vast numbers of species in all classes...."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 2004 (1859). ''The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. Castle Books, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species abundance patterns can be best visualized in the form of relative abundance distribution plots. The consistency of relative species abundance patterns suggests that some common macroecological "rule" or process determines the distribution of individuals among species within a trophic level.

===Distribution plots===
[[File:PrestonPlot beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. ''Preston plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a strong right-skew.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
[[File:Rank abundance beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Whittaker plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a slight "s"-shape.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
Relative species abundance distributions are usually graphed as frequency histograms ("Preston plots"; Figure 2)&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite journal | author = Preston, F. W. | year = 1948 | title = The Commonness, and Rarity, of Species | journal = Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–283 | url = http://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Vegecology/Papers/Preston48.pdf | doi = 10.2307/1930989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rank abundance curve|rank-abundance diagrams]] ("Whittaker Plots"; Figure 3).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1965. "Dominance and diversity in land plant communities", ''Science'' 147: 250–260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency histogram (Preston plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': logarithm of abundance bins (historically log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a rough approximation to the natural logarithm)

::'''''y''-axis''': number of species at given abundance

'''Rank-abundance diagram (Whittaker plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': species list, ranked in order of descending abundance (i.e. from common to rare)

::'''''y''-axis''': logarithm of % relative abundance

When plotted in these ways, relative species abundances from wildly different data sets show similar patterns: frequency histograms tend to be right-skewed (e.g. Figure 2) and rank-abundance diagrams tend to conform to the curves illustrated in Figure 4.

==Understanding relative species abundance patterns==
Researchers attempting to understand relative species abundance patterns usually approach them in a descriptive or mechanistic way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt to fit a mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, mechanistic approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1999. ''Species coexistence: ecological and evolutionary perspectives''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Succession.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Plant succession in abandoned fields within Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY. Species abundances conform to the geometric series during early succession but approach lognormal as the community ages. (modified from Whittaker 1972&lt;ref name=Whittaker72&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1972. "Evolution and measurement of species diversity". ''Taxon'' 21:213&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
I. Motomura developed the geometric series model based on benthic community data in a lake.&lt;ref name=Motomura&gt;Motomura, I. 1932. "A statistical treatment of associations", ''Japanese Journal of Zoology''. 44: 379–383 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the geometric series each species' level of abundance is a sequential, constant proportion (''k'') of the total number of individuals in the community. Thus if ''k'' is 0.5, the most common species would represent half of individuals in the community (50%), the second most common species would represent half of the remaining half (25%), the third, half of the remaining quarter (12.5%) and so forth.

Although Motomura originally developed the model as a statistical (descriptive) means to plot observed abundances, the "discovery" of his paper by Western researchers in 1965 led to the model being used as a [[niche apportionment models|niche apportionment model]] &amp;ndash; the "niche-preemption model".&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt; In a mechanistic model ''k'' represents the proportion of the resource base acquired by a given species.

The geometric series rank-abundance diagram is linear with a slope of –''k'', and reflects a rapid decrease in species abundances by rank (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Motomura/&gt; The geometric series does not explicitly assume that species colonize an area sequentially, however, the model fits the concept of niche preemption, where species sequentially colonize a region and the first species to arrive receives the majority of resources.&lt;ref name=He_Tang&gt;He , F., Tang D. 2008. "Estimating the niche preemption parameter of the geometric series" ''Acta Oecologica'' 33 (1):105&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt; The geometric series model fits observed species abundances in highly uneven communities with low diversity.&lt;ref name=He_Tang/&gt; This is expected to occur in terrestrial plant communities (as these assemblages often show strong dominance) as well as communities at early successional stages and those in harsh or isolated environments (Figure 5).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt;

====Logseries (Fisher ''et al'' 1943)====

: &lt;math&gt;S=\alpha\ln{\left(1+{N\over{\alpha\,\!}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

''where'':

:''S'' = the number of species in the sampled community

:''N'' = the number of individuals sampled

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = a constant derived from the sample data set

The logseries was developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to fit two different abundance data sets: British moth species (collected by [[Carrington Bonsor Williams|Carrington Williams]]) and Malaya butterflies (collected by [[Alexander Steven Corbet]]).&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal&gt;Fisher, R. A; Corbet, A. S.; Williams, C. B. 1943. "The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample of an animal population". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 12: 42&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic behind the derivation of the logseries is varied&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. L.; Adrienne, W. K.; Kotz, S. (2005). ''Univariate and Discrete Distributions'', 3rd edn. John Wiley and Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; however Fisher proposed that sampled species abundances would follow a negative binomial from which the zero abundance class (species too rare to be sampled) was eliminated.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; He also assumed that the total number of species in a community was infinite. Together, this produced the [[logarithmic series distribution|logseries distribution]] (Figure 4). The logseries predicts the number of species at different levels of abundance (''n'' individuals) with the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n= {\alpha\,\!x^n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:S = the number of species with an abundance of ''n''

:''x''&amp;nbsp;= a positive constant (0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1) which is derived from the sample data set and generally approaches 1 in value

The number of species with 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals are therefore:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha, {\alpha\,\!x^2\over{2}}, {\alpha\,\!x^3\over{3}}, \dots, {\alpha\,\!x^n\over{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

=====Fisher’s constants=====
[[File:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ronald Fisher]]
The constants ''α'' and ''x'' can be estimated through iteration from a given species data set using the values ''S'' and ''N''.&lt;ref name=Magurran04&gt;Magurran, A. E. 2004. ''Measuring biological diversity''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher's [[dimensionless]] ''α'' is often used as a measure of biodiversity, and indeed has recently been found to represent the fundamental biodiversity parameter ''θ'' from neutral theory ([[Relative species abundance#Fisher.E2.80.99s alpha and Hubbell.E2.80.99s theta .E2.80.93 an interesting convergence|see below]]).

====Log normal (Preston 1948)====
[[File:Prestonsveil copy.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. An example of Preston's veil. Fish species abundances sampled using repeated trawling over a one-month (blue bars), two month (gold bars) and one-year period (yellow). One year of sampling indicates that the fish community is log-normally distributed. (derived from Magurran 2004&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;)]]
Using several data sets (including breeding bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) [[Frank W. Preston]] (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a [[Gaussian function|Normal (Gaussian) distribution]], partly as a result of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; This means that the abundance distribution is [[Lognormal]]. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher ''et al.'' (1943)&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal/&gt;) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the ''x''-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed ''Preston's veil line''. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magurran88/&gt;(Figure 6).  Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;

=====Calculating theoretical species richness=====
Preston's theory has an application: if a community is truly lognormal yet under-sampled, the lognormal distribution can be used to estimate the true species richness of a community. Assuming the shape of the total distribution can be confidently predicted from the collected data, the normal curve can be fit via statistical software or by completing the [[Gaussian function|Gaussian formula]]:&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n = n_0 e^{-(aR)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of species in the modal bin (the peak of the curve)
 
:''n'' is the number of species in bins ''R'' distant from the modal bin

:''a'' is a constant derived from the data

It is then possible to predict how many species are in the community by calculating the total area under the curve&amp;nbsp;(''N''):

: &lt;math&gt;N= {n_0\sqrt{\pi}\over a}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of species missing from the data set (the missing area to the left of the veil line) is simply ''N'' minus the number of species sampled.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; Preston did this for two lepidopteran data sets, predicting that, even after 22 years of collection, only 72% and 88% of the species present had been sampled.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

====Yule model (Nee 2003) ====
The Yule model is based on a much earlier, [[Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process|Galton&amp;ndash;Watson model]] which was used to describe the distribution of species among [[genera]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule, G. U. 1924. "A mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, FRS". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'' 213: 21–87&lt;/ref&gt; The Yule model assumes random branching of species trees, with each species (branch tip) having the equivalent probability of giving rise to new species or becoming extinct. As the number of species within a genus, within a clade, has a similar distribution to the number of individuals within a species, within a community (i.e. the "hollow curve"), Sean Nee (2003) used the model to describe relative species abundances.&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nee&gt;Nee, S. 2003. "The unified phenomenological theory of biodiversity". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways this model is similar to [[niche apportionment models]], however, Nee intentionally did not propose a biological mechanism for the model behavior, arguing that any distribution can be produced by a variety of mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Nee/&gt;

===Mechanistic approaches: niche apportionment===
''Note'': This section provides a general summary of niche apportionment theory, more information can be found under [[niche apportionment models]].

Most mechanistic approaches to species abundance distributions use niche-space, i.e. available resources, as the mechanism driving abundances. If species in the same [[trophic level]] consume the same resources (such as nutrients or sunlight in plant communities, prey in carnivore communities, nesting locations or food in bird communities) and these resources are limited, how the resource "pie" is divided among species determines how many individuals of each species can exist in the community. Species with access to lots of resources will have higher carrying capacities than those with little access. Mutsunori Tokeshi&lt;ref&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1990. "Niche apportionment or random assortment: species abundance patterns revisited". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 59: 1129&amp;ndash;1146&lt;/ref&gt; later elaborated niche apportionment theory to include niche filling in unexploited resource space.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99/&gt; Thus, a species may survive in the community by carving out a portion of another species' niche (slicing up the pie into smaller pieces) or by moving into a vacant niche (essentially making the pie larger, for example, by being the first to arrive in a newly available location or through the development of a novel trait that allows access previously unavailable resources). Numerous [[niche apportionment models]] have been developed. Each make different assumptions about how species carve up niche-space.

====Unified neutral theory (Hubbell 1979/2001)====
{{main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) is a special form of mechanistic model that takes an entirely different approach to community composition than the niche apportionment models.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Instead of species populations reaching equilibrium within a community, the UNTB model is dynamic, allowing for continuing changes in relative species abundances through drift.

A community in the UNTB model can be best visualized as a grid with a certain number of spaces, each occupied with individuals of different species.  The model is [[zero-sum]] as there are a limited number of spaces that can be occupied: an increase in the number of individuals of one species in the grid must result in corresponding decrease in the number of individuals of other species in the grid. The model then uses birth, death, immigration, extinction and speciation to modify community composition over time.

;Hubbell's theta

The UNTB model produces a dimensionless "fundamental biodiversity" number,&amp;nbsp;''θ'', which is derived using the formula:

: ''θ'' = 2''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''

''where'':

: ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the size of the metacommunity (the outside source of immigrants to the local community)

:''v'' is the speciation rate in the model

Relative species abundances in the UNTB model follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake&gt;Hubbell, S. P.; Lake J. 2003. "The neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity: and beyond". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of this distribution is a function of the immigration rate, the size of the sampled community (grid), and&amp;nbsp;''θ''.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake/&gt; When the value of ''θ'' is small, the relative species abundance distribution is similar to the geometric series (high dominance). As ''θ'' gets larger, the distribution becomes increasingly s-shaped (log-normal) and, as it approaches infinity, the curve becomes flat (the community has infinite diversity and species abundances of one). Finally, when ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the community described consists of only one species (extreme dominance).&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

===== Fisher's alpha and Hubbell's theta – an interesting convergence=====

An unexpected result of the UNTB is that at very large sample sizes, predicted relative species abundance curves describe the [[metacommunity]] and become identical to Fisher's logseries. At this point ''θ'' also becomes identical to Fisher's &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the equivalent distribution and Fisher's constant ''x'' is equal to the ratio of birthrate : deathrate. Thus, the UNTB unintentionally offers a mechanistic explanation of the logseries 50 years after Fisher first developed his descriptive model.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

'''Semiotics''' (also called '''semiotic studies''') is the study of [[sign process]] ([[semiosis]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], which is a subset of semiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/semiology.html|title=Semiology vs. semiotics|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[allegory]], [[metonymy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication.

The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Different from linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign system]]s.

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.&lt;ref name=caesar&gt;{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the [[life sciences]]—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]]).

==Terminology==
The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmeiwtiko%2Fs σημειωτικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (from σημεῖον ''sēmeion'', "a sign, a mark")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmei%3Don σημεῖον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and it was first used in English prior to 1676 by [[Henry Stubbes]]&lt;ref&gt;Stubbes, H.,''The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus'' ... (London, England, 1670), page 75: "... nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), '''semeiotics''', method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines ...."&lt;/ref&gt; (spelt ''semeiotics'') in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs.&lt;ref&gt;"The branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Greeks, "signs" occurred in the world of nature, "symbols" in the world of culture. Not until [[Augustine of Hippo]] would a thematic proposal for uniting the two under the notion of "sign" (''signum'') as transcending the nature-culture divide and identifying symbols as no more than a species (or sub-species) of ''signum'' be formally proposed. See the monograph study on this question, ''Le teorie del segno nell'antichità classica'' by Giovanni Manetti (Milan: Bompiani, 1987); trans. by Christine Richardson as ''Theories of the Sign in Classical Antiquity'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993). Classic also is the article by Luigi Romeo, "The Derivation of 'Semiotics' through the History of the Discipline", in ''Semiosis'' 6, Heft 2 (1977), 37–49. See also Andrew LaVelle's discussion of Romeo on Peirce-l at [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/3252].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] used the term ''sem(e)iotike'' in book four, chapter 21 of ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/semiotics|title=semiotics {{!}} study of signs|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke used  the Greek word σημιωτική{{sic}}&lt;!--ι, not ει--&gt; in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=hGeKsjjtu6EC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s 4th ed. of 1700] (p. 437) of his ''Essay concerning Human Understanding''. He notably writes both (a) "σημιωτικὴ"&lt;!--non-capitalized first letter and featuring a grave-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (main text)--&gt; and (b) "Σημιωτική"&lt;!--capitalized first letter and featuring an acute-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (margins)--&gt;—when term (a) is followed by any kind of punctuation mark, it takes the form (b); see ''[[Ancient Greek accent]]''. The 1689/1690 first edition of Locke's ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'', in the concluding "Division of the Sciences" chapter, Locke introduces, in §4, "σημιωτική" as his proposed name synonymous with "''the Doctrine of Signs''" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 1689–1690 original edition, the "Division of the Sciences" chapter was Chapter XX. In the 4th ed. of 1700, a new Chapter XIX "Of Enthusiasm" is inserted into Book IV, after which the Chapter XX of the 1st ed. becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions.&amp;nbsp;— see in John Deely, ''Why Semiotics?'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2004), 71–88, esp. 77–80 for the editions of Locke's ''Essay'' from 1689 through 1716. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as "asides" in the writings of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Leibniz]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], "is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself. Even Locke's devoted late modern editor, [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]], dismisses out of hand 'this crude and superficial scheme of Locke'" (see "Locke's modest proposal subversive of the way of ideas, its reception, and its bearing on the resolution of an ancient and a modern controversy in logic" in Chap. 14 of Deely's ''Four Ages of Understanding'', pp. 591–606). In the 1975 Oxford University Press critical edition, prepared and introduced by Peter Harold Nidditch, Nidditch tells us, in his "Foreword", p. vii, that he presents us with "a complete, critically established, and unmodernized text that aims at being historically faithful to Locke's final intentions"; p. xxv tells us further that "the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the ''Essay''", and that "readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted, in appropriate form, where necessary, and recorded otherwise in the textual notes". The term "σημιωτική" appears in that 1700 4th edition, the last published (but not the last prepared) within Locke's lifetime, with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 1689/1690 1st edition. Yet if we turn to (the final) chapter XXI of the 1975 Oxford edition, we find on p. 720 not "σημιωτικὴ" but rather do we find substituted the "σημειωτικὴ" spelling (and with final accent reversed). (Note that in [[Greek orthography|Modern Greek]] and in [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching|some systems for pronouncing classical Greek]], "σημ'''ι'''ωτική" and "σημ'''ει'''ωτική" are pronounced the same.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Locke, the notion of "sign" as transcending the nature/culture divide was introduced by [[Augustine of Hippo]]—see John Deely, ''Augustine &amp; Poinsot: The Protosemiotic Development'' (Scranton: University of Scranton Press, 2009) for full details of Augustine's originality on this point—a specialized study was firmly established. Himself a man of [[medicine]], Locke was familiar with this "semeiotics" as naming a specialized branch within medical science. In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]' ''Thesaurus Graecae Linguae'', which listed σημειωτική as the name for "diagnostics", the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease ("[[symptomatology]]"). Indeed the English physician and scholar [[Henry Stubbes]] had transliterated this term of specialized science into English precisely as "semeiotic" in his 1670 work, ''The Plus Ultra Reduced to a Non Plus'' (p.&amp;nbsp;75).&lt;/ref&gt; Here he explains how science may be divided into three parts:

{{quote|All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or, secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into these three sorts.|Locke, 1823/1963, p. 174}}

Locke then elaborates on the nature of this third category, naming it Σημειωτική (''Semeiotike'') and explaining it as "the doctrine of signs" in the following terms:

{{quote|Nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick,&lt;ref&gt;A now-obsolete term for the art or profession of curing disease with (herbal) medicines or (chemical) drugs; especially [[purgative]]s or [[cathartic]]s. Also, it specifically refers to the treatment of humans.&lt;/ref&gt; but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology (founded on observation, not principles), semiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated,&lt;ref&gt;That is, "thought out", "contrived", or "devised" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; not commanding) medicines.|Locke, 1823/1963, 4.21.4, p. 175}}

In the nineteenth century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] defined what he termed "semiotic" (which he sometimes spelled as "semeiotic") as the "quasi-necessary, or formal doctrine of signs", which abstracts "what must be the characters of all signs used by&amp;nbsp;... an intelligence capable of learning by experience",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', vol. 2, paragraph 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "Logic, Considered as Semeiotic", Manuscript L75, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/l75.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway'', and, in particular, its "On the Definition of Logic" (Memoir 12), [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 transcription] at ''Arisbe''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), as opposed to the dyadic Saussurian tradition (signifier, signified), and is conceived of as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial, and sign processes, modes of inference, and the inquiry process in general, with emphases not only on symbols but also on signs that are semblances ("icons") and signs that are signs by being factually connected ("indices") to their objects.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peirce scholar and editor Max H. Fisch&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisch compiled Peirce-related bibliographical supplements in 1952, 1964, 1966, 1974; was consulting editor on the 1977 microfilm of Peirce's published works and on the ''Comprehensive Bibliography'' associated with it; was among the main editors of the first five volumes (published 1981–1993) ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce''; and wrote a number of published articles on Peirce, many collected in 1986 in ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Ketner and Kloesel, eds., Indiana University Press: [http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=19748 catalog page], Bloomington, IN, 480 pages. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1978&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max H. (1978), "Peirce's General Theory of Signs" in ''Sight, Sound, and Sense'', ed. T. A. Sebeok. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 31–70.&lt;/ref&gt; that "semeiotic" was Peirce's own preferred rendering of Locke's σημιωτική.

[[Charles W. Morris]] followed Peirce in using the term "semiotic" and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], however, founded his semiotics, which he called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], in the social sciences:

{{quote|It is... possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life. It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology. We shall call it semiology (from the Greek ''semeîon'', 'sign'). It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance. Linguistics is only one branch of this general science. The laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge. |Cited in [[Daniel Chandler|Chandler's]] "Semiotics for Beginners", Introduction.}}

While the Saussurean semiotic is dyadic (sign/syntax, signal/semantics), the Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial. The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but the internal representation machine, investigating not just sign processes, or modes of inference, but the whole inquiry process in general. Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types. For example, signs can be icons, indices, and symbols.

[[Yuri Lotman]] introduced Eastern Europe to semiotics and adopted Locke's coinage as the name to subtitle (''Σημειωτική'') his founding at the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]] in 1964 of the first semiotics journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]''.

[[Thomas Sebeok]] assimilated "semiology" to "semiotics" as a part to a whole,&lt;ref&gt;The whole anthology, ''Frontiers in Semiotics'', was devoted to the documentation of this ''pars pro toto'' move of Sebeok.&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in choosing the name ''Semiotica'' for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs.

Saussurean semiotics have been challenged with serious criticism, for example by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s assertion that signifier and signified are not fixed, coining the expression ''différance'', relating to the endless deferral of meaning, and to the absence of a 'transcendent signified'. For Derrida, 'il n'y a pas de hors-texte' ("there is nothing outside the text"). He was in obvious opposition to materialists and marxists who argued that a sign has to point towards a real meaning, and cannot be controlled by the referent's closed-loop references.

==History==

The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of [[philosophy]], and in psychology as well. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] both explored the relationship between signs and the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem02.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Signs|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Augustine considered the nature of the sign within a conventional system. These theories have had a lasting effect in [[Western philosophy]], especially through [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy. (More recently, Umberto Eco, in his ''[[Umberto Eco#Semiotics|Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language]]'', has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers.)

The general study of signs that began in Latin with Augustine culminated in Latin with the 1632 ''Tractatus de Signis'' of [[John Poinsot]], and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by Charles Sanders Peirce to draw up a "new list of categories". Peirce aimed to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs, in contrast with the list of Aristotle's categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such, through human understanding.

The estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a "meaningful world" of objects, but the objects of this world (or "Umwelt", in [[Jakob von Uexküll]]'s term,&lt;ref&gt;See "Umwelt", ''Semiotica'' 134–1/4 (2001), 125–135; Special Issue on "Jakob von Uexküll: A paradigm for biology and semiotics" Guest-Edited by Kalevi Kull.&lt;/ref&gt;) consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable (+), undesirable (–), or "safe to ignore" (0).

In contrast to this, human understanding adds to the animal "Umwelt" a relation of self-identity within objects which transforms objects experienced into ''things'' as well as +, –, 0 objects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Martin Heidegger]] (1927), in the 1962 trans. by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (New York, NY: Harper &amp; Row), p. 487: "The distinction between the being of existing Dasein and the Being of entities, such as Reality, which do not have the character of Dasein...is nothing with which philosophy may tranquilize itself. It has long been known that ancient ontology works with 'Thing-concepts' and that there is a danger of 'reifying consciousness'. But what does this 'reifying' signify? Where does it arise? Why does Being get 'conceived' 'proximally' in terms of the present-at-hand ''and not'' in terms of the ready-to-hand, which indeed lies ''closer'' to us? ''Why'' does reifying always keep coming back to exercise its dominion?" This is the question that the Umwelt/Lebenswelt distinction as here drawn answers to.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the generically animal objective world as "Umwelt", becomes a species-specifically human objective world or "Lebenswelt" (life-world), wherein linguistic communication, rooted in the biologically underdetermined "Innenwelt" (inner-world) of humans, makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of non-human animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity. This further point, that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication, but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animal's "Innenwelt", was originally clearly identified by Thomas A. Sebeok.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Sebeok, "The Evolution of Communication and the Origin of Language", lecture in the 1984 June 1–3 International Summer Institute for Semiotic and Structural Studies 1984 Colloquium on "Phylogeny and Ontogeny of Communication Systems", published under the title "Communication, Language, and Speech. Evolutionary Considerations", in Sebeok's ''I Think I Am A Verb. More Contributions to the Doctrine of Signs'' (New York: Plenum Press, 1986), pp. 10–16. For subsequent context, see the "Afterword" to the volume of Sebeok's ''Semiotic Prologues'', ed. John Deely and Marcel Danesi (Ottawa, Canada: Legas, 2012), pp. 365–383; version online at [http://www.augustoponzio.com/files/12._Deely.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Sebeok also played the central role in bringing Peirce's work to the center of the semiotic stage in the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Detailed demonstration of Sebeok's role of the global emergence of semiotics is recorded in at least three recent volumes. (1) ''Semiotics Seen Synchronically. The View from 2010'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2010). (2) ''Semiotics Continues To Astonish. Thomas A. Sebeok and the Doctrine of Signs'' (Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2011)—a 526-page assemblage of essays, vignettes, letters, pictures attesting to the depth and extent of Sebeok's promotion of semiotic understanding around the world, including his involvement with Juri Lotman and the Tartu University graduate program in semiotics (currently directed by P. Torop, M. Lotman and K. Kull). (3) Sebeok's ''Semiotic Prologues'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2012)—a volume which gathers together in Part I all the "prologues" (i.e., introductions, prefaces, forewords, etc.) that Sebeok wrote for other peoples' books, then in Part 2 all the "prologues" that other people wrote for Sebeok.&lt;/ref&gt; first with his expansion of the human use of signs ("anthroposemiosis") to include also the generically animal sign-usage ("zoösemiosis"),&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas A. Sebeok, "Communication in Animals and Men", review article covering three books: Martin Lindauer, ''Communication among Social Bees'' (Harvard Books in Biology, No. 2; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1961, pp. ix + 143); Winthrop N. Kellogg, Porpoises and Sonar (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1961, pp. xiv + 177); and John C. Lilly, ''Man and Dolphin'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday), in ''Language'' 39 (1963), 448–466.&lt;/ref&gt; then with his further expansion of semiosis (based initially on the work of Martin Krampen,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Krampen, "Phytosemiotics", ''Semiotica'', 36.3/4 (1981), 187–209.&lt;/ref&gt; but taking advantage of Peirce's point that an interpretant, as the third item within a sign relation, "need not be mental"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce c. 1907: Excerpt from "Pragmatism (Editor [3])", published under the title "A Survey of Pragmaticism" in ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', Vol. 5, ed. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1934), 5.473. See also the part of Peirce's letter of to Lady Welby dated 23 December 1908, in ''Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby'', ed. Charles S. Hardwick with the assistance of James Cook (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1977), pp. 73–86.

Peirce's distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter. The interpretant is the internal, mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign. The interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.logos.it/EN/2_18.html|title=LOGOS - Multilingual Translation Portal|website=courses.logos.it|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's "interpretant" notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life (study of "phytosemiosis" + "zoösemiosis" + "anthroposemiosis" = ''biosemiotics''), which was his first advance beyond Latin Age semiotics. Other early theorists in the field of semiotics include [[Charles W. Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;1971, orig. 1938, ''Writings on the general theory of signs'', Mouton, The Hague, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Black]] argued that the work of [[Bertrand Russell]] was seminal in the field.&lt;ref&gt;1944, Black M. ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', [[Library of Living Philosophers]], vol. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulations==
[[File:Kstovo-BusStation-Sinks-1444.JPG|thumb|[[Color code|Color-coding]] hot- and cold-water faucets (taps) is common in many cultures but, as this example shows, the coding may be rendered meaningless because of context. The two faucets (taps) probably were sold as a coded set, but the code is unusable (and ignored), as there is a single water supply.]]
Semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]). This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of [[code (semiotics)|codes]] that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear. To [[neologism|coin]] a word to refer to a ''thing'' (see [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] words), the [[community]] must agree on a simple meaning (a [[denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]). Codes also represent the [[value (semiotics)|values]] of the [[culture]], and are able to add new shades of [[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] to every aspect of life.

To explain the relationship between semiotics and [[communication studies]], [[communication]] is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and contexts to explain the [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[mechanics]] involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]], and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In ''Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics'', [[Marcel Danesi]] (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1987; trans. 1990: 16), who, as a [[musicology|musicologist]], considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.

Semiotics differs from [[linguistics]] in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality. Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense. Peirce's definition of the term "semiotic" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions. From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the [[philosophy of language]]. In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects. Different authors have called themselves "philosopher of language" or "semiotician". This difference does ''not'' match the separation between [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects. Philosophy of language pays more attention to [[natural language]]s or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification. Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the [[humanities]] (including [[literary theory]]) and to [[cultural anthropology]].

Semiosis or ''semeiosis'' is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]], [[John Deely]], and [[Umberto Eco]]. Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.

[[Cognitive semiotics]] may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] ([[Denmark]]), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established CCS (Center for Cognitive Semiotics) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

==Notable semioticians==
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), a [[History of logic|noted logician]] who founded philosophical [[pragmatism]], defined ''semiosis'' as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something, as an object, logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or ''interpretant'', itself a sign, thus leading to further interpretants.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of signs and semiosis, see under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/sign.html Sign]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semiosis.html Semiosis, semeiosy]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''; and "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of sign by C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]" collected by Robert Marty. Peirce's "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm What Is a Sign]" (MS 404 of 1894, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 4–10) provides intuitive help.&lt;/ref&gt; Semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself. The object may be quality, fact, rule, or even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]), and may be "immediate" to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or "dynamic", the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. The interpretant may be "immediate" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or "dynamic", such as a state of agitation; or "final" or "normal", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide.&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce, excerpt from a letter to William James, March 14, 1909, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraph 314. Also see under relevant entries in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''. On coincidence of actual opinion with final opinion, see MS 218, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/logic/ms218.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe'', and appearing in ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''semiotic''&lt;ref&gt;He spelt it "semiotic" and "semeiotic". See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semeiotic.html Semeiotic] [etc.] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities, and indices such as reactions. He came c.&amp;nbsp;1903&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 243–263, written c.&amp;nbsp;1903.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify any sign]] by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign.&lt;ref&gt;He worked on but did not perfect a finer-grained system of ten trichotomies, to be combined into 66 ([[Triangular number|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]]) classes of sign. That raised for Peirce 59,049 classificatory questions (59,049 = 3&lt;SUP&gt;10&lt;/SUP&gt;, or 3 to the 10th power). See p. 482 in "Excerpts from Letters to Lady Welby", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar. He regarded formal semiotic as logic ''per se'' and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics. In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of the term "sign" as:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea." Peirce called the sign a ''representamen'', in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that "represents" something else in order to suggest it (that is, "re-present" it) in some way.&lt;ref name="CREDO Reference"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|isbn=978-1-4051-8312-3|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/wileylitcul/semiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a summary of Peirce's contributions to semiotics, see Liszka (1996) or Atkin (2006).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913), the "father" of modern [[linguistics]], proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the ''signifier'' as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the ''signified'' as the mental concept. According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary—i.e., there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning. This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as [[Plato]] or the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies. In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', Saussure credits the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] (1827–1894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign. Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida, [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term ''sémiologie'' while teaching his landmark "Course on General Linguistics" at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1906 to 1911. Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a "signifier", i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the "signified", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued "sign". Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.
* [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944) studied the [[sign process]]es in animals. He used the German word for "environment", ''[[umwelt]]'', to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of [[functional circle]] (''funktionskreis'') as a general model of sign processes. In his ''Theory of Meaning'' (''Bedeutungslehre'', 1940), he described the semiotic approach to [[biology]], thus establishing the field that now is called [[biosemiotics]].
* [[Valentin Voloshinov]] (1895–1936) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Russian linguist, whose work has been influential in the field of [[literary theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ideology|theory of ideology]]. Written in the late 1920s in the USSR, Voloshinov's ''Marxism and the Philosophy of Language'' (tr.: Marksizm i Filosofiya Yazyka) developed a counter-Saussurean linguistics, which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontexualized Saussurean ''langue''.
* [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899–1965) developed a formalist approach to Saussure's structuralist theories. His best known work is ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', which was expanded in ''Résumé of the Theory of Language'', a formal development of ''glossematics'', his scientific calculus of language.
* [[Charles W. Morris]] (1901–1979). In his 1938 ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs'', he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches:
*# Semantics: relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their signified denotata, or meaning
*# Syntactics/Syntax: relations among or between signs in formal structures
*# Pragmatics: relation between signs and sign-using agents or interpreters
&lt;blockquote&gt;Syntactics is the Morris'ean branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols; the interrelation of the signs, without regard to meaning. Semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; the relation between the signs and the objects to which they apply. Finally, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs; the relation between the sign system and its human (or animal) user. Unlike his mentor [[George Herbert Mead]], Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the [[Vienna Circle]] [[positivism]] of his colleague, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Morris was accused by [[John Dewey]] of misreading Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2019493 |jstor=2019493 |title=Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=85 |year=1946 |last1=Dewey |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004), the "father" of modern [[psychosomatic medicine]], developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses.
* [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician. He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others. For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations. A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage—wine. However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making "wine" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes very much in line with similar Marxist theory.
[[File:Exemple de signalement visuel du statut social chez un Cichlidé.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signaling and communication between the ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'']]
* [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] (1917–1992) developed a structural version of semiotics named, "generative semiotics", trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification. His theories develop the ideas of Saussure, Hjelmslev, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].
* [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] (1920–2001), a student of Charles W. Morris, was a prolific and wide-ranging American semiotician. Although he insisted that animals are not capable of language, he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non-human signaling and communication systems, thus raising some of the issues addressed by [[philosophy of mind]] and coining the term [[zoosemiotics]]. Sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives. He also posed the equation between ''semiosis'' (the activity of interpreting signs) and ''life''—a view that the [[Copenhagen-Tartu biosemiotic school]] has further developed.
* [[Yuri Lotman]] (1922–1993) was the founding member of the [[Tartu]] (or Tartu-Moscow) [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School|Semiotic School]]. He developed a semiotic approach to the study of culture—[[semiotics of culture]]—and established a communication model for the study of text semiotics. He also introduced the concept of the [[semiosphere]]. Among his Moscow colleagues were [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Boris Uspensky]].
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] (1931–1993) pioneered the application of Saussurean semiotics to [[film theory]], applying [[syntagmatic analysis]] to scenes of films and grounding [[film semiotics]] in greater context.
* [[Eliseo Verón]] (1935–2014) developed his "Social Discourse Theory" inspired in the Peircian conception of "Semiosis".
* The Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of [[rhetorics]], and the [[visual semiotics]].
* [[Umberto Eco]] (1932–2016) was an [[Italy|Italian]] novelist, semiotician and academic. He made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications, most notably ''A Theory of Semiotics'' and his novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', which includes (second to its plot) applied semiotic operations. His most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation, encyclopedia, and model reader. He also criticized in several works (''A theory of semiotics'', ''La struttura assente'', ''Le signe'', ''La production de signes'') the "iconism" or "iconic signs" (taken from Peirce's most famous triadic relation, based on indexes, icons, and symbols), to which he proposed four modes of sign production: recognition, ostension, replica, and invention.
* [[Paul Bouissac]] (1934–) A world renowned expert of circus studies, Bouissac is known for developing a range of semiotic interpretations of circus performances. This includes the multimodal dimensions of clowns and clowning, jugglers, and trapeze acts. He is the author of several books relating to the semiotics of the circus. Bouissac is the Series Editor for the Advances in Semiotics Series for Bloomsbury Academic. He runs the SemiotiX Bulletin which has a global readership, is a founding editor of the Public Journal of Semiotics, and was a central founding figure in the Toronto Semiotic Circle. He is Professor Emeritus of Victoria College, University of Toronto. The personal, professional, and intellectual life of Bouissac is recounted in the book, ''[[The Pleasures of Time: Two Men, A Life]]'', by his life-long partner, the sociologist Stephen Harold Riggins.
*[[Julia Kristeva]] (1941–), a student of [[Lucien Goldmann]] and Roland Barthes, Bulgarian-French semiotician, [[literary critic]], [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[French feminist|feminist]], and [[novelist]]. She uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics, distinguishing the two components in the signification, the symbolic and the semiotic''.'' Kristeva also studies the representation of women and women's bodies in popular culture, such as [[Misogyny in horror films|slasher films]] and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies.

==Semiotics of dreaming==

The flexibility of human semiotics is well demonstrated in dreams. [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900) ''The Interpretation of Dreams.'' London: Hogarth&lt;/ref&gt; spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images, affects, sounds, words, and kinesthetic sensations. In his chapter on "The Means of Representation" he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations. Two images in sequence may indicate "if this, then that" or "despite this, that". Freud thought the dream started with "dream thoughts" which were like logical, verbal sentences. He believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer. In order to safeguard sleep, the mindbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form, through processes he called the "dream-work".

==Current applications==
[[File:Chart Semiotics of Social Networking.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chart [[semiotics of social networking]]]]
Applications of semiotics include:
*It represents a [[methodology]] for the analysis of "texts" regardless of [[modality (Semiotics)|the medium in which it is presented]]. For these purposes, "text" is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver;
*It may improve [[ergonomic]] design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments, whether it be on a large scale, as in [[architecture]], or on a small scale, such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use.

In some countries, its role is limited to [[literary criticism]] and an appreciation of audio and visual media. This narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture. Issues of technological [[determinism]] in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media.

Publication of research is both in dedicated journals such as ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', established by [[Yuri Lotman]] and published by [[Tartu University Press]]; ''[[Semiotica]]'', founded by [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]; ''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''; ''European Journal of Semiotics''; ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus]]'' (founded and directed by [[Umberto Eco]]), et al.; ''[[The American Journal of Semiotics]]''; and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines, especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism.

The major semiotic book series "Semiotics, Communication, Cognition", published by [[De Gruyter Mouton]] (series editors Paul Cobley and [[Kalevi Kull]]) replaces the former "Approaches to Semiotics" (more than 120 volumes) and "Approaches to Applied Semiotics" (series editor [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]). Since 1980 the [[Semiotic Society of America]] has produced an annual conference series: ''[[Semiotics: The Proceedings of the Semiotic Society of America]]''.

[[Marketing communications|Marketing]] is another application of semiotics. Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) said, "semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication" (p.&amp;nbsp;592).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epure |first1=M. |last2=Eisenstat |first2=E. |last3=Dinu |first3=C. |year=2014 |title=Semiotics And Persuasion In Marketing Communication |journal=Linguistic &amp; Philosophical Investigations |volume=13 |pages=592–605 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=30143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics are used in marketing as a [[Marketing strategy|persuasive device]] to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place. Two ways that Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) state that semiotics are used are:
# Surface: signs are used to create personality for the product; creativity plays its foremost role at this level.
# Underlying: the concealed meaning of the text, imagery, sounds, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semiotics analysis is used by scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created. Below is an example of how semiotic analysis is utilized in a research paper published in an academic journal: Educational Research and Reviews.

==Branches==
Semiotics has sprouted subfields including, but not limited to, the following:
* [[Biosemiotics]]: the study of semiotic processes at all levels of biology, or a semiotic study of living systems (e.g., [[Copenhagen–Tartu School]]).
* [[Semiotic anthropology]].
* [[Cognitive semiotics]]: the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] (Denmark), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established the Center for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.
* [[Computational semiotics]]: attempts to engineer the process of semiosis, in the study of and design for [[human-computer interaction]] or to mimic aspects of human [[cognition]] through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]]. See also [[cybercognition]].
* Cultural and [[Semiotic literary criticism|literary semiotics]]: examines the literary world, the visual media, the mass media, and advertising in the work of writers such as Roland Barthes, [[Marcel Danesi]], and [[Yuri Lotman]] (e.g., [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]]).
* [[Cybersemiotics]]: built on two already-generated interdisciplinary approaches: cybernetics and systems theory including [[information theory]] and science, and Peircean semiotics including phenomenology and pragmatic aspects of linguistics, attempts to make the two interdisciplinary paradigms—both going beyond mechanistic and pure constructivistic ideas—complement each other in a common framework.

* Design semiotics or product semiotics: the study of the use of signs in the design of physical products; introduced by [[Martin Krampen]], a o, and in a practitioner-oriented version by Rune Monö while teaching [[industrial design]] at the Institute of Design, [[Umeå University]], Sweden.
* Ethnosemiotics is a disciplinary perspective which links semiotics concepts to [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]].
* [[Film semiotics]]: the study of the various codes and signs of film and how they are understood; see [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]].
* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)|Gregorian chant semiology]] is a current avenue of [[palaeography|palaeographical]] research in [[Gregorian chant]] which is revising the [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] school of interpretation.
* Law and semiotics: one of the more accomplished publications in this field is the ''International Journal for the Semiotics of Law'', published by [[International Association for the Semiotics of Law]].
* Marketing semiotics, or commercial semiotics is an application of semiotic methods and semiotic thinking in the analysis and development of advertising and brand communications in cultural context. Key figures include [[Virginia Valentine]], Malcolm Evans, Greg Rowland, Georgios Rossolatos.
* [[Music semiology]]: "There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language." (Middleton 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;172) See Nattiez (1976, 1987, 1989), Stefani (1973, 1986), Baroni (1983), and ''Semiotica'' (66: 1–3 (1987)).
* [[Semiotics of music videos]].
* [[Organisational semiotics]]: the study of semiotic processes in organizations (with strong ties to [[computational semiotics]] and human-computer interaction).
* [[Social semiotics]]: expands the interpretable semiotic landscape to include all cultural codes, such as in [[slang]], fashion, tattoos, and advertising (See [[Roland Barthes]], [[Michael Halliday]], [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [[Chris William Martin (sociologist)|Chris William Martin]] and [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]]).
* [[Structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]] in the work of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]], etc.
* Theatre semiotics: extends or adapts semiotics onstage; key theoricians include Keir Elam.
* [[Urban semiotics]]
* [[Visual semiotics]]: analyses visual signs; prominent modern founders to this branch are [[Groupe µ]] and Göran Sonesson (see also [[visual rhetoric]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictorial concepts.

===Pictorial semiotics===
Pictorial semiotics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Semiotics|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326357|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intimately connected to art history and theory. It goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way, however. While [[art history]] has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as "works of art", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes. Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Codes|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326343?rskey=TyYRDS&amp;result=6|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Göran Sonesson, a Swedish semiotician, pictures can be analyzed by three models: (a) the narrative model, which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip; (b) the rhetoric model, which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor; and (c) the laokoon (or laocoon) model, which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonesson|first1=Göran|title=Methods and Models in Pictorial Semiotics|date=1988|pages=2–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from traditional art history and theory—as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis—leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics. Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.

One of the many ways that pictorial semiotics has been changing has been through the use of emojis in email, text or other online conversations. Though not seen as works of art, these small images of happy, sad, winking faces or even a smiling poo image, have made their way into our everyday communication through digital devices. In the early advances of mobile technology and the increasing manner in which such devices are used, many in the linguistic community felt that vital communication cues, such as the importance of nonverbal cues, would be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7575/aiac.alls.v.7n.6p.56 |title=Are Emojis Creating a New or Old Visual Language for New Generations? A Socio-semiotic Study |journal=Advances in Language and Literary Studies |volume=7 |issue=6 |year=2016 |pages=56–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that with the high use of these symbols would begin to oversimplify our language to where the language's strength would be lost.

However, others have said that the use of emojis in digital conversation has helped to give more clarity to a conversation. Since the ability to read another person's facial expressions, nonverbal cues or tone of voice isn’t possible in a typed message, emojis allow a communicator to convey attitudes and emotions to their message receiver. As for oversimplifying our language, some have argued that perhaps our language is not being simplified, but that new generations are revitalizing the early forms of semiotics like cave paintings or hieroglyphics. As technology advances, so will the use of emojis or possibly a more advanced form of pictorial symbols to use in digital communication.

===Globalization===
Studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a [[brand]]. [[Culture code]]s strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally. If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing. [[Globalization]] has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets.&lt;ref name="Alden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1252002 |jstor=1252002 |title=Brand Positioning Through Advertising in Asia, North America, and Europe: The Role of Global Consumer Culture |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=75 |year=1999 |last1=Alden |first1=Dana L |last2=Steenkamp |first2=Jan-Benedict E. M |last3=Batra |first3=Rajeev }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistranslations may lead to instances of "[[Engrish]]" or "[[Chinglish]]", terms for unintentionally humorous cross-cultural slogans intended to be understood in English. This may be caused by a sign that, in Peirce's terms, mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture, that it does not in another.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Daniel. (2001/2007). ''Semiotics: The Basics''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it creates a connotation that is culturally-bound, and that violates some culture code. Theorists who have studied humor (such as [[Schopenhauer]]) suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore, humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.1997.10673526 |title=Assessing the Use and Impact of Humor on Advertising Effectiveness: A Contingency Approach |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=17 |year=1997 |last1=Spotts |first1=Harlan E |last2=Weinberger |first2=Marc G |last3=Parsons |first3=Amy L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code. Intentional humor also may fail cross-culturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/540503 |jstor=540503 |title=Why Do They Laugh? An Interactional Approach to Humor in Traditional Iranian Improvisatory Theater: Performance and Its Effects |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=94 |issue=374 |pages=506 |year=1981 |last1=Beeman |first1=William O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of branding according to cultural code is [[Disney]]'s international [[theme park]] business. Disney fits well with [[Japan]]'s cultural code because the Japanese value "cuteness", politeness, and gift giving as part of their culture code; [[Tokyo Disneyland]] sells the most souvenirs of any Disney theme park. In contrast, [[Disneyland Paris]] failed when it launched as [[Euro Disney S.C.A.|Euro Disney]] because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture. Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as [[Elitism|elitist]] and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France. Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets. The park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of European culture in ways that were offensive.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5465/amr.2004.14497613 |jstor=20159073 |title=When Mickey Loses Face: Recontextualization, Semantic Fit, and the Semiotics of Foreignness |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=593–616 |year=2004 |last1=Brannen |first1=Mary Yoko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon, such as the [[Coca-Cola]] or [[McDonald's]] [[logo]]s, from one culture to another. This may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economically-developed to a less developed culture.&lt;ref name="Brannen" /&gt; The intentional association of a product with another culture has been called Foreign Consumer Culture Positioning (FCCP). Products also may be marketed using global trends or culture codes, for example, saving time in a busy world; but even these may be fine-tuned for specific cultures.&lt;ref name="Alden" /&gt;

Research also found that, as airline industry brandings grow and become more international, their logos become more symbolic and less iconic. The iconicity and symbolism of a sign depends on the cultural convention and, are on that ground in relation with each other. If the cultural convention has greater influence on the sign, the signs get more symbolic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1470357207081002 |title=National pride, global capital: A social semiotic analysis of transnational visual branding in the airline industry |journal=Visual Communication |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=305 |year=2016 |last1=Thurlow |first1=Crispin |last2=Aiello |first2=Giorgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangs and graffiti==

{{Tone|section|date=March 2018}}

Graffiti is used by gang members to mark their territory and to warn off rivals. Graffiti is a great example of semiotics and the use of symbols. Police task forces are now starting to use a programming system called GARI, they upload pictures of gang symbols that they find and it helps them to decipher the meaning of the symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadhazy |first1=Adam |date=September 27, 2012 |title=The Graffiti Code Breaker |journal=Discover |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=14 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2012/sep/25-the-graffiti-code-breaker }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members use semiotics and symbols for many different reasons, for example: Government-sanctioned graffiti from the city's Department of Public Works, in red, typically indicates an abandoned building, or the stylized SS stands for South Side, a faction of the 18th Street gang based in southern Indianapolis. A rival gang sprayed red Xs over the work as a sign of disrespect.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;Rollins, J. (2011). The lost boyz: a dark side of graffiti. Hook, Hampshire: Waterside Press.{{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Lost Boyz: A Dark Side of Graffiti'' by Justin Rollins&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; it talks about how Rollins started writing on trains at a very early age, because it helped him find himself, he was now a graffiti writer – a somebody.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This is true with a lot of symbols. People use symbols to express themselves by getting tattoos or wearing a symbol on their clothing. This helps them to feel like they belong to something or it helps them to express themselves. Gangs also use their clothing as a symbol, they do something unique for their group so that you aware of the gang you are encountering. An example could be a certain pant leg rolled up or wearing a certain color of bandana. The book also talks about how Rollins joined a graffiti gang that was called the WK which stands for Who Kares but it also had a different meaning which was Wanted Kriminals.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; Many symbols in semiotics theory have different meanings; these meanings can be different from country to country or even just from person to person depending on where and how a person was raised. For example, in the United States, waving is a form of "hello" but in other cultures this could mean something offensive.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Semiotics is anything that can stand for something else.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; A symbol does not stand on its own, it is a part of something, a system perhaps. Symbols in gangs are used for different things. Not just to show which gang a person is associated with but to express what has happened in their gang and in their individual lives. Gangs were first created to strengthen a certain ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Dowe&gt;Dowe, D. (2011). Gangs: Slang, Words, Symbols. Hendon Media Group, Law Enforcement Publications and Conferences. Retrieved from http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/article_archive/results/details?id=1402&lt;/ref&gt; They are very territorial. To show which territory is theirs they will mark the streets so that other gangs are aware. There are special ways to read gang signs and their tattoos: left to right, top to bottom. They may also make the tattoo or graffiti cluttered so that it is hard to read.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Each gang has special hand signals or set of signs to identify themselves. There are some gangs who add a dot or something similar to their graffiti to stand as a phrase used in their specific gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; Each gang is unique and has special symbols, and these symbols usually have some sort of meaning. For example, the gang called "Bloods" use the color red in their clothing to symbolize they are a part of this specific gang. They also are known to use the number 5 and have tattoos and graffiti of a five-point crown. The hand sign that they use mostly is a "b" which stands for bloods.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Some gangs use graffiti and tattoos more than others as well as using their clothing as a symbol of their gang. Gangs will also use codes to communicate on the streets. They will oftentimes use a number that will relate to a letter of the alphabet. Depending on the gang, they may use more complex codes.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Street gangs are known for using graffiti in their neighborhoods to mark their territory. Gangs are also using their graffiti to challenge other gangs and to disrespect them.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; When they do this, they will somehow cross the other gang's symbol, and they will use their gang slang as well. They make sure to do it in a place that is clear and will leave a direct hit on the other gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Semiotics and gang graffiti merge on the undercarriage of bridges, the face of billboards, on abandoned buildings, storefronts, the sides of railroad cars, and even in inconspicuous places found along dirt roads in small rural areas. The idea, is to communicate a message. A message that is part of a system.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |year=2014 |edition=9th |chapter=Semiotics |first1=Roland |last1=Barthes |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |pages=327–38 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-784245-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not uncommon for those outside the culture of gangs to judge the meaning of graffiti and its direct connection to semiotics as completely negative. This kind of graffiti was branded "Graffiti of Grief" in an article by Gabrielle Luber.&lt;ref name="Lübbers"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=40341950 |last1=Lübbers |first1=Gabriele |year=2007 |title=The Graffiti of Grief: Violence, Death and Remembrance in Pittsburgh Gang Neighbourhoods |journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde |volume=53 |pages=145–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a commemoration of mourning; a "funeral" for those who have died on the streets. The murals are often created by
members designated within the gang and the artwork is intended "provide glimpses of their lives, possessions, friends, and surroundings, and map out for us the identities of lost friends."&lt;ref name="Lübbers"/&gt; The symbols used in these murals are intentional and communicate significant meanings within the developed culture. It is an art, an expression of respect and loyalty. It is a portable headstone and is often layered (painted over) with the next memorial of death caused by street violence. In its own right, it is a historical timeline, a genealogy of grief, and it is rewritten every day with the same story and a new name. Poverty, marginalism, survival, perpetual crisis, inadequate housing, low or no job skills, poor education, and social constraints and constructs will continue to market for the consumption of lives on the streets. The symbol of grief portrayed in certain kinds of graffiti suggest a depth of meaning and a place or memorial far beyond what the eye can see. To an outsider, it may easily be interpreted without compassion.

==Main institutions==

A world organisation of semioticians, the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]], and its journal ''[[Semiotica]]'', was established in 1969. The larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the [[University of Tartu]], [[Aarhus University]], and [[Bologna University]].

==In popular culture==
The discipline is mentioned in an episode of [[The Big Bang Theory]] called [[The Hamburger Postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.psu.edu/kalelkarcas402/2015/09/14/semiotics/{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{self-published inline|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stimulation triggers rhythmic, involuntary contractions in smooth muscle in the male reproductive tract, especially the vas deferens and the prostate.

&lt;!-- NOTE: This section was titled "Etymology and definitions," but as the etymology material is defining sexual intercourse, and there is little material on the etymology, it seemed there was no need to separate it from the other definitions; the heading was subsequently shortened to "Definitions" and added as a subsection of the Behaviors section (since it involves general views, and researchers' views, on sexual intercourse/sexual activity definitions and how people behave with regard to them). Per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading."--&gt;

''Sexual intercourse'' may be called ''coitus'', ''copulation'', ''coition'', or ''intercourse'' (the last of which is typically shorthand for ''sexual intercourse''). ''Coitus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coitio'' or ''coire'', meaning "a coming together or joining together" or "to go together", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile–vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name="Coitus"&gt;

===Bonding===
{{See also|Human mating strategies|Pair bond}}
Copulation ranges from a purely reproductive activity to one of emotional bonding. For example, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general often play a strong role in [[human bonding]].&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of [[birth control]] (contraception), sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

In humans and [[bonobo]]s, the female undergoes relatively [[concealed ovulation]] so that male and female partners commonly do not know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One possible reason for this distinct biological feature may be formation of strong emotional bonds between sexual partners important for social interactions and, in the case of humans, long-term partnership rather than immediate sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Harry T.

The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt;

===Stimulation===
Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity can encompass various [[sexually stimulating]] factors ([[Stimulus (physiology)|physiological stimulation]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]]), including different [[sex position]]s or the use of [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taormino |first=Tristan |authorlink=Tristan Taormino |title=The Big Book of Sex Toys|publisher=Quiver|year=2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2014|page=52|isbn=978-1-59233-355-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfly-iMkWRkC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to [[sexual arousal]] of the partners and resulting in the erection of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] of the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011|pages=384–386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT421 |author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S.

In most mammals, the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation. Copulation corresponds to a succession of [[Instinct|innate]] sexual reflexes: [[erection]], vaginal lubrication, [[lordosis behavior]], immobilization, intromission, [[pelvic thrust]] and [[ejaculation]]. These copulatory [[Reflex arc|reflexes]] are controlled by [[hormone]]s and facilitated by sexual [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Plant"&gt;Plant T., Zeleznik A. (2015).

Fingering (or digital penetration or digital intercourse) involves the manual manipulation of the clitoris, rest of the [[vulva]], vagina or anus for the purpose of sexual arousal and sexual stimulation; it may constitute the entire sexual encounter or it may be part of mutual masturbation, foreplay or other sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Kinetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hite"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|author-link=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2003|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=1-58322-569-2|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book | title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2009 | pages = 118, 252, and 264 | accessdate =June 23, 2012 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118|isbn =978-0-495-60274-3| first = Janell L. | last = Carroll}}

The subsequent route of the sperm from the vault of the vagina is through the [[cervix]] and into the [[uterus]], and then into the [[fallopian tube]]s. Millions of sperm are present in each ejaculation, to increase the chances of one fertilizing an egg or [[ovum]] (see [[sperm competition]]). When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete joins with the ovum, resulting in [[fertilisation|fertilization]] and the formation of a new [[embryo]]. When a fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, it becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus (the [[endometrium]]) and a [[pregnancy]] begins.&lt;ref name="Evan Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr3"&gt;{{cite book| author = Cecie Starr|author2= Beverly McMillan|title = Human Biology| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2015 | page = 339| accessdate = December 27, 2017 |isbn = 1305445945| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lS5-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It said that women engage in anal intercourse less commonly than men, but that the practice is not uncommon among women; it was estimated that 10% to 14% of women aged 18 to 39 years old practiced anal sex in the past 90 days, and that most of the women said they practiced it once a month or a few times a year.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

===={{anchor|sexarche}}Age at first intercourse====
The prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally. In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] conducted a cross-cultural study titled "At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (listing [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, though data was only available from [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bozon |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women; this group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] (Portugal, Greece and Romania are noted) and from [[Latin America]] (Brazil, [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched; there were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries (Poland and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered China and Vietnam to also fall into this group, though data were not available.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt; In northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual intercourse before any union formation; the study listed Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic as members of this group.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[Parasitism|parasites]], which are passed from person to person during sexual contact, especially penetrative sexual intercourse. Some, in particular [[HIV]] and syphilis, can also be passed in other ways, including from mother to child during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], through [[blood product]]s, and by shared [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|publisher=World Health Organization

Untreated chlamydia infection can lead to female infertility and [[ectopic pregnancy]]. [[Human papillomavirus]] can lead to genital and [[cervical cancer]]s. [[Syphilis]] can result in [[stillbirth]]s and neonatal deaths. Untreated gonococcal infections result in [[miscarriage]]s, [[preterm birth]]s and [[Perinatal mortality|perinatal deaths]]. Infants born to mothers with untreated [[gonorrhea]] or chlamydia can develop [[neonatal conjunctivitis]] (a serious eye infection), which can lead to blindness.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"/&gt; [[Hepatitis B]] can also be transmitted through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm#treatment CDC Hepatitis B Information for Health Professionals] Accessed May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are about 350 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index1.html|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where infection is suspected, early medical intervention is highly beneficial in all cases. The CDC stated "the risk of HIV transmission from an infected partner through oral sex is much less than the risk of HIV transmission from anal or vaginal sex," but that "measuring the exact risk of HIV transmission as a result of oral sex is very difficult" and that this is "because most sexually active individuals practice oral sex in addition to other forms of sex, such as vaginal and/or anal sex, when transmission occurs, it is difficult to determine whether or not it occurred as a result of oral sex or other more risky sexual activities". They added that "several co-factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex"; this includes ulcers, [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]], genital sores, and the presence of other STIs.&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt;

In 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 123 million women become pregnant worldwide each year, and around 87 million of those pregnancies or 70.7% are unintentional.

In 1991, scholars from the Kinsey Institute stated, "The truth is that the time between penetration and ejaculation varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man." They added that the appropriate length for sexual intercourse is the length of time it takes for both partners to be mutually satisfied, emphasizing that [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] "found that 75 percent of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration. But he didn't ask if the men or their partners considered two minutes mutually satisfying" and "more recent research reports slightly longer times for intercourse".&lt;ref name="Reinisch"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Kinsey Institute New Report On Sex| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1991 | pages = 129–130| accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0312063865| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KsW6wPiXEd0C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129 |author1=June M.

[[Vaginismus]] is involuntary tensing of the pelvic floor musculature, making coitus, or any form of penetration of the vagina, distressing, painful and sometimes impossible for women. It is a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, and is sometimes referred to as the ''PC muscle.''

Sexual intercourse remains possible after major medical treatment of the reproductive organs and structures. This is especially true for women. Even after extensive gynecological surgical procedures (such as [[hysterectomy]], [[oophorectomy]], [[salpingectomy]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[hymenotomy]], [[Bartholin gland]] surgery, abscess removal, [[vestibulectomy]], [[labia minora]] reduction, [[cervical conization]], [[Surgery|surgical]] and radiological cancer treatments and chemotherapy), coitus can continue. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | edition = 2nd | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical |page=65 |location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 0071716726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--pages 1020-1348--&gt;

===Disabilities and other complications===
{{main| Sexuality and disability}}

Obstacles that those with [[disabilities]] face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], fatigue, [[negative body image]], stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced [[libido]], hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects. Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Tristano2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tristano|first1=Antonio G|title=Impact of rheumatoid arthritis on sexual function|journal=World Journal of Orthopedics|volume=5|issue=2|year=2014|page=107|issn=2218-5836|doi=10.5312/wjo.v5.i2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult.&lt;ref name="DeyoVon Korff2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deyo|first1=R.

The [[mentally disabled]] also are subject to challenges in participating in sexual intercourse. Women with Intellectual disabilities (ID) are often presented with situations that prevent sexual intercourse. This can include the lack of a knowledgeable healthcare provider trained and experienced in counseling those with ID on sexual intercourse.  Those with ID may have hesitations regarding the discussion of the topic of sex, a lack of sexual knowledge and limited opportunities for sex education.  In addition there are other barriers such as a higher prevalence of sexual abuse and assault.  These crimes often remain underreported.  There remains a lack of "dialogue around this population's human right to consensual sexual expression, undertreatment of menstrual disorders, and legal and systemic barriers". Women with ID may lack sexual health care and sex education.  They may not recognize sexual abuse. Consensual sexual intercourse is not always an option for some.  Those with ID may have limited knowledge and access to contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="GreenwoodWilkinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Nechama W.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Joanne|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health Care for Women with Intellectual Disabilities: A Primary Care Perspective|journal=International Journal of Family Medicine|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–8|issn=2090-2042|doi=10.1155/2013/642472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social effects==

===Adults===
Some researchers, such as [[Alex Comfort]], posit three potential advantages or social effects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive; these are reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comfort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Alex|authorlink = Alex Comfort|title = The New Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking | publisher = Diane Publishing Company | year = 1991 | pages = 253 pages| accessdate = August 16, 2013 |isbn = 0756783526| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nfijPQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the development of the birth control pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid to late 20th century increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, they still significantly overlap and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have sexual intercourse while contracepting not only to experience sexual pleasure (recreational), but also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This couple may emphasize different aspects of sexual intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of sexual intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).&lt;ref name="Comfort"/&gt;

[[Sexual dissatisfaction]] due to the lack of sexual intercourse is associated with increased risk of [[divorce]] and relationship dissolution, especially for men.&lt;ref name="Munck"&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor C.

For women, there is often a complaint about the lack of their spouses' sexual spontaneity. Decreased sexual activity among these women may be the result of their perceived failure to maintain ideal [[physical attractiveness]] or because their sexual partners' health issues have hindered sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Montemurro"&gt;{{cite book| author = Beth Montemurro|title =Deserving Desire: Women's Stories of Sexual Evolution|publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] | year = 2014 | page = 169 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 0813573068| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1XVYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.&lt;ref name="Wincze"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurian"&gt;{{cite book| author = Michael Gurian|title =The Wonder of Aging: A New Approach to Embracing Life After Fifty|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2013 | page = 178 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 1476706719| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XyS5ebuXJWgC&amp;pg=PT178}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to divorce, women are more likely to divorce their spouses for a [[one-night stand]] or various infidelities if they are in less cooperative or high-conflict marriages.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

Research additionally indicates that non-married couples who are [[cohabiting]] engage in sexual intercourse more often than married couples, and are more likely to participate in sexual activity outside of their sexual relationships; this may be due to the "[[honeymoon]]" effect (the newness or novelty of sexual intercourse with the partner), since sexual intercourse is usually practiced less the longer a couple is married, with couples engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity once or twice a week, or approximately six to seven times a month.&lt;ref name="Strong2"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bryan Strong| author2 = Theodore Cohen|title =The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society|publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2013 | page = 212 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn =1285531892| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in older age]] also affects the frequency of sexual intercourse, as older people generally engage in sexual intercourse less frequently than younger people do.&lt;ref name="Strong2"/&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
Adolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives. For example, while [[teenage pregnancy]] may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the [[Precocious puberty|earlier onset of puberty]] for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready.&lt;ref name="sex lives3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers| isbn=978-0-452-28260-5| last=Ponton| first=Lynn|authorlink=Lynn Ponton| year=2000| page=3| publisher=[[Dutton Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom),&lt;ref name="DiClemente"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ralph J.

Some studies from the 1970s through 1990s suggested an association between [[self-esteem]] and sexual intercourse among adolescents,&lt;ref name="Lerner 2"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Richard M. | last1 = Lerner | first2 = Daniel F. | last2 = Perkins | name-list-format = vanc |title = Social Interactions in Adolescence and Promoting Positive Social Contributions of Youth| publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 1999 | page = 124| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 0815332955| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BunEIQylaJAC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies, from the 1980s and 1990s, reported that the research generally indicates little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name=" Kowalski"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kowalski RM, Leary MR |title =The Interface of Social and Clinical Psychology: Key Readings| publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | year = 2004 | page = 121| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 1841690872| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qkEdaQ4heGgC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the evidence mostly supported the latter,&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt; and further research has supported little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name="Guindon"&gt;{{cite book| author =Mary H.

Psychiatrist [[Lynn Ponton]] wrote, "All adolescents have sex lives, whether they are sexually active with others, with themselves, or seemingly not at all", and that viewing adolescent sexuality as a potentially positive experience, rather than as something inherently dangerous, may help young people develop healthier patterns and make more positive choices regarding sexual activity.&lt;ref name="sex lives3" /&gt; Researchers state that long-term romantic relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen S., Collins W.

While sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to [[religion and sexuality|religious]] and governmental laws. Some governments and religions also have strict designations of "appropriate" and "inappropriate" sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridge Jr. Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861–2003.

Most countries have [[age of consent]] laws which set the minimum legal age with whom an older person may engage in sexual intercourse, usually set at 16 to 18, but ranges from 12 to 20, years of age. In some societies, an age of consent is set by non-statutory custom or tradition.&lt;ref name="Kinnear"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen L.

Kalbfleisch and Michael J. Cody stated that this made it so that if "sex means penile-vaginal intercourse, then rape means forced penile-vaginal intercourse, and other sexual behaviors&amp;nbsp;– such as fondling a person's genitals without her or his consent, forced oral sex, and same-sex coercion&amp;nbsp;– are not considered rape"; they stated that "although some other forms of forced sexual contact are included within the legal category of sodomy (e.g., anal penetration and oral-genital contact), many unwanted sexual contacts have no legal grounding as rape in some states".&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"/&gt; Ken Plumber argued that the legal meaning "of rape in most countries is unlawful sexual intercourse which means the penis must penetrate the vagina" and that "other forms of sexual violence towards women such as forced oral sex or anal intercourse, or the insertion of other objects into the vagina, constitute the 'less serious' crime of sexual assault".&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt;

Over time, the meaning of rape broadened in some parts of the world to include many types of sexual penetration, including anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and penetration of the genitals or rectum by an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) still considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed the meaning from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The meaning does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level, but instead assures that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=U.S. to Expand Rape Definition in Crime Statistics (New York Times, January 6, 2012)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, penetration is not required for the act to be categorized as rape.&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most societies around the world, the concept of [[incest]] exists and is criminalized. James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology at [[Monash University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee(896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0).html|title=Dr James Roffee|publisher=Monash university|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204003059/http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee%28896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0%29.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed potential harm associated with familial sexual activity, such as resulting children born with deficiencies. However, the law is more concerned with protecting the rights of people who are potentially subjected to such abuse. This is why familial sexual relationships are criminalized, even if all parties are consensual. There are laws prohibiting all kinds of sexual activity between relatives, not necessarily penetrative sex. These laws refer to grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts and uncles. There are differences between states in terms of the severity of punishments and what they consider to be a relative, including biological parents, step-parents, adoptive parents and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J.

====Marriage and relationships====
Sexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring [[consummation]] of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation).&lt;!-- NOTE: This is also sourced in the bullet-point examples list below.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite book| author =Margaret Monahan Hogan|title =Marriage as a Relationship: Real and Rational|publisher = [[Marquette University Press]] | year = 2002 | page = 88 | accessdate = September 1, 2015 |isbn = 0874626579| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HuztAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Marriage+as+a+Relationship:+Real+and+Rational}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for [[annulment]] (which does not require a divorce process). Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a "marital right" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;{{cite book| author =James G.

[[Adultery]] (engaging in sexual intercourse with someone other than one's spouse) has been, and remains, a criminal offense in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Brundage"&gt;{{cite book| author =James A.

Dwyer stated that no-fault divorce laws "have made it much easier for a woman to exit a marital relationship, and wives have obtained greater control over their bodies while in a marriage" because of legislative and judicial changes regarding the concept of a marital exemption when a man rapes his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"/&gt;

There are various legal positions regarding the meaning and legality of sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case [[Blanchflower v. Blanchflower]], it was held that female same-sex sexual relations, and same-sex sexual practices in general, did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 entry in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' that categorizes sexual intercourse as coitus; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="GLAD, B vs. B"&gt;{{cite web| title=Blanchflower v.

* In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or [[Mormonism]], sexual relations within the bonds of matrimony are seen as sacred.

In Shi'ia Islam, men are allowed to enter into an unlimited number of temporary marriages, which are contracted to last for a period of minutes to multiple years and permit sexual intercourse. Sunni women are allowed to enter only one marriage permanently at a time whereas Shi'ia women both temporary or permanent. 
* [[Hinduism]] has varied views about sexuality, but Hindu society, in general, perceives [[extramarital sex]] to be immoral and shameful.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;Don S.

* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ethics, in its most general formulation, holds that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure since it binds one to the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and prevents one attaining the goal of [[Nirvana]]. Since Buddhist monastics (i.e. [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s) are to be fully dedicated towards this goal, they undertake the training rule of total abstinence from sexual intercourse, i.e. of celibacy. Other monastic training rules from the Code of Discipline ([[Patimokkha]] or Pratimoksasutra) and canonical [[Vinaya]] scriptures are to prevent masturbation, lustfully touching and speaking to members of the other sex, and other forms of sexual behaviour. Buddhist lay people undertake the [[Five Precepts]], the third of which is avoiding sexual misconduct. Peter Harvey says that this precept "relates primarily to the avoidance of causing suffering by one's sexual behaviour. Adultery—'going with the wife of another'—is the most straightforward breach of this precept. The wrongness of this is seen as partly in terms of its being an expression of greed, and partly in terms of its harm to others. It is said that a man breaks the precept if he has intercourse with women who are engaged, or who are still protected by any relative, or young girls not protected by a relative, Clearly, rape and incest are breaches of the precept."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''. Cambridge, 2000: 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Canonical scriptures contain no other regulations or recommendations for lay people—for example, with regards homosexuality, masturbation, sexual practices and contraceptives. However, in keeping with the Buddhist ethical principles of not-harming and avoiding shame, guilt and remorse, socially taboo forms of sexuality as well as obsessive sexual activities can also be seen as being included in the third precept. Later Buddhist authors such as [[Nagarjuna]] give various clarifications and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''.

In some cases, the sexual intercourse between two people is seen as counter to religious law or doctrine.

In [[zoology]], ''copulation'' often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"/&gt; [[Spider]]s have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can store sperm indefinitely.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate vaginally, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630–631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

For primitive [[insect]]s, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

Bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins are species known to engage in heterosexual behaviors even when the female is not in estrus, which is a point in her reproductive cycle suitable for successful impregnation. These species are also known to [[Homosexual behavior in animals|engage in same-sex sexual behaviors]].&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt; In these animals, the use of sexual intercourse has evolved beyond reproduction&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt; to apparently serve additional social functions (such as bonding).&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
'''Taoist sexual practices''' ({{lang-zh|s=房中术|t=房中術|p=fángzhōngshù}}), literally "the bedroom arts", are the ways [[Taoism|Taoists]] may practice [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  These practices are also known as "Joining Energy" or "The Joining of the Essences".  Practitioners believe that by performing these sexual arts, one can stay in good health, and attain longevity or spiritual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/heart-and-soul-healing/201210/tantric-and-taoist-practices-improve-sex|title=Tantric and Taoist Practices to Improve Sex|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr STEVEN LIU and JONATHAN BLANK SECRETS OF DRAGON GATE 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreattao.com/html/taoofsexology.html|title=Tao of Sexology: Sexual Wisdom and Methods|website=www.thegreattao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some Taoist sects during the [[Han dynasty]] performed [[sexual intercourse]] as a spiritual practice, called "Héqì" (合氣], "Joining Energy"){{cn|date=October 2018}}. The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}. While [[Taoism]] had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts shared some remarkable similarities with later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishinpō|Ishinpō (醫心方)]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their climax between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty{{cn|date=October 2018}}. 

After 1000 AD, [[Confucian]] restraining attitudes towards sexuality became stronger, so that by the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644, sex was a [[taboo]] topic in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. These Confucians alleged that the separation of genders in most social activities existed 2,000 years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the [[taboo]] surrounding sex, there was much [[censorship|censoring]] done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts disappeared in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. As a result, some of the [[Document|texts]] survived only in [[Japan]], and most scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in [[History of China|early China]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Gulik (1961), preface&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval practices==

===Qi (lifeforce) and jing (essence)===
The basis of all Taoist thinking is that [[qi| qi (氣)]] is part of everything in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Qi is related to another energetic substance contained in the human body known as [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], and once all this has been expended the body dies. Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents.  The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male control of ejaculation===
Many [[Taoist]] practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force: where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  While some Taoists contend that one should never ejaculate, others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculation]]s in order to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  As these sexual practices were passed down over the [[centuries]], some practitioners have given less importance to the limiting of ejaculation.  Nevertheless, the "retention of the [[semen]]" is one of the foundational tenets of Taoist sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Taoists. In order to avoid [[ejaculation]], the man could do one of several things. He could pull out immediately before [[orgasm]], a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed "coitus conservatus".&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1983), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; A second method involved the man applying pressure on the [[perineum]], thus retaining the sperm. While, if done incorrectly can cause a [[retrograde ejaculation]], the Taoists believed that the jing traveled up into the head and "nourished the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jing===
Another important concept of "The Joining of the Essences" was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovemaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"/&gt;

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang]] is important in Taoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male sex, whereas Yin could refer to the female sex. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore, while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. Taoist texts described a large number of special sexual positions that served to cure or prevent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

For Taoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man{{cn|date=October 2018}}. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the [[Ishinpō]], with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

Women were often given a position of inferiority in sexual practice{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Many of the texts{{which|date=October 2018}} discuss sex from a male point of view, and avoid discussing how sex could benefit women. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised to have sex only with the woman who was beautiful and not yet produced children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At numerous points during the Ishinpō, the woman is referred to as the "enemy"; this was because the woman could cause him to spill semen and lose vitality. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the "other," "crucible", or "stove" from which to cultivate vitality.  The importance of pleasing the woman was also diminished in later texts.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was known as ([[:zh:采阴补阳|Caibu (採補)]]), as a man enters many women without ejaculation.

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend men's lives{{cn}. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated explanation of how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was extended only through the absorption of the woman's vital energies (jing and qi). Some Taoists called the act of sex “The battle of stealing and strengthening.”&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These sexual methods could be correlated with Taoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy's resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===When and where===

Another text, ''Health Benefits of the Bedchamber''{{cn|date=October 2018}}, indicates that certain times were better for [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] than others. A person had to avoid having [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] on [[Quarter moon|quarter]] or [[full moon]]s and on [[days]] when there were great [[winds]], [[rain]], [[fog]], [[cold]] or [[heat]], [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[darkness]] over [[heaven and earth]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, [[solar eclipses|solar]] and [[lunar eclipses]], [[rainbow]]s and [[earthquake]]s. Having intercourse at these times would harm a [[man]]'s spirit and would cause [[women]] to become [[illness|ill]]. [[Children]] [[Fertilisation|conceived]] at these times would be [[wikt:mad|mad]], [[stupid]], [[perverse]] or [[wikt:foolish|foolish]]; [[Muteness|mute]], [[deaf]], [[crippled]] or [[Visual impairment|blind]]; [[Filial piety|unfilial]] and [[violent]]{{dubious|date=October 2018}}.

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman's [[menstrual period|period]], the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] after [[midnight]], the child would likely be male. If a female child was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's [[menstrual period|period]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

The location of [[sex|sexual intercourse]] was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the [[sun]], [[moon]] or [[stars]], the interior of [[shrines]], proximity to [[temples]], [[Water well|wells]], [[stoves]] and [[wikt:privy|privies]], and the vicinity of [[grave]]s or [[coffin]]s{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

If these suggestions were followed "the family's offspring would be [[good]], wise and [[virtuous]]". If they were not followed, "the [[offspring]] would be [[evil]] and the [[family]] would eventually die off".&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and immortality===
Some [[Ming dynasty]] Taoist [[sect]]s believed that one way for men to achieve longevity or 'towards immortality' is by having intercourse with [[virgin]]s, particularly young virgins. Taoist sexual books, such as the ''Hsuan wei Hshin'' ("Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques") and ''San Feng Tan Cheueh'' ("Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy"), written, respectively, by Zhao Liangpi and Zhang Sanfeng (not to be confused with semi-mythical [[Zhang Sanfeng]] who lived in an earlier period), call the woman sexual partner ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' ([[wiktionary:鼎|鼎]]) and recommend sex with [[menarche|premenarche]] virgins. Zhao Liangpi concludes that the ideal ''ding'' is a premenarche virgin just under 14 years of age and women older than 18 should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques |first1=Zhao |last1=Lianpi |first2=Hsuan Wei |last2=Hshin}} (published before 1850)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Sanfeng went further and divided ''ding'' into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old [[Menstruation|menstruating]] virgins; the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XyChBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |author-link=Ruan Fangfu |first=Fang Fu |last=Ruan |editor-first=Molleen |editor-last=Matsumura |title=Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture |date=31 October 1991 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |chapter=The Value of Virgins as Sex Partners |page=56 |quote=Almost all Taoist sex handbooks recommend that the "ding" should be a girl of 14 to 16, just before or after menarch. In Zhang '''Sanfeng''''s Instructions in Physiological Alchemy, "ding" were classified into three ranks. The lowest rank comprised women between the ages of 21 and 25. The middle rank compromised 16- to 20-year-old virgins after menarch. The highest rank comprised 14-year-old virgins before menarch.}} ("The Role of Sexual Lore in Taoism" begins on page 50, this is a 2013 edition of a 1991 book)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM#b1-TAOISM%20AND%20SEX |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021216190909/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM |archive-date=16 December 2002 |title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia |section=Taoism and Sex |quote=The Taoist sexual books, such as the Hsuan wei Hshin (Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques') and San Feng Tan Cheueh (Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy), written, respectively, by Zhao '''Liang Pi''' and Zhang '''San Feng''', state that the most desirable ding is a girl about 14, 15, or 16 years old just before or after menarche. Zhang '''Sanfeng''' went further and divided ding into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old menstruating virgin girls; and the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgin girls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ge Hong]], a 4th-century Taoist [[alchemy|alchemist]], "those seeking 'immortality' must perfect the absolute essentials. These consist of treasuring the jing, circulating the qi and consuming the great medicine."&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual arts concerned the first precept, treasuring the jing. This is partially because treasuring the jing involved sending it up into the brain. In order to send the jing into the brain, the male had to refrain from ejaculation during sex. According to some Taoists, if this was done, the jing would travel up the spine and nourish the brain instead of leaving the body. Ge Hong also states, however, that it is folly to believe that performing the sexual arts only can achieve immortality and some of the ancient myths on sexual arts had been misinterpreted and exaggerated. Indeed, the sexual arts had to be practiced alongside [[alchemy]] to attain longevity. Ge Hong also warned it could be dangerous if practiced incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"/&gt;

==History==

The Mars Generation was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old [[Abigail Harrison]], popularly known as "Astronaut Abby" and has the support of high-level advisory board members which includes astronauts, engineers and scientists as well as [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[education]] and [[business]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/30544-astronaut-abby-launches-mars-generation.html|title=Launching 'The Mars Generation': Teen on Mission to Get People to Mars|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison started [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and space advocacy work at the age of 13 by initially setting up a [[Twitter]] account under her childhood nickname "Astronaut Abby."  She used her @AstronautAbby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstronautAbby|title=Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter account to connect with [[NASA]] employees to try and procure a quote for her National History Day project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her account biography stated that she was aspiring to be an astronaut and had a goal to be the first person to set foot on Mars. After she received the NASA quote, she began to share her journey to Mars which included tweets about space events, school and her personal life with the goal of not only exciting people about mars exploration but creating advocates for human space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, at 15-years old, Harrison partnered with her mentor, Astronaut [[Luca Parmitano]] as his [[Earth]] Liaison and shared his experience living in space on the [[International Space Station]] during [[Expedition 36]] and [[Expedition 37]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/101824/why-an-astronaut-asked-15-year-old-abby-to-help-get-the-word-out/#more-101824|title=Why An Astronaut Asked 15 Year Old Abby to Help Get The Word Out – Universe Today|date=2013-04-30|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harrison setup an international outreach program consisting of classroom web chats, an [[email]] [[pen pal]] program, [[classroom]] visits, blogging on AstronautAbby.com, writing for other publications, speaking at events, and sharing on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorecuriocity.org/Explore/ArticleId/2326/astronaut-abby-2326.aspx|title=CurioCity – CurioCité {{!}} Astronaut Abby|website=explorecuriocity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called the Soyuz Adventure, after Astronaut Parmitano returned to [[Earth]], it was renamed "The Future of Space" and Harrison continued to run the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/astronaut-abby-is-crowdfunding-her-way-to-outer-space/208184441/|title='Astronaut Abby' is crowdfunding her way to outer space|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://skepticlab.com/episode/029-mission-to-mars-with-astronaut-abby/|title=#029 – Mission to Mars with Astronaut Abby – SkepticLab|work=SkepticLab|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was the basis for the development of The Mars Generation nonprofit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sea.pcmag.com/news/9272/mars-and-the-public-imagination|title=Mars and the Public Imagination|date=2016-01-05|work=PCMag Asia|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trivium''' is the lower division of the [[seven liberal arts]] and comprises [[grammar]], [[dialectic]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="english-ety"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |editor1=Onions, C.T. |year=1991 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivium is implicit in ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by [[Martianus Capella]], but the term was not used until the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], when it was coined in imitation of the earlier [[quadrivium]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les arts libéraux dans l'Antiquité classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'études médiévales). pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in [[Plato]]'s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx and http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means "the place where three roads meet" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which comprised [[arithmetic]] (number), [[geometry]] (number in space), [[music]] (number in time), and [[astronomy]] (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="english-ety" /&gt;

== Description ==

'''[[Grammar]]''' teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student "comes to terms," defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.

'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the "mechanics" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.

'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).

[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

'''. . .'''

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''User innovation''' refers to [[innovation]] by intermediate users (e.g. user [[firm]]s) or [[consumer]] users (individual [[end-user]]s or user [[communities]]), rather than by suppliers (producers or [[manufacturers]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bogers, M.; Afuah, A.; Bastian, B. (2010), "[http://www.marcelbogers.com/Pubs/Bogers-Afuah-Bastian_2010_JOM_Users-as-innovators.pdf Users as innovators: A review, critique, and future research directions]", Journal of Management, 36 (4): 857–875.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concept closely aligned to [[co-design]], and has been proven to result in more innovative solutions than traditional consultation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign||date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205-220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric von Hippel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Hippel, E. (1986). Lead Users: A Source of Novel Product Concepts. Management Science, 32(7), 791-805. {{doi|10.1287/mnsc.32.7.791}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others observed that many products and services are actually developed or at least refined, by users, at the site of implementation and use. These ideas are then moved back into the supply network.  This is because products are developed to meet the widest possible need; when individual users face problems that the majority of consumers do not, they have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products, or entirely new products, to solve their issues.  Often, user innovators will share their ideas with manufacturers in hopes of having them produce the product, a process called free revealing.

Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software [[Ilkka Tuomi]] {{Harv|Tuomi|2002}} further highlighted the point that users are fundamentally social. User innovation, therefore, is also socially and socio-technically distributed innovation. According to Tuomi,&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I: ''Networks of Innovation'', chapter 2. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; key uses are often unintended uses invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of emerging technological opportunities.

The existence of user innovation, for example, by users of industrial robots, rather than the manufacturers of robots {{Harv|Fleck|1988}} is a core part of the argument against the Linear Innovation Model {{Harv|Williams|1996}} i.e. innovation comes from research and development, is then marketed and 'diffuses' to end-users. Instead innovation is a non-linear process involving innovations at all stages.

In 1986 Eric von Hippel introduced the [[lead user]] method that can be used to systematically learn about user innovation in order to apply it in [[new product development]]. In 2007 another specific type of user innovator, the [[creative consumer]] was introduced. These are consumers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering as opposed to creating completely new products.&lt;ref&gt;Berthon, PR.; Pitt, LF.; McCarthy I. and Kates, SB. (2007) "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=959581 When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers]", Business Horizons 50 (1), 39-47&lt;/ref&gt;

User innovation has a number of degrees: innovation of use, innovation in services, innovation in configuration of technologies, and finally the innovation of novel technologies themselves. While most user innovation is concentrated in use and configuration of existing products and technologies, and is a normal part of long term innovation, new technologies that are easier for end-users to change and innovate with, and new channels of communication are making it much easier for user innovation to occur and have an impact.

Recent research has focused on Web-based forums that facilitate user (or customer) innovation - referred to as [[virtual customer environment]], these forums help companies partner with their customers in various phases of product development as well as in other value creation activities. For example, [[Threadless]], a T-shirt manufacturing company, relies on the contribution of online community members in the design process. The community includes a group of volunteer designers who submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to free exposure, designers are provided monetary incentives including a $2,500 base award as well as a percentage of T-shirt sales. These incentives allow Threadless to encourage continual user contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Magee,Joe.

      <comment>/* Critical reactions */ Removed irrelevant critical reaction, mind viruses do not necessarily have to be negative, the concept of religions as mind viru is simply an attempt to explain their propagation.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
