[[Image:Alcubierre.png|thumbnail|350px|Two-dimensional visualization of an Alcubierre drive, showing the opposing regions of expanding and contracting spacetime that displace the central region]]
The '''Alcubierre drive''' or '''Alcubierre warp drive''' (or '''Alcubierre metric''', referring to [[Metric tensor#Lorentzian metrics from relativity|metric tensor]]) is a speculative idea based on a solution of [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] in [[general relativity]] as proposed by Mexican theoretical physicist [[Miguel Alcubierre]], by which a spacecraft could achieve [[apparent faster-than-light]] travel if a configurable [[energy density|energy-density]] field lower than that of vacuum (that is, [[negative mass]]) could be created.

Rather than exceeding the speed of light within a [[local reference frame]], a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel. Objects cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space without breaking any [[physical laws]].&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2003"&gt;{{cite journal|first=S. |last=Krasnikov|title=The quantum inequalities do not forbid spacetime shortcuts|journal=[[Physical Review D]] |date=2003|volume=67|pages=104013|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.67.104013|arxiv = gr-qc/0207057 |bibcode = 2003PhRvD..67j4013K|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the metric proposed by Alcubierre is consistent with the Einstein field equations, it may not be physically meaningful, in which case a drive will not be possible. Even if it is physically meaningful, its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed. The proposed mechanism of the Alcubierre drive implies a negative [[energy density]] and therefore requires [[exotic matter]]. So if exotic matter with the correct properties can not exist, then the drive could not be constructed. However, at the close of his original article&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alcubierre |first=Miguel|title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |date=1994|volume=11|pages=L73–L77|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcubierre argued (following an argument developed by physicists analyzing traversable [[wormhole]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kip | last=Thorne | author2=Michael Morris | author3=Ulvi Yurtsever | journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] | volume=61 | issue=13 | pages=1446–1449 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 | title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition | date=1988 | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf | bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M | pmid=10038800 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223165343/http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf | archivedate=23 February 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw81.html The Alcubierre Warp Drive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921185215/http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw81.html |date=21 September 2012 }} by John G. Cramer, where Cramer notes that "Alcubierre, following the lead of wormhole theorists, argues that quantum field theory permits the existence of regions of negative energy density under special circumstances, and cites the Casimir effect as an example."&lt;/ref&gt;) that the [[Casimir effect|Casimir vacuum]] between parallel plates could fulfill the negative-energy requirement for the Alcubierre drive.

Another possible issue is that, although the Alcubierre metric is consistent with Einstein's equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. Some physicists have presented arguments to suggest that a theory of [[quantum gravity]] (which would incorporate both theories) would eliminate those solutions in general relativity that allow for backwards time travel (''see'' the [[chronology protection conjecture]]) and thus make the Alcubierre drive invalid.

==History==
In 1994, Alcubierre proposed a [[theoretical physics|theory of physics]] for a method for changing the [[Shape of the universe|geometry of space]] by creating a wave that would cause the fabric of space ahead of a [[Starship|spacecraft]] to contract and the space behind it to expand.&lt;ref name="Alcubierre" /&gt; The ship would then ride this wave inside a region of flat space, known as a ''warp bubble'', and would not move within this bubble but instead be carried along as the region itself moves due to the actions of the drive. It was thought to use too much negative energy until [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold Sonny White]]&lt;ref name="Roundup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roundup|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/roundup/online/2012/0712.pdf|publisher=Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|date=July 2012|accessdate=1 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329040546/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/roundup/online/2012/0712.pdf|archivedate=29 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Harold Sonny White"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Harold "Sonny" White|title=Warp Field Mechanics 101|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936_2011016932.pdf|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020190121/http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936_2011016932.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the amount of energy required could be reduced if the warp bubble were changed into a warp ring.

==Alcubierre metric==
The Alcubierre [[metric tensor|metric]] defines the warp-drive [[spacetime]]. It is a [[Lorentzian manifold]] that, if interpreted in the context of [[general relativity]], allows a warp bubble to appear in previously flat spacetime and move away effectively [[faster than light]]speed. The interior of the bubble is an [[inertial reference frame]] and inhabitants suffer no proper acceleration. This method of transport does not involve objects in motion at speeds faster than light with respect to the contents of the warp bubble; that is, a light beam within the warp bubble would still always move faster than the ship. Because objects within the bubble are not moving (locally) faster than light, the mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity (namely, that an object with mass cannot attain or exceed the speed of light) and conventional [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects such as [[time dilation]] would not apply as they would with conventional motion at near-light speeds.

The Alcubierre drive, however, remains a hypothetical concept with seemingly difficult problems, though the amount of energy required is no longer thought to be unobtainably large.&lt;ref name="WDmorefeasible"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html |title=Warp Drive May Be More Feasible Than Thought, Scientists Say |first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |date=17 September 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=10 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113193555/http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics of the Alcubierre drive==
Using the [[ADM formalism]] of [[general relativity]], the [[spacetime]] is described by a [[foliation]] of space-like [[hypersurface]]s of constant coordinate time {{mvar|t}}, with the metric taking the following general form:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -\left(\alpha^2 - \beta_i \beta^i\right) \,dt^2 + 2 \beta_i \,dx^i \,dt + \gamma_{ij}\,dx^i\,dx^j,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*{{mvar|α}} is the lapse function that gives the interval of proper time between nearby hypersurfaces,
*{{mvar|β&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the shift vector that relates the spatial coordinate systems on different hypersurfaces,
*{{mvar|γ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a positive-definite metric on each of the hypersurfaces.

The particular form that Alcubierre studied&lt;ref name="Alcubierre" /&gt; is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \alpha &amp;= 1,\\
 \beta^x &amp;= -v_s(t)f\big(r_s(t)\big),\\
 \beta^y &amp;= \beta^z = 0,\\
 \gamma_{ij} &amp;= \delta_{ij},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 v_s(t) &amp;= \frac{dx_s(t)}{dt},\\
 r_s(t) &amp;= \sqrt{\big(x - x_s(t)\big)^2 + y^2 + z^2},\\
 f(r_s) &amp;= \frac{\tanh\big(\sigma (r_s + R)\big) - \tanh\big(\sigma (r_s - R)\big)}{2 \tanh(\sigma R)},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with arbitrary parameters {{math|''R'' &gt; 0}} and {{math|''σ'' &gt; 0}}. Alcubierre's specific form of the metric can thus be written

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \left(v_s(t)^2 f\big(r_s(t)\big)^2 - 1\right)\,dt^2 - 2v_s(t)f\big(r_s(t)\big)\,dx\,dt + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.&lt;/math&gt;

With this particular form of the metric, it can be shown that the energy density measured by observers whose 4-velocity is normal to the hypersurfaces is given by

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{c^4}{8 \pi G} \frac{v_s^2 \left(y^2 + z^2\right)}{4 g^2 r_s ^2} \left(\frac{df}{dr_s}\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|g}} is the determinant of the metric [[tensor]].

Thus, because the energy density is negative, one needs [[exotic matter]] to travel faster than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name="Alcubierre" /&gt; The existence of exotic matter is not theoretically ruled out; however, generating and sustaining enough exotic matter to perform feats such as faster-than-light travel (and also to keep open the "throat" of a [[wormhole]]) is thought to be impractical.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Low has argued that within the context of general relativity, it is impossible to construct a warp drive in the absence of exotic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Low |first=Robert J.|title=Speed Limits in General Relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|date=1999|volume=16|pages=543–549|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/16/2/016|arxiv = gr-qc/9812067 |bibcode = 1999CQGra..16..543L|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
For those familiar with the effects of special relativity, such as [[Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis|Lorentz contraction]] and [[time dilation]], the Alcubierre metric has some apparently peculiar aspects. In particular, Alcubierre has shown that a ship using an Alcubierre drive travels on a free-fall geodesic even while the warp bubble is accelerating: its crew would be in free fall while accelerating without experiencing accelerational [[g-force]]s. Enormous [[tidal force]]s, however, would be present near the edges of the flat-space volume because of the large space curvature there, but suitable specification of the metric would keep them very small within the volume occupied by the ship.&lt;ref name="Alcubierre" /&gt;

The original warp-drive metric and simple variants of it happen to have the [[ADM formalism|ADM form]], which is often used in discussing the initial-value formulation of general relativity. This might explain the widespread misconception that this spacetime is a ''solution'' of the field equation of general relativity.{{Citation needed|reason=that Natario paper does not seem to say it's a "misconception" that the Alcubierre drive is a solution, it just talks about the misconception that it requires space in front of the bubble to contract and space behind it to expand|date=August 2013}} Metrics in ADM form are ''adapted'' to a certain family of inertial observers, but these observers are not really physically distinguished from other such families. Alcubierre interpreted his "warp bubble" in terms of a contraction of space ahead of the bubble and an expansion behind, but this interpretation could be misleading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Natario|first=Jose|title=Warp drive with zero expansion|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|date=2002|volume=19|pages=1157–1166|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/19/6/308|arxiv = gr-qc/0110086 |bibcode = 2002CQGra..19.1157N|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since the contraction and expansion actually refer to the relative motion of nearby members of the family of ADM observers.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In general relativity, one often first specifies a plausible distribution of matter and energy, and then finds the geometry of the spacetime associated with it; but it is also possible to run the [[Einstein field equations]] in the other direction, first specifying a metric and then finding the [[stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] associated with it, and this is what Alcubierre did in building his metric. This practice means that the solution can violate various [[energy conditions]] and require [[exotic matter]]. The need for exotic matter raises questions about whether one can distribute the matter in an initial spacetime that lacks a warp bubble in such a way that the bubble is created at a later time, although some physicists have proposed models of dynamical warp-drive spacetimes in which a warp bubble is formed in a previously flat space.&lt;ref name=Finazzi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Finazzi, Stefano|author2=Liberati, Stefano|author3=Barceló, Carlos |title=Semiclassical instability of dynamical warp drives|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=2009|volume=79|pages=124017|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.124017|bibcode = 2009PhRvD..79l4017F|issue=12 |arxiv = 0904.0141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to [[Serguei Krasnikov]],&lt;ref name="Krasnikov1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Krasnikov|title=Hyper-fast travel in general relativity|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=1998|volume=57|pages=4760|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.57.4760|arxiv = gr-qc/9511068 |bibcode = 1998PhRvD..57.4760K|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating a bubble in a previously flat space for a ''one-way'' FTL trip requires forcing the exotic matter to move at local faster-than-light speeds, something that would require the existence of [[tachyons]], although Krasnikov also notes that when the spacetime is not flat from the outset, a similar result could be achieved without tachyons by placing in advance some devices along the travel path and programming them to come into operation at preassigned moments and to operate in a preassigned manner. Some suggested methods avoid the problem of tachyonic motion, but would probably generate a [[naked singularity]] at the front of the bubble.&lt;ref name=Broeck&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/9906050|first=Chris |last=Van den Broeck|title=On the (im)possibility of warp bubbles|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coule"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |volume=15 |date=1998 |pages=2523–2537 |url=http://omnis.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/warp/etc/cqg15_2523.pdf |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/15/8/026 |title=No warp drive |last1=Coule |first1=D.

It only means that the actions required to change the metric and create the bubble must be taken beforehand by some observer whose forward [[light cone]] contains the entire trajectory of the bubble."&lt;ref name="Everett1997"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Allen|last=Everett|author2=Roman, Thomas| title=A Superluminal Subway: The Krasnikov Tube|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=1997|volume=56|pages=2100–2108|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.56.2100|arxiv = gr-qc/9702049 |issue=4|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..56.2100E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For example, if one wanted to travel to [[Deneb]] (2,600 light years away) and arrive less than 2,600 years in the future according to external clocks, it would be required that someone had already begun work on warping the space from Earth to Deneb at least 2,600 years ago: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A spaceship appropriately located with respect to the bubble trajectory could then choose to enter the bubble, rather like a passenger catching a passing trolley car, and thus make the superluminal journey...as Krasnikov points out, causality considerations do not prevent the crew of a spaceship from arranging, by their own actions, to complete a ''round trip'' from Earth to a distant star and back in an arbitrarily short time, as measured by clocks on Earth, by altering the metric along the path of their outbound trip."&lt;ref name="Everett1997"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In conformal gravity===
Within the framework of [[conformal gravity]], an extension of [[general relativity]] in which the angles of spacetime are locally preserved, the Alcubierre metric does not violate the weak energy condition for particular spacetime shapes, and hence faster-than-light travel would not require [[exotic matter]].&lt;ref name=conformalgravity&gt;Varieschi, G. U. &amp; Burstein, Z. (2013). [http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/482734.pdf Conformal gravity and the Alcubierre warp drive metric] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108052249/http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/482734.pdf |date=8 November 2014 }}. ''ISRN Astronomy and Astrophysics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
The metric of this form has significant difficulties because all known warp-drive spacetime theories violate various [[energy conditions]].&lt;ref name="Van den Broeck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van den Broeck |first=Christian | bibcode=2000AIPC..504.1105V |doi= 10.1063/1.1290913| title = Alcubierre's warp drive: Problems and prospects| date= 2000|journal= AIP Conference Proceedings |volume =504| pages=1105–1110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, an Alcubierre-type warp drive might be realized by exploiting certain experimentally verified quantum phenomena, such as the [[Casimir effect]], that lead to [[stress–energy tensor]]s that also violate the energy conditions, such as negative [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]], when described in the context of the quantum field theories.&lt;ref&gt;Krasnikov (2003), p.13, "Moreover, by analogy with the Casimir effect, it is reasonable to assume that ρ in such a wormhole will be large (∼''L''&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;), which would relieve one of having to seek additional sources of exotic matter."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Roman (1995), p.5, "...the Casimir effect may be useful as an illustration. Here one has a constant negative energy density..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass–energy requirement===
If certain [[quantum inequalities]] conjectured by Ford and Roman hold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=L. H. |last1=Ford |first2=T. A. |last2=Roman|title=Quantum field theory constrains traversable wormhole geometries|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=1996|pages=5496|volume=53|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.53.5496|arxiv = gr-qc/9510071 |bibcode = 1996PhRvD..53.5496F|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the energy requirements for some warp drives may be unfeasibly large as well as negative. For example, the energy equivalent of −10&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; kg might be required&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pfenning, Michael J.|author2=Ford, L. H.|title=The unphysical nature of 'Warp Drive'|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|date=1997|volume=14|pages=1743–1751|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/14/7/011|arxiv = gr-qc/9702026 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14.1743P|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to transport a small spaceship across the Milky Way—an amount orders of magnitude greater than the estimated [[mass of the observable universe]]. Counterarguments to these apparent problems have also been offered.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2003"/&gt;

Chris Van den Broeck of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in Belgium, in 1999, tried to address the potential issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den Broeck |first=Chris|title=A 'warp drive' with more reasonable total energy requirements|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |date=1999|volume=16|pages=3973–3979|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/16/12/314|arxiv = gr-qc/9905084 |bibcode = 1999CQGra..16.3973V|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contracting the 3+1-dimensional surface area of the bubble being transported by the drive, while at the same time expanding the three-dimensional volume contained inside, Van den Broeck was able to reduce the total energy needed to transport small atoms to less than three [[solar mass]]es. Later, by slightly modifying the Van den Broeck metric, [[Serguei Krasnikov]] reduced the necessary total amount of  [[negative mass]] to a few milligrams.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van den Broeck"/&gt; Van den Broeck detailed this by saying that the total energy can be reduced dramatically by keeping the surface area of the warp bubble itself microscopically small, while at the same time expanding the spatial volume inside the bubble. However, Van den Broeck concludes that the energy densities required are still unachievable, as are the small size (a few orders of magnitude above the [[Planck scale]]) of the spacetime structures needed.&lt;ref name=Broeck/&gt;

In 2012, physicist [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold White]] and collaborators announced that modifying the geometry of exotic matter could reduce the mass–energy requirements for a macroscopic space ship from the equivalent of the planet [[Jupiter]] to that of the [[Voyager 1]] spacecraft (~700&amp;nbsp;kg)&lt;ref name=WDmorefeasible/&gt; or less,&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[io9]] |title=How NASA might build its very first warp drive |url=http://io9.com/5963263/how-nasa-will-build-its-very-first-warp-drive |first=George |last=Dvorsky |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110031042/http://io9.com/5963263/how-nasa-will-build-its-very-first-warp-drive |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated their intent to perform small-scale experiments in constructing warp fields.&lt;ref name=WDmorefeasible/&gt; White proposed changing the shape of the warp bubble from a sphere to a [[torus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Harold|title=Nasa Physicist|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/20/warp-drives|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408225609/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/20/warp-drives|archivedate=8 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if the intensity of the space warp can be oscillated over time, the energy required is reduced even more.&lt;ref name=WDmorefeasible/&gt; According to White, a modified [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson–Morley interferometer]] could test the idea: one of the legs of the interferometer would appear to have a slightly different length when the test devices were energised.&lt;ref name=io9/&gt;

===Placement of matter===
Krasnikov proposed that if [[tachyon|tachyonic matter]] cannot be found or used, then a solution might be to arrange for masses along the path of the vessel to be set in motion in such a way that the required field was produced. But in this case, the Alcubierre drive vessel can only travel routes that, like a railroad, have first been equipped with the necessary infrastructure. The pilot inside the bubble is causally disconnected with its walls and cannot carry out any action outside the bubble: the bubble cannot be used for the first trip to a distant star because the pilot cannot place infrastructure ahead of the bubble while "in transit". For example, travelling to [[Vega]] (which is 25 light-years from Earth) requires arranging everything so that the bubble moving toward Vega with a superluminal velocity would appear; such arrangements will always take more than 25 years.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov1998"/&gt;

Coule has argued that schemes, such as the one proposed by Alcubierre, are infeasible because matter placed ''en route'' of the intended path of a craft must be placed at superluminal speed—that constructing an Alcubierre drive requires an Alcubierre drive even if the metric that allows it is physically meaningful. Coule further argues that an analogous objection will apply to ''any'' proposed method of constructing an Alcubierre drive.&lt;ref name="Coule"/&gt;

===Survivability inside the bubble===
An article by José Natário (2002) argues that crew members could not control, steer or stop the ship because the ship could not send signals to the front of the bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=gr-qc/0110086 |bibcode=2002CQGra..19.1157N |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/19/6/308 |journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|title=Warp drive with zero expansion|date=2002|last1=Natário|first1=José|volume=19|issue=6|pages=1157–1165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent article by Carlos Barceló, Stefano Finazzi, and Stefano Liberati uses quantum theory to argue that the Alcubierre drive at faster-than-light velocities is impossible mostly because extremely high temperatures caused by [[Hawking radiation]] would destroy anything inside the bubble at superluminal velocities and destabilize the bubble itself; the article also argues that these problems are absent if the bubble velocity is subluminal, although the drive still requires exotic matter.&lt;ref name=Finazzi /&gt;

===Damaging effect on destination===

Brendan McMonigal, [[Geraint F. Lewis]], and Philip O'Byrne have argued that when an Alcubierre-driven ship decelerates from superluminal speed, the particles that its bubble has gathered in transit would be released in energetic outbursts akin to a [[sonic boom]] [[shockwave]]; in the case of forward-facing particles, energetic enough to destroy anything at the destination directly in front of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Jason |last=Major |date=29 February 2012 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/93882/warp-drives-may-come-with-a-killer-downside/#ixzz2FaZsXDuM |title=Warp Drives May Come With a Killer Downside |work=[[Universe Today]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210175842/http://www.universetoday.com/93882/warp-drives-may-come-with-a-killer-downside/#ixzz2FaZsXDuM |archivedate=10 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan McMonigal, Geraint F.

===Wall thickness===
The amount of negative energy required for such a propulsion is not yet known. Pfenning and Allen Everett of [[Tufts University|Tufts]] hold that a warp bubble traveling at 10 times light-speed must have a wall thickness of no more than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; meters—close to the limiting [[Planck length]], &lt;span class=nowrap&gt;1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael John Pfenning|title=Quantum Inequality Restrictions on Negative Energy Densities in Curved Spacetimes.|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9805037.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706093408/https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9805037.pdf|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Miguel Alcubierre's original calculations, a bubble macroscopically large enough to enclose a ship of 200 meters would require a total amount of exotic matter greater than the mass of the observable universe, and straining the exotic matter to an extremely thin band of 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; meters is considered impractical. Similar constraints apply to [[Krasnikov tube|Krasnikov's superluminal subway]]. Chris Van den Broeck recently constructed a modification of Alcubierre's model that requires much less exotic matter but places the ship in a curved space-time "bottle" whose neck is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; meters.&lt;ref name=Broeck/&gt;

===Causality violation and semiclassical instability===
Calculations by physicist Allen Everett show that warp bubbles could be used to create [[closed timelike curve]]s in general relativity, meaning that the theory predicts that they could be used for backwards [[time travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Everett | first = Allen E. | title = Warp drive and causality | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 53 | issue = 12 | pages = 7365–7368 | date = 15 June 1996 | url = http://exvacuo.free.fr/div/Sciences/Dossiers/Time/A%20E%20Everett%20-%20Warp%20drive%20and%20causality%20-%20prd950914.pdf | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.53.7365 | accessdate = 24 July 2013 | bibcode = 1996PhRvD..53.7365E | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131012115010/http://exvacuo.free.fr/div/Sciences/Dossiers/Time/A%20E%20Everett%20-%20Warp%20drive%20and%20causality%20-%20prd950914.pdf | archivedate = 12 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible that the fundamental laws of physics might allow closed timelike curves, the [[chronology protection conjecture]] hypothesizes that in all cases where the classical theory of general relativity allows them, quantum effects would intervene to eliminate the possibility, making these spacetimes impossible to realize (a possible type of effect that would accomplish this is a buildup of vacuum fluctuations on the border of the region of spacetime where time travel would first become possible, causing the energy density to become high enough to destroy the system that would otherwise become a time machine). Some results in [[semiclassical gravity]] appear to support the conjecture, including a calculation dealing specifically with quantum effects in warp-drive spacetimes that suggested that warp bubbles would be semiclassically unstable,&lt;ref name=Finazzi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barcelo&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Barceló, Carlos|author2=Finazzi, Stefano|author3=Liberati, Stefano |eprint = 1001.4960| title=On the impossibility of superluminal travel: the warp drive lesson|class=gr-qc |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately the conjecture can only be decided by a full theory of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visser | first = Matt | title = The reliability horizon for semi-classical quantum gravity: Metric fluctuations are often more important than back-reaction | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 415 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–14 | date = December 1997 | doi = 10.1016/S0370-2693(97)01226-4 | accessdate = | arxiv = gr-qc/9702041 | bibcode = 1997PhLB..415....8V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Alcubierre briefly discusses some of these issues in a series of lecture slides posted online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccrg.rit.edu/files/FasterThanLight.pdf |title=Faster than light |accessdate=2017-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318223348/http://ccrg.rit.edu/files/FasterThanLight.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he writes: "beware: in relativity, any method to travel faster than light can in principle be used to travel back in time (a time machine)". In the next slide he brings up the chronology protection conjecture and writes: "The conjecture has not been proven (it wouldn’t be a conjecture if it had), but there are good arguments in its favor based on quantum field theory. The conjecture does not prohibit faster-than-light travel. It just states that if a method to travel faster than light exists, and one tries to use it to build a time machine, something will go wrong: the energy accumulated will explode, or it will create a black hole."

==Experiments==
{{main|Warp-field experiments|White–Juday warp-field interferometer}}
In 2012, a [[NASA]] laboratory announced that they had constructed an [[interferometer]] that they claim will detect the spatial distortions produced by the expanding and contracting spacetime of the Alcubierre metric. The work has been described in ''Warp Field Mechanics 101'', a NASA paper by [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold Sonny White]].&lt;ref name="Roundup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Harold Sonny White"/&gt; Alcubierre has expressed skepticism about the experiment, saying: "from my understanding there is no way it can be done, probably not for centuries if at all".&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/malcubierre/status/362011821277839360 Miguel Alcubierre's Twitter feed, 29 July 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109183703/https://twitter.com/malcubierre/status/362011821277839360 |date=9 January 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013SSC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dr. Harold "Sonny" White|title=2013 Starship Congress: Warp Field Physics, an Update|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucyBMB_PWr8|publisher=Icarus Interstellar|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120181345/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucyBMB_PWr8|archivedate=20 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to ''Star Trek'' warp drive==

The ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series used the term "[[warp drive]]" to describe their method of faster-than-light travel. Neither the Alcubierre theory, nor anything similar, existed when the series was conceived, but Alcubierre stated in an email to [[William Shatner]] that his theory was directly inspired by the term used in the show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Alan|title=The Physics of Warp Drive|url=http://www.alan-shapiro.com/the-physics-of-warp-drive/|accessdate=2 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424012220/http://www.alan-shapiro.com/the-physics-of-warp-drive/|archive-date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and references the "'warp drive' of science fiction" in his 1994 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''An Introduction to Sustainable Development''''' is a 2007 [[Earthscan]] book which presents [[sustainable development]] as a process that "meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This textbook examines the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainable development by exploring changing patterns of consumption, production, and distribution of resources.  Case studies include coastal wetlands;  community-based water supply and sanitation systems; and sustainable energy, forest, and industrial development.&lt;ref name=auth&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=1415  An Introduction to Sustainable Development]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/ROGINT.html An Introduction to Sustainable Development]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-nuclear protests'''  began on a small scale in the U.S. as early as 1946 in response to [[Operation Crossroads]].&lt;ref&gt;Radio Bikini. DVD. Directed by Stone, Robert. Produced by Robert Stone Productions. 1988; New Video Group, 2003. www.imdb.com/title/tt0093817/&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale anti-nuclear protests first emerged in the mid-1950s in Japan in the wake of the March 1954 [[Lucky dragon|Lucky Dragon Incident]]. August 1955 saw the first meeting of the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which had around 3,000 participants from Japan and other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, Robert.

In 1964, Peace Marches which featured "Ban the bomb" placards, were held in several Australian capital cities.&lt;ref name="australia1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="australia2"/&gt;

In 1972, the [[Nuclear disarmament|anti-nuclear weapons]] movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to [[French nuclear testing]] there. Activists, including [[David McTaggart]] from [[Greenpeace]], defied the French government by sailing small vessels into the test zone and interrupting the testing program.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis.

Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the tests; unions refused to load French ships, service French planes, or carry French mail; and consumers boycotted French products. In Fiji, activists formed an Against Testing on [[Mururoa]] organization.&lt;ref name=japanfocus/&gt;

In November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moritorium on uranium mining.  In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;Falk, Jim (1982). ''Gobal Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', pp. 264–5.&lt;/ref&gt; A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium.  In August, another demonstration brought 50,000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, Alice (1992). ''Atomic Australia 1944–1990'', New South Wales University Press, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's largest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985.&lt;ref name="japanfocus"/&gt; The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific.&lt;ref name=japanfocus/&gt;

On Dec 17th 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/12/18/443080.htm|title=Greenpeace raid on Australian nuclear reactor|date=2001-12-18|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to mark one year since the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to [[uranium mining in Australia]]. There were also events in Sydney, and in Melbourne the protest included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are worried about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |title=Australian Rallies Remember Fukushima Disaster |author=Phil Mercer |date=March 11, 2012 |work=VOA News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312194611/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, 15,000 people demonstrated against French plans to locate the first light-water reactor power plant in Bugey. This was the first of a series of mass protests organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France until the massive demonstration at the [[Superphénix]] breeder reactor in Creys-Malvillein in 1977 culminated in violence.&lt;ref name=nelkin&gt;Dorothy Nelkin and Michael Pollak (1982).

In France, between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations.&lt;ref name="marcuse"/&gt;

In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPWR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/01/18/1027267.htm Thousands march in Paris anti-nuclear protest] ''ABC News'', January 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands staged anti-nuclear protests around France, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl and after Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], demanding reactors be closed. Protesters' demands were focused on getting France to shut its oldest nuclear power station at Fessenheim, which lies in a densely populated part of France, less than two kilometres from Germany and around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Switzerland.&lt;ref name=afp11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-RY6At4kvtH2P31Nk5xiUeIr8mw?docId=CNG.e738123e4ccce6019851c695501ca633.1211 |title=Thousands in France mark Chernobyl with protests  |author=Arnaud Bouvier  |date=Apr 25, 2011  |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2,000 people also protested at the Cattenom nuclear plant, France's second most powerful, in the Mosel region to the northwest of Strasbourg. Protesters in southwestern France staged another demonstration in the form of a mass picnic in front of the Blayais nuclear reactor, also in memory of Chernobyl. In France's northwestern region of Brittany, around 800 people staged a good-humoured march in front of the Brennilis experimental heavy-water atomic plant that was built in the 1960s. It was taken offline in 1985 but its dismantling is still not completed after 25 years.&lt;ref name=afp11/&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name=spieg11/&gt; Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made.&lt;ref name=spieg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,800319,00.html |title=Thousands of Protesters Obstruct Nuclear Waste Transport |author= |date=2011-11-28 |work=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They scaled the roof of the domed reactor building and unfurled a "Safe Nuclear Doesn't Exist" banner before attracting the attention of security guards. Two activists remained at large for four hours. On the same day, two more campaigners breached the perimeter of the [[Cruas Nuclear Power Plant]], escaping detection for more than 14 hours, while posting videos of their sit-in on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2017034281.html |title= Breaches at N-plants heighten France's debate over reactors |author=Tara Patel |date=December 16, 2011 |work=Seattle Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aquitaine]], the local group [[TchernoBlaye]] continue to protest against the continued operation of the [[Blayais Nuclear Power Plant]].

On the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], organisers of French anti-nuclear demonstrations claim 60,000 supporters formed a human chain 230 kilometres long, stretching from Lyon to Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/03/11/anti-nuclear-demos-across-europe-on-fukushima-anniversary/ |title=Anti-nuclear demos across Europe on Fukushima anniversary |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, police arrested 57 Greenpeace protesters who used a truck to break through security barriers and enter the Fessenheim nuclear power plant in eastern France. The activists hung antinuclear banners, but France’s nuclear safety authority said that the plant’s security had not been compromised. President Hollande has promised to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants immediate closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/france-greenpeace-activists-arrested-in-break-in.html?_r=0  |title=France: Greenpeace Activists Arrested in Break-In |author= |date=March 18, 2014 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen C.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt;

In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.&lt;ref name="dw-world" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16FA3F5D0C728CDDAA0894D9484D81 West Germans Clash at Site of A-Plant] ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DC1439F932A35750C0A967948260 Violence Mars West German Protest] ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest anti-nuclear protest was most likely a 1983 nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin which had about 600,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/2007/02/edwards_calls_i.html Blogs for Bush: The White House Of The Blogosphere: Edwards Calls Israel a Threat]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024242/http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/2007/02/edwards_calls_i.html |date=June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the arms race. The largest turnout of protesters occurred in West Germany when, on a single day, 400,000 people marched in Bonn, 400,000 in Hamburg, 250,000 in Stuttgart, and 100,000 in West Berlin.&lt;ref name="university148"/&gt;

In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police "used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".&lt;ref name="time1986"/&gt;

During a weekend in October 2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in many years and, according to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', it signals a revival of the [[anti-nuclear movement in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589456,00.html The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement] ''Spiegel Online'', 11/10/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589782,00.html Anti-Nuclear Protest Reawakens: Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests] ''Spiegel Online'', 11/11/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sturdee.

About 3,000 people protested outside of [[RWE]]'s headquarters in Essen. Other smaller rallies were held elsewhere.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name="spieg11"/&gt;

==India==
Following the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the former Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A.&amp;nbsp;Gopalakrishnan. The massive [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] is the focus of concern — "931&amp;nbsp;hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000&amp;nbsp;people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields" — and it has attracted many protests. Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/indian-antinuclear-protesters-will-not-be-deterred-20110422-1drcv.html#ixzz1KOlpfMoG |title=Indian anti-nuclear protesters will not be deterred |first=Ben |last=Doherty |date=April 23, 2011  |work=Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned six-reactor nuclear power complex on the plains of Jaitapur, 420&amp;nbsp;km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. During two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fisherman-shot-dead-in-indian-nuke-protest/story-e6frg6so-1226042424159 |title=Fisherman shot dead in Indian nuke protest |author=Amanda Hodge  |date=April 21, 2011   |work=The Australian  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2011, thousands of protesters and villagers living around the Russian-built [[Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant]] in the southern Tamil Nadu province, are blocking highways and staging hunger strikes, preventing further construction work, and demanding its closure as they fear of the disasters like the [[Environmental impact of nuclear power]], [[Radioactive waste]], [[nuclear accident]] similar to the releases of radioactivity in March at Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=nzh11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10762102 |title=Indian activists fear nuclear plant accident |author=Rahul Bedi |date=October 28, 2011 |work=NZ Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court. The PIL specifically asks for the "staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies".&lt;ref name=nukeindia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3889&amp;Itemid=614 |title=

In 1982, [[Chugoku Electric Power Company]] proposed building a [[nuclear power plant]] near [[Iwaishima]], but many residents opposed the idea, and the island’s fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders carried out. Since the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/world/asia/28nuclear.html |title=Japanese Island’s Activists Resist Nuclear Industry’s Allure |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=August 27, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research results show that some 95 post-war attempts to site and build nuclear power plants resulted in only 54 completions. Many affected communities "fought back in highly publicized battles". Co-ordinated opposition groups, such as the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center and the anti-nuclear newspaper ''Hangenpatsu Shinbun'' have operated since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=api12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/22213/api103.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Post-crisis nuclear policy |author=[[Daniel P.

In July 2011, Japanese mothers, many new to political activism, have started "taking to the streets to urge the government to protect their children from radiation leaking from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant". Using social networking media, such as Facebook and Twitter, they have "organized antinuclear energy rallies nationwide attended by thousands of protesters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110709f2.html |title=Moms rally around antinuke cause |author=Junko Horiuichi |date=July 9, 2011 |work=The Japan Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/602ujA6Wp?url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110709f2.html |archivedate=2011-07-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, "took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant".&lt;ref name=reut11/&gt; An estimated 2,500 people marched past TEPCO headquarters, and created a human chain around the building of the Trade Ministry that oversees the power industry. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.&lt;ref name=reut11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/11/us-japan-quake-protests-idUSTRE78A1AB20110911 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protests mark 6 months since quake |author=Olivier Fabre |date=11 September 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011, chanting "Sayonara nuclear power" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and [[anti-nuclear]] causes addressed the crowd. Musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], who composed the score to the movie ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' was also among the event's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |author= |date=September 2011 |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama on the weekend of January 14–15, 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand was for the protection of rights for those affected by the Fukushima accident, including basic human rights such as health care, living standards and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20120122a2.html |title=Protesting nuclear power |author= |date=Jan 22, 2012 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{Further|Nuclear-free zone#New Zealand}}

From the early 1960s New Zealand peace groups [[CND]] and the Peace Media organised nationwide anti-nuclear campaigns in protest of [[Nuclear testing|atmospheric testing]] in [[French Polynesia]]. These included two large national [[petitions]] presented to the New Zealand government which led to a joint [[New Zealand]] and [[Australian]] Government action to take France to the [[International Court of Justice]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124170238/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/index.html |date=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Greenpeace]] and an amalgam of [[New Zealand]] peace groups managed to delay nuclear tests by several weeks by trespassing with a ship in the testing zone. During the time, the skipper, [[David McTaggart]], was beaten and severely injured by members of the French military.

On 1 July 1972, the Canadian [[ketch]] ''[[Greenpeace#Moruroa Atoll and the Vega|Vega]]'', flying the [[Greenpeace]] III banner, collided with the French naval minesweeper ''La Paimpolaise'' while in [[international waters]] to protest French [[nuclear weapon]] [[Moruroa|tests]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].

In 1973 the New Zealand Peace Media organised an international flotilla of protest yachts including the [[Fri (yacht)|Fri]], Spirit of Peace, Boy Roel, Magic Island and the Tanmure to sail into the test exclusion zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.bullerdc.govt.nz/cgi-bin/library/liinquiry?acc=00000711 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209094841/http://library.bullerdc.govt.nz/cgi-bin/library/liinquiry?acc=00000711 |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Norman Kirk]] as a symbolic act of protest sent two navy frigates, [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS Canterbury]] and [[HMNZS Otago]], to Mururoa.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723050155/http://www.mururoavet.com/] They were accompanied by [[HMAS Supply|HMAS ''Supply'']], a fleet oiler of the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frame |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop) |title=No Pleasure Cruise: the story of the Royal Australian Navy |year=2004 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=Crows Nest |isbn=1-74114-233-4 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the Greenpeace ship ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' was [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombed and sunk]] by the French [[Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure|DGSE]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], as it prepared for another protest of [[nuclear test]]ing in French military zones. One crew member, [[Fernando Pereira]] of [[Portugal]], photographer, drowned on the sinking ship while attempting to recover his photographic equipment. Two members of DGSE were captured and sentenced, but eventually repatriated to France in a controversial affair.

In the Philippines, a focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]], which was built but never operated.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;  The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zone.&lt;ref name=as&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yok-shiu F.

In March 2012, environmental conservation groups staged a rally in central Seoul to voice opposition to nuclear power on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. According to organizers, over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the biggest in recent memory for an antinuclear demonstration. The rally adopted a declaration demanding that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy to promote nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/international/news/20120311p2g00m0in018000c.html |title=Antinuclear rally held in Seoul on eve of Japan quake anniversary |author= |date=March 11, 2012 |work=Mainichi Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719173708/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/international/news/20120311p2g00m0in018000c.html |archivedate=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{See also|Anti-nuclear movement in Spain}}

In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects.&lt;ref name=spain&gt;Lutz Mez, [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]] (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co.

This has been called the "biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In June 2010, Greenpeace [[anti-nuclear]] activists invaded Forsmark nuclear power plant to protest the then-plan to remove the government prohibition on building new nuclear power plants.  In October 2012, 20 Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter fence of the Ringhals nuclear plant, and there was also an incursion of 50 activists at the Forsmark plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were protests against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it says are unsafe in European stress tests, and to emphasise that stress tests did nothing to prepare against threats from outside the plant. A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that "the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurethe-antis-attack/ |title=The antis attack! |author= |date=5 April 2013 |work=Nuclear Engineering International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's [[Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant|fourth nuclear power plant]]. The protesters were also opposed to lifespan extensions for three existing nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20110320-269104.html |title=Over 2,000 rally against nuclear plants in Taiwan |author= |date=March 20, 2011  |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in [[Taipei City]], which had a carnival-like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and waving sunflowers. This was part of a nationwide "No Nuke Action" protest, against construction of the fourth nuclear plant and in favor of a more [[renewable energy policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/01/2003502115 |title=Anti-nuclear rally draws legions |author=Lee I-Chia |date=May 1, 2011 |work=Taipei Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yLEqVOgb?url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/01/2003502115 |archivedate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[World Environment Day]] in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation’s three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of the fourth plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/06/05/2003505021 |title=Conservationists protest against nuclear policies |author=Lee I-Chia |date=June 5, 2011 |work=Tapai Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island by taking lessons from Japan's disaster on March 11, 2011. They "want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant – the fourth in densely populated Taiwan". Scores of aboriginal protesters "demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their [[Orchid Island]], off south-eastern Taiwan. Authorities have failed to find a substitute storage site amid increased awareness of nuclear danger over the past decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_776471.html |title=About 2,000 Taiwanese stage anti-nuclear protest |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Straits Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, 68,000 Taiwanese protested across major cities against the island’s fourth nuclear power plant, which is under construction. Taiwan’s three existing nuclear plants are near the ocean, and prone to geological fractures, under the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/taiwan-anti-nuclear-protests-may-derail-8-9-billion-power-plant.html |title=Taiwan Anti-Nuclear Protests May Derail $8.9 Billion Power Plant |author=Yu-Huay Sun  |date=Mar 11, 2013   |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="cnduk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many significant anti-nuclear mobilizations in the 1980s occurred at the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]]. It began in September 1981 after a [[Wales|Welsh]] group called "Women for Life on Earth" arrived at Greenham to protest against the decision of the Government to allow [[cruise missile]]s to be based there.&lt;ref name="university1"/&gt; The women's peace camp attracted significant media attention and "prompted the creation of other peace camps at more than a dozen sites in Britain and elsewhere in Europe".&lt;ref name="university1" /&gt; In December 1982 some 30,000 women from various peace camps and other peace organisations held a major protest against nuclear weapons on Greenham Common.&lt;ref name="university148" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wit144/&gt;

On 1 April 1983, about 70,000 people linked arms to form a human chain between three nuclear weapons centres in Berkshire. The anti-nuclear demonstration stretched for 14&amp;nbsp;miles along the Kennet Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brown, Shyama Perera and Martin Wainwright.

In London, in October 1983, more than 300,000 people assembled in Hyde Park. This was "the largest protest against nuclear weapons in British history", according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="university148" /&gt;

In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging [[UK Trident programme|Trident weapons system]] with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.&lt;ref name="thebulletin"/&gt;

In October 2008 in the United Kingdom, more than 30 people were arrested during one of the largest anti-nuclear protests at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] at Aldermaston for 10 years. The demonstration marked the start of the UN World Disarmament Week and involved about 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/28/anti-nuclear-aldermaston-protest-disarmament More than 30 arrests at Aldermaston anti-nuclear protest] ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]] site. Members of several anti-nuclear groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/03/hinkley-point-protest-nuclear-power |title=Hinkley Point power station blockaded by anti-nuclear protesters |author= |date=3 October 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, three hundred anti-nuclear protestors took to the streets of Llangefnia, against plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa. The march was organised by a number of organisations, including Pobl Atal Wylfa B, Greenpeace and Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which are supporting farmer Richard Jones who is in dispute with Horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theonlinemail.co.uk/bangor-and-anglesey-news/local-bangor-and-anglesey-news/2012/01/25/hundreds-protest-against-nuclear-power-station-plans-66580-30188845/ |title=Hundreds protest against nuclear power station plans |author=Elgan Hearn |date=Jan 25, 2012  |work=Online Mail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2012, the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], hundreds of anti-nuclear campaigners formed a symbolic chain around Hinkley Point to express their determined opposition to new nuclear power plants, and to call on the coalition government to abandon its plan for seven other new nuclear plants across the UK. The human chain continued for 24 hours, with the activists blocking the main Hinkley Point entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html |title=Brits protest against govt. nuclear plans |author= |date=Mar 10, 2012 |work=PressTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413112359/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html |archivedate=2012-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, thousands of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition wants to see an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies should be used for health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the [[Faslane Naval Base]], where Trident missiles are stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-anti-nuclear-protesters-glasgow-march-1828754 |title=Thousands of anti-nuclear protesters attend Glasgow march against Trident  |author= |date=13 April 2013 |work=Daily Record }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

On May 2, 1977, 1,414 [[Clamshell Alliance]] protesters were arrested at [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kenney.

The protesters who were arrested were charged with criminal trespass and asked to post bail ranging from $100 to $500. They refused and were then held in five national guard armories for 12 days. The Seabrook conflict, and role of New Hampshire Governor [[Meldrim Thomson]], received much national media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani.

The American public were concerned about the release of radioactive gas from the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 and many mass demonstrations took place across the country in the following months.  The largest one was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved two hundred thousand people; speeches were given by [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald J.

On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name="thenation2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="university145"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icanw1982"/&gt;

Beginning in 1982, an annual series of [[Christian]] peace vigils called the "Lenten Desert Experience" were held over a period of several weeks at a time, at the entrance to the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the USA. This led to a faith-based aspect of the nuclear disarmament movement and the formation of the anti-nuclear [[Nevada Desert Experience]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Butigan|title=Pilgrimage through a Burning World: Spiritual Practice and Nonviolent Protest at the Nevada Test Site|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzZFXx-fvpgC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8650-4|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice]] was located in [[Seneca County, New York]], adjacent to the [[Seneca Army Depot]]. It took place mainly during the summer of 1983. Thousands of women came to participate and rally against nuclear weapons and the "[[patriarchal society]]" that created and used those weapons.  The purpose of the Encampment was to stop the scheduled deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles before their suspected shipment from the Seneca Army Depot to Europe that fall. The Encampment continued as an active political presence in the Finger Lakes area for at least 5 more years.

Hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1986 in what is referred to as the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]].  The march took nine months to traverse {{Convert|3700|mi}}, advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19861116&amp;id=6NARAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5ekDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4346,12809 Hundreds of Marchers Hit Washington in Finale of Nationwide Peace March] ''Gainesville Sun'', November 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-nuclear organisation "Nevada Semipalatinsk" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former [[Soviet Union]].  It attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the [[nuclear test site]] at [[Semipalatinsk]], in north-east [[Kazakhstan]], in 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60811">'''Artificial general intelligence''' ('''AGI''') is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a [[human]] being can. It is a primary goal of some [[artificial intelligence]] research and a common topic in [[science fiction]] and [[Futures studies|future studies]]. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as "'''strong AI'''",&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] where he defines strong AI as "machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt; "'''full AI'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Age-of-Artificial-Intellige The Age of Artificial Intelligence: George John at TEDxLondonBusinessSchool 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; or as the ability of a machine to perform "general intelligent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}}. This is the term they use for "human-level" intelligence in the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic sources reserve "strong AI" to refer to machines capable of experiencing [[Chinese room#Strong AI|consciousness]].

Some references emphasize a distinction between strong AI and "applied AI"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219086/artificial-intelligence Strong AI, applied AI, and cognitive simulation] or Jack Copeland [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/www.AlanTuring.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/what_is_AI/What%20is%20AI02.html What is artificial intelligence?] on AlanTuring.net&lt;/ref&gt; (also called "narrow AI"&lt;ref name=K/&gt; or "[[weak AI]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/nextbigthing/ai/ai_in_depth/in_depth.htm The Open University on Strong and Weak AI]&lt;/ref&gt;): the use of software to study or accomplish specific [[problem solving]] or [[reason]]ing tasks. Weak AI, in contrast to strong AI, does not attempt to perform the full range of human [[cognitive]] abilities.

As of 2017, over forty organizations worldwide are doing active research on AGI.&lt;ref name=baum/&gt;

{{main|Cognitive science}}

Various criteria for [[intelligence]] have been proposed (most famously the [[Turing test]]) but to date, there is no definition that satisfies everyone.&lt;ref&gt;AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes: "we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent." {{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html |title=Basic Questions| last=McCarthy |first=John| authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist)| publisher=[[Stanford University]]| year=2007}} (For a discussion of some definitions of intelligence used by [[artificial intelligence]] researchers, see [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there ''is'' wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;
This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by major AI textbooks, including:
{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
{{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}},
{{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and
{{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[automated reasoning|reason]], use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under [[uncertainty]];
* [[knowledge representation|represent knowledge]], including [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]];
* [[automated planning and scheduling|plan]];
* [[machine learning|learn]];
* communicate in [[natural language processing|natural language]];
* and integrate all these skills towards common goals.

Other important capabilities include the ability to [[machine perception|sense]] (e.g. [[computer vision|see]]) and the ability to act (e.g. [[robotics|move and manipulate objects]]) in the world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, R. and Bongard J. C., How the body shapes the way we think: a new view of intelligence (The MIT Press, 2007). {{ISBN|0-262-16239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include an ability to detect and respond to [[hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = R. W. | year = 1959 | title = Motivation reconsidered: The concept of competence | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 66 | issue = 5| pages = 297–333 | doi=10.1037/h0040934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many interdisciplinary approaches to intelligence (e.g. [[cognitive science]], [[computational intelligence]] and [[decision making]]) tend to emphasise the need to consider additional traits such as [[imagination]] (taken as the ability to form mental images and concepts that were not programmed in)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Self-determination theory|autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;deCharms, R. (1968). Personal causation. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Computer based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities do exist (e.g. see [[computational creativity]], [[automated reasoning]], [[decision support system]], [[robot]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[intelligent agent]]), but not yet at human levels.

== Problems requiring AGI to solve ==
{{Main|AI-complete}}

The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as "AI-complete" or "AI-hard", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness. In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3–17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to repel [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford.

== Classical AI ==
{{Main|History of artificial intelligence}}
Modern AI research began in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of AI researchers was convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. As AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their predictions were the inspiration for [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s character [[HAL 9000]], who accurately embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. Of note is the fact that AI pioneer [[Marvin Minsky]] was a consultant&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two1.html Scientist on the Set: An Interview with Marvin Minsky]&lt;/ref&gt; on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time; Crevier quotes him as having said on the subject in 1967, "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved,"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky to {{Harvtxt|Darrach|1970}}, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Minsky states that he was misquoted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful "applied AI".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Lighthill report]] specifically criticized AI's "grandiose objectives" and led the dismantling of AI research in England. ({{Harvnb|Lighthill|1973}}; {{Harvnb|Howe|1994}}) In the U.S., [[DARPA]] became determined to fund only "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". See {{Harv|NRC|1999}} under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment". See also {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=115–117}} and {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1980s began, Japan's [[Fifth Generation Computer]] Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like "carry on a casual conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=211}}, {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=24}} and see also {{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|McCorduck|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and the success of [[expert systems]], both industry and government pumped money back into the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier| 1993|pp=161–162,197–203,240}}; {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}; {{harvnb|NRC|1999|loc=under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who had predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been shown to be fundamentally mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had gained a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all&lt;ref&gt;As AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes "it would be a great relief to the rest of the workers in AI if the inventors of new general formalisms would express their hopes in a more guarded form than has sometimes been the case." {{cite web| url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/reviews/lighthill/lighthill.html | title=Reply to Lighthill | last=McCarthy | first=John | authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) | publisher=Stanford University |year=2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid any mention of "human level" artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled "wild-eyed dreamer[s]."&lt;ref&gt;"At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |title=Behind Artificial Intelligence, a Squadron of Bright Real People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/14/technology/14artificial.html?ei=5070&amp;en=11ab55edb7cead5e&amp;ex=1185940800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1185805173-o7WsfW7qaP0x5/NUs1cQCQ |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current narrow AI research==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}

In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved far greater commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as [[artificial neural networks]], [[computer vision]] or [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "applied AI" systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is very heavily funded in both academia and industry.

Most mainstream AI researchers hope that strong AI can be developed by combining the programs that solve various sub-problems using an integrated [[agent architecture]], [[cognitive architecture]] or [[subsumption architecture]]. [[Hans Moravec]] wrote in 1988: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]] that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical [[golden spike]] is driven uniting the two efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even this fundamental philosophy has been disputed; for example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton concluded his 1990 paper on the [[Symbol grounding problem|Symbol Grounding Hypothesis]] by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The expectation has often been voiced that "top-down" (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet "bottom-up" (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Artificial general intelligence research==
Artificial general intelligence{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} (AGI) describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action. The term was introduced by Mark Gubrud in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.  The research objective is much older, for example [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]] project (that began in 1984), and [[Allen Newell]]'s [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] project are regarded as within the scope of AGI. AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and [[Ben Goertzel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goertzel|Wang|2006}}. See also {{harvtxt|Wang|2006}} with an up-to-date summary and lots of links.&lt;/ref&gt; as "producing publications and preliminary results". As yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

A 2017 survey of AGI categorized forty-five known "active R&amp;D projects" that explicitly or implicitly (through published research) research AGI, with the largest three being [[DeepMind]], the Human Brain Project, and OpenAI.&lt;ref name=baum&gt;Baum, Seth. "A Survey of Artificial General Intelligence Projects for Ethics, Risk, and Policy." (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing power needed to simulate a brain ==

===Whole brain emulation===
{{main|Mind uploading}}
A popular approach discussed to achieving general intelligent action is [[whole brain emulation]]. A low-level brain model is built by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer runs a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;
{{Harvnb|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}. "The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain."&lt;/ref&gt; Whole brain emulation is discussed in [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]], in the context of [[brain simulation]] for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.

===Early estimates ===
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; computations per second (cps).&lt;ref&gt;In "Mind Children" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cps is used. More recently, in 1997, &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&gt; Moravec argued for 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not "cps", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, if a "computation" was equivalent to one "[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]" –  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s – then 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; "computations" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.

===Modelling the neurons in more detail===
The [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently only understood in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Discover2011JanFeb"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia—the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan–Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current research===
There are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures. The [[Artificial Intelligence System]] project implemented non-real time simulations of a "brain" (with 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) in 2005. It took 50 days on a cluster of 27 processors to simulate 1 second of a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izhikevich |first=Eugene M. |last2=Edelman |first2=Gerald M. |date=March 4, 2008 |title=Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |journal=PNAS |publisher= |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=3593–3598 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0712231105|access-date=23 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612095651/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2009 |pmid=18292226 |pmc=2265160|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3593I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Brain]] project used one of the fastest supercomputer architectures in the world, [[IBM]]'s [[Blue Gene]] platform, to create a real time simulation of a single rat [[Neocortex|neocortical column]] consisting of approximately 10,000 neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer term goal is to build a detailed, functional simulation of the physiological processes in the human brain: "It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years," [[Henry Markram]], director of the Blue Brain Project said in 2009 at the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away' 2009 BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been controversial claims to have simulated a [[cat intelligence#Computer simulation of the cat brain|cat brain]]. Neuro-silicon interfaces have been proposed as an alternative implementation strategy that may scale better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/10343 University of Calgary news], [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12037941/ MSNBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Moravec]] addressed the above arguments ("brains are more complicated", "neurons have to be modeled in more detail") in his 1997 paper "When will computer hardware match the human brain?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He measured the ability of existing software to simulate the functionality of neural tissue, specifically the retina.  His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.

===Complications and criticisms of AI approaches based on simulation===
A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree&lt;/ref&gt; If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like [[Second Life]]), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.

Desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit "computations per second", see above) have been available since 2005. According to the brain power estimates used by Kurzweil (and Moravec), this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain, but despite some interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setiai.com/archives/cat_honey_bee_brain.html some links to bee brain studies]&lt;/ref&gt; no such simulation exists {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. There are at least three reasons for this:
* Firstly, the neuron model seems to be oversimplified (see next section).
* Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes{{refn|In Goertzels' AGI book ([[#CITEREFYudkowsky2006|Yudkowsky 2006]]), Yudkowsky proposes 5 levels of organisation that must be understood – code/data, sensory modality, concept &amp; category, thought, and deliberation (consciousness) – in order to use the available hardware}} to establish accurately what the brain's neural activity, observed using techniques such as [[Neuroimaging#Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging]], correlates with.
* Thirdly, even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently, early simulation programs are likely to be very inefficient and will, therefore, need considerably more hardware.
* Fourthly, the brain of an organism, while critical, may not be an appropriate boundary for a cognitive model.  To simulate a bee brain, it may be necessary to simulate the body, and the environment. [[The Extended Mind]] thesis formalizes the philosophical concept, and research into [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]] has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralized system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15829594 | doi=10.1152/jn.00684.2004 | volume=94 | issue=2 | title=Dynamic model of the octopus arm.

In addition, the scale of the human brain is not currently well-constrained. One estimate puts the human brain at about 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|Herrup|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-75525 "nervous system, human."] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 9 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate is 86 billion neurons of which 16.3 billion are in the [[cerebral cortex]] and 69 billion in the [[cerebellum]].{{sfn|Azevedo et al.|2009}} [[Glial cell]] synapses are currently unquantified but are known to be extremely numerous.

==Artificial consciousness research==
{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}

Although the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].

==Relationship to "strong AI"==
{{See also|philosophy of artificial intelligence|Chinese room}}

In 1980, philosopher [[John Searle]] coined the term "strong AI" as part of his [[Chinese room]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence:&lt;ref&gt;As defined in a standard AI textbook: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis." {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An artificial intelligence system can ''think'' and have a ''mind''.  (The word "mind" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in "the [[mind body problem]]" or "the [[philosophy of mind]]".)
* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.
The first one is called "the ''strong'' AI hypothesis" and the second is "the ''weak'' AI hypothesis" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the "strong AI hypothesis" as "strong AI". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;For example:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] (quoted in "High Beam Encyclopedia"),
* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] (quoted in "AITopics")
* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math]
* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] Anthony Tongen
&lt;/ref&gt;

The weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}

In contrast to Searle, Kurzweil uses the term "strong AI" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,&lt;ref name=K/&gt; regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.

==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==
{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}

Since the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

While most AI researchers believe that strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] that deny the possibility of achieving AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}

Conceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: "the framework starts from Weizenbaum’s observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

Furthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do {{Examples|date=September 2017}}.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem that is described by David Gelernter is that some people assume that thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}

The problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Other possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Clocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}

The practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}

A possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.

There have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, "No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion."{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.

==Consciousness==
There are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:
* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it "feels like" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask "what does it feel like to be a bat?" However, we are unlikely to ask "what does it feel like to be a toaster?" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.
* [[sentience]]: The ability to "feel" perceptions or emotions subjectively.
* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.
These traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. Also, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | magazine=Wired |date=April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.

In science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to philosopher [[John Searle]], it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. "Strong AI" (as defined above by [[Ray Kurzweil]]) should not be confused with Searle's "'[[strong AI hypothesis]]". The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.

==Controversies and dangers==

===Feasibility===
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". However, this prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require "unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs" and a "scientifically deep understanding of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Paul|title=The Singularity Isn't Near|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[The Guardian]], roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI experts' views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when they'd be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. It is also interesting to note 16.5% of the experts answered with "never" when asked the same question but with a 90% confidence instead.&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raffi Khatchadourian|title=The Doomsday Invention: Will artificial intelligence bring us utopia or destruction?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V.

===Potential threat to human existence{{anchor|Risk_of_human_extinction}}===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{See also|Technological singularity}}

The creation of artificial general intelligence may have repercussions so great and so complex that it may not be possible to forecast what will come afterwards.  Thus the event in the hypothetical future of achieving strong AI is called the [[technological singularity]], because theoretically one cannot see past it.  But this has not stopped philosophers and researchers from guessing what the smart computers or robots of the future may do, including forming a utopia by [[friendly artificial intelligence|being our friends]] or overwhelming us in an [[AI takeover]]. The latter potentiality is particularly disturbing as it poses an [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk for mankind]].

==== Self-replicating machines ====
Smart computers or robots would be able to design and produce improved versions of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Hein, Andreas Makoto, and Hélène Condat. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02091 "Can Machines Design? An Artificial General Intelligence Approach."] arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02091 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; A growing population of intelligent robots could conceivably out-compete inferior humans in job markets, in business, in science, in politics (pursuing [[robot rights]]), and technologically, sociologically ([[Group mind (science fiction)|by acting as one]]), and militarily.

==== Emergent superintelligence ====
If research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself – a feature called "recursive self-improvement". It would then be even better at improving itself, and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to an [[intelligence explosion]] and the emergence of [[superintelligence]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and might be able to invent or discover almost anything.

Hyper-intelligent software might not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and might be extremely difficult to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Yudkowsky, Eliezer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of [[risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth]].

One proposal to deal with this is to make sure that the first generally intelligent AI is a [[friendly AI]] that would then endeavor to ensure that subsequently developed AIs were also nice to us. But friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI, and therefore it is likely, in a race between the two, that non-friendly AI would be developed first. Also, there is no guarantee that friendly AI would remain friendly, or that its progeny would also all be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audience''' was an American mobile voice and audio-processing company based in [[Mountain View, CA|Mountain View]], [[California]], and was one of the 34 founding members of [[Open Handset Alliance|The Open Handset Alliance]]. They specialized in improving voice clarity and noise suppression for a broad range of consumer products, including [[cellular phones]], [[mobile device]]s and [[Personal computer|PC]]s. They were bought by Knowles for $85 Million in 3Q15 who changed their name to Knowles Intelligent Audio.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326532&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience was the first company to have reverse-engineered the human hearing system and model its processes onto a chip, enabling computers and mobile devices to use the same kind of “auditory intelligence” that humans employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audience.com/component/zoo/item/audience-announces-next-generation-voice-processor-for-mobile-phones |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221701/http://www.audience.com/component/zoo/item/audience-announces-next-generation-voice-processor-for-mobile-phones |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using this technology in conjunction with two or more microphones, background noise is suppressed, improving the quality of the remaining voice and reducing distraction for the listener.&lt;ref&gt;http://phandroid.com/2010/01/11/nexus-one-voice-quality-victory-via-audience-a1026-voice-processor/&lt;/ref&gt; This technology mimics the “[[cocktail party effect]]”.

In 2010, Audience partnered with [[HTC]] to integrate their noise suppression technology into the Google [[Nexus One]] smartphone. The next year [[AT&amp;T]] introduced eight different handsets powered by Audience's earSmart technology including the [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Samsung Galaxy S III Skyrocket]] and the [[HTC Vivid]].

In 2013, [https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/audience-es515/ Audience unveiled its eS515], a combination voice processor and audio codec. This single slot solution enables device manufacturers to streamline their designs, negating the need for a separate voice processor and codec.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/show/6554/audience-announces-3rd-generation-sound-processor-es515&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The company’s core technology reduces background noise and [http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/120043-samsung-galaxy-s4-features-explored improves voice clarity on smartphones], computers and tablets. The company’s technology has shipped in more than 140 devices including the Nexus One, [[Samsung Galaxy]] S, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note, the iPhone4 and 4S, and the LG G2. Audience also works with other mobile phone manufacturers such as Huawei, Google, HTC, Sharp, Pantech, ZTE and others. In 2010, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131101154321/http://audience.com/news/press-releases/item/audience-brings-advanced-audio-noise-suppression-to-att-mobile-devices the company announced a collaboration with AT&amp;T] to deliver its advanced voice capabilities to AT&amp;T devices and is engaged with multiple operators around the world. Most recently the company announced its first design implementation in the PC space with the [http://technoodling.net/dell-vostro-5460-launched-an-ultrabook-with-2gb-nvidia-graphics-for-36k/ Dell Vostro 5460.]

==Products  ==

They had two lines of processors, Advanced Voice  and Smart Sound, both branded as [http://audience.com/products/what-is-earsmart "earSmart."] Advanced Voice processors come in a variety of models, the eS110 (supports 1 microphone), eS305 and eS310 (supports 2 microphones) and the company’s latest generation eS325 (supports 3 microphones), which was announced at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2013.

Smart Sound processors combined the Advanced Voice processor feature set (HD call quality, wideband noise suppression, bandwidth expansion, acoustic echo cancelation, and improved performance for Automatic Speech Recognition) with a stereo audio codec. The company introduced its Smart Sound processor category at Consumer Electronics Show 2013 with the launch of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140121035454/http://audience.com/press-releases/item/audience-introduces-the-earsmart-es515-the-world-s-first-smart-sound-processor eS515].

==Technology==

The company’s technology was built around the foundation of [[Computational auditory scene analysis|Computational Auditory Scene Analysis]] (CASA) -- a field of study that builds on the concept of [[Auditory scene analysis|Auditory Scene Analysis]] (ASA), a term first coined by psychologist [[Albert Bregman]]. ASA enables humans to accurately group sounds—even when composed of multiple frequencies, as in music, or when heard simultaneously –- and avoid blending "sources." As a result, ASA allows the listener to correctly distinguish and identify a sound of interest, like a voice, from other noise sources.

CASA attempts to recreate sound source separation in the same manner as human hearing, but in machines. Using the principles of CASA, Audience’s earSmart processors act like a human [[cochlea]] and group different sounds, based on a diverse list of cues such as pitch, onset/offset time, spatial location and harmonicity.   These simultaneous sounds are evaluated and grouped by source. In doing this, the microphones of a mobile device, together with Audience's proprietary "Fast Cochlea Transform" technology, can identify and group sounds which are classified as noise, remove or at least reduce them, and leave the remaining clear voice signal intact.

==Applications==

Beyond voice and video calls, this technology has been proven to improve the reliability and task completion rate of ASR (automatic speech recognition) in noisy environments as well as improve the quality and usability of media capture functions. Outside of the smartphone, tablet and mobile PC space, [http://seekingalpha.com/article/901351-audience-trading-at-cash-value Audience is said to be targeting the Smart TV and Automotive markets where voice is becoming more commonplace as a form of user interface].

==Awards==
Audience was the Silver Winner in the 2008 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Awards and the Winner of the Semiconductor category.  The company was included in Gartner’s “Cool Vendors in Semiconductors, 2008” and selected as the Most Innovative True Mobile Start-Up for the “2008 GSMA Mobile Innovation Global Awards.”

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

Fisk then hit a pitch down the left field line that appeared to be heading to foul territory. The enduring image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is arguably one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7-6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic. During this time, cameramen covering baseball games were instructed to follow the flight of the ball; reportedly, Fisk's reaction&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=Mutual+Broadcasting+System+Major+League+Baseball&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=www.baseball-fever.com/archive/index.php/t-17096.html&amp;w=mutual+broadcasting+system+systems+major+majors+league+baseball&amp;d=F82G8OdmPcCb&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us In 1975 baseball announced a new kind of TV deal.

Dual network coverage also brought an element of competition without economic overtones-quality of coverage. Then came October 21, 1975.

But a three-run pinch-hit homer by Bernie Carbo tied the game in the eighth, and in the twelfth (by then it was 12:34 a.m.) Carlton Fisk hit a solo shot over the "Green Monster" to win the game. Sixty-two million people saw it, and television couldn't have planned it better, because as Fisk hit his homer, the camera in the left field scoreboard followed him, not the ball, and on replay the audience saw Fisk furiously trying to wave the ball fair. It was the first-ever home run reaction shot. The next night, 75,890,000 people watched the seventh game, and baseball was definitely back. In 1976 baseball received revenue from radio and television approaching $51 million. Lou Harris said in 1977, "For the first time since 1968, more sports fans in the country follow baseball than football." Ten years later baseball received $350 million.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was only being recorded because [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] cameraman Lou Gerard, positioned inside Fenway's scoreboard at the base of the left-field [[Green Monster]] wall, had become distracted by a large rat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lowitt]], "Rats!

[[Dave Phillips (umpire)|Dave Phillips]], the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want ''"CBS to be fair with their approach."''

Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]]' [[Ricky Jordan]] out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6&amp;nbsp;inches outside.

Unlike Fox, TBS did not bludgeon the audience with an overabundance of crowd shots or fan interviews. Much of the camera work was exceptional. The close-ups of insects feasting on the neck of Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain were so creepy that they could have been filmed by Wes Craven. For the most part, TBS did a nice job of letting the pictures work for them. Some of the graphics proved problematic, though. As SI's Tom Verducci pointed out, the Leadoff Line, the nine-foot arrow that measured the lead a runner gets off first base, overtly gimmicky and intrusive. Some SI.com readers complained that the graphic at the top of the screen showing how many runners were on base was too small. (To its credit, Behnke said that TBS adjusted it prior to the final game of the Indians-Yankees series by deepening the border and edgings.) Look for the same graphics to return for the LCS -- the Leadoff Line is sponsored by Travelers, not that most fans would know -- including the addition of microphones placed in the bases. "It's always a work in progress and we are our own worst critics," said Behnke, who averaged four hours of sleep during the Division Series. "We have this package for many years but I would say this: We are overwhelmingly deeply proud of what we have done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we crank it up on Thursday."]&lt;/ref&gt; debuted various new looks, such as the first live online views from cameras in dugouts and ones focused on pitchers. TBS also introduced a graphic that creates sort of a rainbow to trace the arc of pitches on game replays. The graphic was superimposed in the studio so analysts like [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] for instance, could take virtual cuts at pitches thrown in games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-10-01-hiestand-weekend_N.htm "He'll be standing at a home plate with a bat," Behnke says.

[[File:Blob Birmingham.jpg|thumb|The [[Selfridges]] building ("The Blob") in [[Birmingham]] by architect Jan Kaplicky of [[Future Systems]]]]

A '''blobject''' is a design product, often a household object, distinguished by smooth flowing curves, bright colors, and an absence of sharp edges. The word is generally held to be a [[portmanteau]], a contraction of "blob" and "object."

The origin of the term is disputed, but it is often attributed to either the designer-author Steven Skov Holt&lt;ref name="Skov"&gt;[http://www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/sholt CA College of the Arts Bio on Steven Skov Holt]&lt;/ref&gt; or the designer [[Karim Rashid]].  Author and design journalist Phil Patton&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=23367 Random House Bio of Phil Patton]&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the word to Holt in 1993 in [[Esquire magazine]]. Holt has defined a blobject as, most often, a colorful, [[mass-produced]], [[plastic]]-based, emotionally engaging [[consumer product]] with a curvilinear, flowing shape.  This fluid and curvaceous form is the blobject's most distinctive feature. Rashid, the contemporary designer who wrote the book ''I want to Change the World,'' was an early leader in creating blobjects and has become one of the most celebrated designers of his generation.

Blobjects can also be found in most areas of contemporary [[visual culture]]. 
* A blobject can be a typographic font (cf. [[Neville Brody]]), an animation (cf. Monica Peon), a piece of furniture ([[Marc Newson]]), an article of clothing ([[Rei Kawakubo]]), a motorcycle (GK Dynamics), a car (GEMCAR), a building ([[Future Systems]]), a painting ([[Rex Ray]]), a piece of sculpture (Hadeki Matsumoto), or ceramics work (Ken Price).
* Blobjects can be made of any material in any size or scale for the home, office, car, or outdoors.
Common materials used in fabricating blobjects are plastic (especially [[polycarbonate]], [[polypropylene]], or [[polyethylene]]), [[metal]], and [[rubber]], with the aim being to give a more organic and animate feel. 

The blobject trend has largely been driven by advances in [[computer-aided design]], [[information visualization]], [[rapid prototyping]], [[materials science|materials]], and [[injection molding]]. These technologies have given designers the chance to use new shapes and to explore transparency and translucency without significant extra production costs.

More recently, in 2004, author [[Bruce Sterling]] used the word in the title of his keynote speech at Siggraph.&lt;ref name="BlobjectsRule"&gt;[http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/media/releases/release6.php?pageID=media Siggraph 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his speech titled, "When Blobjects Rule the Earth", Sterling speculated on the future of graphic simulation when practical differences no longer exist between computer generated models and physically manufactured objects.

The '''Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs''' ('''OES''') is a bureau within the [[United States Department of State]]. It coordinates a portfolio of issues related to the world's oceans, environment, science and technology, and health.

==Overview==

The Bureau is headed by the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]].  As of April 2014, it is headed by acting Assistant Secretary [[Judith G. Garber|Judith Garber]]. 

The Oceans and Fisheries Directorate has two offices dedicated to international oceans issues. The Office of Marine Conservation focuses on international [[Fishery|fisheries]] matters and related problems and the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs has primary responsibility for [[Law of the sea|international ocean law]] and policy, [[marine pollution]], [[marine mammals]], polar affairs, [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]], and [[marine science]].  It is headed by  Deputy Assistant Secretary David A. Balton.

The Environment Directorate deals with environmental issues including environmental aspects of international trade and safeguarding hazardous materials requiring multilateral agreements within the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Affairs. The Office of Conservation and Water develops U.S. foreign policy approaches to conserving and managing the world [[ecosystem]]s and to transboundary water issues.  The Environment Directorate is headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Daniel Reifsnyder. 

The Health, Space and Science Directorate includes the Office of International Health Affairs which works with U.S. Government agencies to facilitate policy-making regarding international [[bioterrorism]], [[infectious disease]], surveillance and response, [[environmental health]], and health in post-conflict situations. The Office of Space and Advanced Technology handles issues arising from our [[Space exploration|exploration of space]] to assure global security regarding this new frontier, and the Office of Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Cooperation promotes the interests of the U.S. [[Scientific community|science]] and technology communities in the international policy arena, negotiates framework and other S&amp;T agreements, manages the Department's Embassy Science fellows program, and takes a leading role in representing U.S. science and technology in multilateral international organizations, such as [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] and other [[United Nations|UN]] organizations, [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and others. The Health, Space and Science Directorate is headed by acting Deputy Assistant Secretary Jonathan Margolis.

Complexity theory is an interdisciplinary theory that grew out of [[systems theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"/&gt; Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-02" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, [[Chaos theory|chaos]], and [[self-similarity]].&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2379/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.  In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;

== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complimentary and co-dependent.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt;

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS, is Wikipedia&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-18" /&gt; By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries&lt;!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed---&gt;; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es&lt;!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed---&gt;; and any human social group-based endeavour in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.&lt;ref name="GT-33" /&gt;  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behaviour in terms of its constituent parts; as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;

'''''Connections''''' is a 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary]] television series and 1978 book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]. The series was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] of the [[BBC]] Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the [[history of science]] and [[invention]], and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and [[deadpan|dry humour]]), [[historical re-enactment]]s, and intricate working [[scale model|models]].

The popular success of the series led to the production of ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997), both for [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. In 2004, [[KPJK|KCSM-TV]] produced a program called ''Re-Connections'', consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content==
[[File:Pike Square.JPG|thumb|Modern soldiers demonstrate the use of steel-tipped [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] against [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] in one of the many re-enactments used in ''Connections''.]]
''Connections'' explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and [[teleology|teleological]] view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

To demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[middle ages|medieval times]]) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode "The Long Chain" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the [[fluyt]], a type of Dutch [[cargo ship]].

Burke also explores three [[corollary|corollaries]] to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, [[Future shock|becomes too much for the average person]] to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

Lastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] or the funding of controversial projects such as [[stem cell]] research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?

The 1978 Connections companion book was published about the time the middle of the series was airing, so likely was written in parallel to the series and had a post-production editing release.&lt;ref&gt;This is not the ISBN of the original 1978 book, but those available online March 2017 via used book web sites {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions.  Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes.  It can be found in many libraries.

The segment ends in [[Kuwait]] where, because of [[Crude oil|oil]], society leapt from traditional patterns to advanced technology in a period of only about 30 years.
# "Death in the Morning" examines the standardisation of precious metal with the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from [[Greece]] to [[Persia]], ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and [[library at Alexandria]] which included [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Star catalogue|star table]]s. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators during the [[age of discovery]] 14 centuries later following the introduction of [[lateen sail]]s and [[sternpost rudder]]s. Mariners discovered that the [[compass]]'s magnetised needle did not actually point directly north. Investigations into the nature of [[magnetism]] by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Gilbert]] led to the discovery of electricity by way of the [[Electrostatic generator|sulphur ball]] of [[von Guericke]]. Further interest in [[atmospheric electricity]] at the [[Ben Nevis]] [[weather station]] led to [[C. T. R. Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[cloud chamber]] which in turn allowed development of both [[Robert Watson-Watt|Watson-Watt]]'s [[radar]] and (by way of [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s insights) [[nuclear weaponry]].
# "Distant Voices" suggests that telecommunications exist because [[Normans]] had [[stirrups]] for horse riding which in turn led them to further advancements in warfare. Deep mine shafts flooded and scientists in search of a solution examined [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuums]], air pressure, and other natural phenomena.
# "Faith in Numbers" examines the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] from the perspective of how commercialism, [[climate change]], and the [[Black Death]] influenced cultural development. He examines the impact of [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] waterpower on the Industrial Revolution, derived from [[Roman watermill]] technology such as that of the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]]. Also covered are the Gutenberg printing press, the [[Jacquard loom]], and the Hollerith punch card tabulator that led to modern computer programming.
# "The Wheel of Fortune" traces [[astrological]] knowledge in ancient Greek manuscripts from [[Baghdad]]'s founder, Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], via the Muslim monastery/medical school at [[Gundeshapur]], to the medieval Church's need for alarm clocks (the [[water clock|water horologium]] and the [[verge and foliot]] clock). The clock [[mainspring]] gave way to the [[pendulum clock]], but the latter could not be used by mariners, thus the need for [[Machine tool|precision machining]] by way of [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s improved steel (1797) and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s use (1800) of [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]]'s idea of using a screw to better measure (which he took from the [[Polelathe|turner]]'s trade). This process made a better mainspring and was also used by the Royal Navy to make better [[Block (sailing)|blocks]]. [[Honoré Blanc|Le Blanc]] mentioned this same basic idea to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who transmitted this "[[American system of manufacturing|American system of manufactures]]" – precision machine-tooling of [[musket]] parts for interchangeability – to New Englanders [[Eli Whitney]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]], and [[Simeon North]]. The American efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and his [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|psychologist wife]] later improved the whole new system of the modern [[production line]].
# "Thunder in the Skies" implicates the [[Little Ice Age]] (''[[circa]]'' 1300-1850 AD) in the invention of the [[chimney]], as well as [[knitting]], [[button]]s, [[wainscoting]], [[Tapestry|wall tapestries]], [[Plasterwork|wall plastering]], [[glass window]]s ([[Hardwick Hall]] [1597] has "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the [[steam engine]] is then examined: [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[Newcomen engine|engine]] for pumping water out of mines (1712); [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby]]'s cheap iron from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[James Watt]]'s addition of a second [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensing cylinder]] (for cooling) to the engine (1763); [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773–75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, [[Joseph Priestley]], investigated gases, leading [[Alessandro Volta]] to invent "bad air" ([[marsh gas]]) detectors and ignitors. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Drake]] discovered oil (in [[Pennsylvania]]), allowing [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] (in [[Bad Cannstatt]]) to replace [[town gas]] with gasoline as fuel for [[Siegfried Marcus|auto engine]]s (1883). They also invented (in 1892) the [[carburetor]] (inspired by the medical [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizers]], which also developed from Priestley's work) and a new ignition system inspired by Volta's "bad air" detection spark gun. Finally, piano-maker [[Wilhelm Kress]] unsuccessfully attempted (1901) to fly the first [[seaplane]] on an Austrian lake using the new gasoline engine.
# "The Long Chain" traces the invention of the [[fluyt]] freighter in Holland in the 16th century. Voyages were insured by Edward Lloyd ([[Lloyd's of London]]) if the ships' hulls were covered in pitch and tar (which came from the colonies until the American War of Independence in 1776). In [[Culross]], Scotland, [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald Cochrane (9th Earl of Dundonald)]] tried to [[coal gasification|distill coal vapour]] to get [[coal tar]] for ships' hulls, which led to the discovery of [[ammonia]]. The search for artificial [[quinine]] to treat malaria led to the development of artificial dyes, which Germany used to produce fertilizers to grow wheat and led to the advancement of chemistry which in turn led to [[DuPont]]'s discovery of polymers such as nylon.
# "Eat, Drink and Be Merry..." begins with plastic, the plastic credit card, and the concept of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], then leaps back to the time of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the first state to use credit. The [[Dukes of Burgundy|dukes]] used credit for many luxuries, and to buy more armour for a stronger army. The Swiss opposed the army of Burgundy and invented a new military formation (with [[Swiss pikemen|soldiers using pikes]]) called the [[pike square]]. The pike square, along with events following the French Revolution, set in motion the growth in the size of armies and in the use of ill-trained peasant soldiers. Feeding these large armies became a problem for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], which caused the innovation of bottled food. The bottled food was first put in champagne bottles then in tin cans. [[Canned food]] was used for armies and for navies. In one of the bottles, the canned food went bad, and people blamed the spoiled food on "bad air", also known as swamp air. Investigations around "bad air" and malaria led to the innovation of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]]. In 1892, [[Sir James Dewar]] invented a container that could keep liquids hot or cold (the [[thermos]]) which led three men – [[Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], and [[Hermann Oberth]] – to construct a large thermal flask for either [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]] or for [[solid fuel]] combustion for use in [[rocket propulsion]], applying the thermal flask principle to keep [[rocket fuel]] cold and successfully using it for the [[V-2]] rocket and the [[Saturn V rocket]] that put man on the moon.
# "Countdown" connects the invention of the [[movie projector]] to improvements in castle fortifications caused by the invention and use of the [[cannon]]. The use of the cannon caused changes in castle fortifications to eliminate a blind spot where cannon fire could not reach. This improvement in castle defence caused innovation in offensive cannon fire, which eventually required [[map]]s. Thus, a need arose to view and map locations (like a mountain top) from a long distance, which led to the invention of [[limelight]] light source, and later the [[incandescent light]]. Burke turns to the next ingredient for a movie projector, [[Photographic film|film]]. Film is made with [[celluloid]] (made with [[guncotton]]) which was first invented as a substitute for ivory in [[billiard balls]]. Next was the invention of the [[zoopraxiscope]] which was first used for a bet to see if a horse's hooves all left the ground at any point while galloping. The zoopraxiscope used frame-by-frame pictures and holes on the side to allow the machine to pull the film forward. Communication signals for railways using [[Samuel Morse|Morse]]'s telegraph led to [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] discovering how to speak into a microphone creating bumps on a disc that could be played back—the [[phonograph|record player]]. This final ingredient gave [[Sound film|movies sound]]. In summary, Burke connects the invention of the movie projector to four major innovations in history: the incandescent light, the discovery of celluloid, the projector that uses frame-by-frame pictures on celluloid, and finally, recorded sound.
# "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" recaps the theme that change causes more change. Burke ties together the modern inventions in which previous episodes had culminated: telecommunications, the computer, the jet engine, plastics, rockets, television, the production line, and the atomic bomb. All of these inventions come together in the B-52 nuclear bomber. Start with the plow, you get [[irrigation]], [[pottery]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], [[civilisation]] and writing, mathematics, a [[calendar]] to predict floods, empires, and a [[modern world]] where change happens so rapidly you cannot keep up. What do you do? Stop the change? Throw away all technology and live like cavemen? Decide what change will be allowed by law? Or just accept that the world is changing faster than we can keep up with?

===''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994)===
# "Revolutions" – What do all these things have in common—three grandfathers' lifetimes, two revolutions, 1750 [[Cornish steam engine]]s for Cornwall's tin mines, water in mines, [[pumps]], [[steam engines]], [[James Watt|Watt]]'s copier, [[carbon paper]], [[match]]es, phosphorus [[fertiliser]], trains and [[Gene pool|gene-pool]] mixing, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], 24-hour production, educated women, the telephone, high-rise buildings, [[Damascus steel|Damascus]]'s [[sword]]s, steel, diamond, [[carborundum]], [[graphite]], [[oscilloscope]], television, [[Apollo space program]], [[X-ray]] [[crystallography]], [[DNA]] and [[gene therapy]]? You will learn these things in the first episode of Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, "Revolutions".
# "Sentimental Journeys" – What do these have in common – [[Freud]], lifestyle crisis, [[electric shock therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[magnetism]], [[phrenology]], [[penology]], [[physiology]], [[synthetic dyes]], the [[Bunsen burner]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Fraunhofer lines]], [[astronomical telescope]]s, [[chromatic aberrations]], and [[surveying]]? Follow James Burke on the trail of discovering the connections between these and others in "Sentimental Journeys".
# "Getting it Together" – James Burke explains the relationship between [[hot air balloons]] and [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]], and goes on to surgery, hydraulic-water gardens, [[hydraulic rams]], [[Alpine Tunnel|tunnelling through the Alps]], the [[Orient Express]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[heart attacks]] and [[headaches]], [[aspirin]], [[carbolic acid]], [[disinfectants]], [[Maybach]]-[[Gottlieb Daimler]]-[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], [[carburetors]], [[helicopters]], [[typewriters]], [[punch cards]], and [[IBM]].
# "Whodunit?" – This episode starts with a [[billiard ball]] and ends with a billiard ball. Along the way, Burke examines [[Georgius Agricola]]'s ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', how mining supported war, the role of money, the [[Spanish Armada]], large ships, problems posed by a wood shortage, [[glass making]], coal, [[plate glass]], [[mirror]]s, the [[sextant]], the discovery of [[granite]], and seashells in the mountains, which enabled a new view of the [[age of the earth]], and [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], [[Francis Galton]]'s ''[[Eugenics]]'', and the [[fingerprinting|forensic use of fingerprints]].
# "Something for Nothing" – How do [[space shuttle]] landings start with the [[vacuum]] which was [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|forbidden by the Church]]? Burke takes us on an adventure with barometers, [[weather forecasting]], muddy and blacktop roads, rain [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[sewage]], a [[cholera]] epidemic, [[hygiene]], [[plumbing]], [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[vacuum pump]]s, [[Drill#Types|compressed-air drills]], tunnels in the Alps, [[railway air brake|train air brakes]], [[hydroelectric power]], the [[electric motor]], [[Galvani]]'s [[Muscle electrostimulation#History|muscle-electricity connection]], [[Alessandro Volta#First battery|Volta's battery]], and [[gyroscopes]].
# "Echoes of the Past" – The past in this case starts with the [[Indian tea culture#Dutch exploration|tea in Dutch-ruled India]], examines the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[porcelain]], the architecture of Florence, [[Delftware]], [[Wedgwood]], [[Free Masons]], [[Cryptography|secret codes]], [[radiotelephone|radio-telephones]], [[cosmic background radiation]] and—finally – [[radio astronomy]], which listens to "Echoes of the Past".
# "Photo Finish" – Another series of discoveries examined by Burke includes [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], the [[disappearing elephant scare of 1867]], billiard balls, [[celluloid]] as a substitute for ivory, false teeth that explode, [[gun cotton]], double shot sound of a bullet, [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[shock wave]], [[aerodynamics]], [[nuclear bombs]], [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativity]], Einstein's selenium, [[talkies|movie talkies]], the [[valve audio amplifier|vacuum tube amplifier]], radio, [[Railroad#History|railroad's use of wood]], [[coal tar]], [[gas lighting|gas lights]], [[creosote]], rubber, the [[Zeppelin]], the [[automobile]], and finally how Adeline [[Vulcanization|vulcanise]]s tires.
# "Separate Ways" – Burke shows how to get from sugar to [[atomic weapons]] by two totally independent paths. The first involves [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]], [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist societies]], [[Sampson Lloyd II]], [[wire]], [[suspension bridges]], [[Galvanization#Zinc coatings|galvanised wire]], settlement of the [[Wild West]], [[barbed wire]], canned corn, and [[cadmium]]. The second path involves [[sweet tea]], [[rum]], a [[double boiler]], the steam engine, [[Matthew Boulton]], English currency, the [[pantograph]], [[electroplating]], and [[cathode ray tubes]].
# "High Times" – The connection between [[polyethylene]] and [[Big Ben]] is a few degrees of separation, so let us recount them: polyethylene, [[radar]], soap, artificial dyes, [[color perception]], [[tapestries]], Far East goods, fake lacquer furniture, search for shorter route to Japan, [[Henry Hudson#1607 and 1608 voyages|Hudson in Greenland]], the discovery of plentiful whales, printing the Bible, [[Mercator map]], [[Martin Luther]]'s protest, star tables, Earth as a flattened sphere, and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]'s clock which of course leads to Big Ben.
# "Deja Vu" – James Burke provides evidence that history does repeat itself by examining the likes of [[black and white movie]]s, [[conquistadors]], [[Incas|Peruvian Incas]], [[small pox]], settlements that look like Spain's cities, the gold abundance ending up in [[Belgium]], Antwerp, colony [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], the practice of [[buried treasure|burying treasure]] to avoid pirates, [[Port Royal]]'s pirates, earthquakes, the [[College of William and Mary]], [[military discipline]], [[Alexander Humboldt]]'s observation on the environment, [[Ratzel]]'s superstate ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and [[Karl Haushofer|Haushofer]]'s world domination.
# "New Harmony" – A dream of utopia is followed from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] to Singapore, from the [[transistor]] to its most important element, [[germanium]], to [[Ming vase]]s and cobalt fakes (which contribute to the blue in blue tiles used in special Islamic places), and [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics in Byzantium]], the [[donation of Constantine]], [[Portuguese discoveries#Celestial navigation|Portuguese navigation by stars]], the [[History of Brazil#Beginnings of Brazil|"discovery" of Brazil]], [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|Holland's tolerance]], diamond merchants, [[optics]], [[microscopes]], beasts of science, [[Frankenstein's monster]], and finally [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony.]]
# "Hot Pickle" – Burke starts out in a [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|spice market in Istanbul]] where you can find hot pickle, recounts the [[Byzantium#History|taking of Constantinople by the Turks]] in 1453, follows the trail of pepper, tea, and [[opium]] and the exploitation of addicts, moves to the jungles of [[Java]], then to [[zoos]], the [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|use of canaries]] as carbon monoxide detectors, how [[George Stephenson]] used his consolation prize to build a [[locomotive]], which led to the [[Monitor and Merrimack|battle between the'' Monitor'' and the ''Merrimack'']]. Next we visit a sea island off the coast of South Carolina, where children of slaves are schooled. By the way, they picked cotton, which leads us to [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and [[air conditioning]]. [[Georgia Cayvan]]'s glass dress leads to the [[Neodymium laser|neodymium glass laser]], (which was used in the [[Gulf War]]). And the armed switch for firing a missile is also called a "hot pickle".
# "The Big Spin" is what [[The Big Spin|California's lottery TV show]] is called. And lottery being a game of chance, from here Burke takes us through [[Alexander Fleming]]'s chance discovery of [[penicillin]], to [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s observation that contaminated water is related to health, to [[Schliemann]]'s search for the [[City of Troy]], the theft of a discovered treasure, and to Virchow's criminology. From there we proceed to [[anthropology]], the classification of life forms, [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Mortality rate|statistics of mortality]], [[life expectancy]], [[Statistics#Statistical methods|statistical math]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]'s [[carbonated water]], the [[soda fountain]], [[petroleum oil]], some French fossil hunters, [[seismology]], and impossible-to-predict earthquakes.
# "Bright Ideas" – [[gin and tonic]] was invented to combat malaria in [[British colonies]] like [[Java]], which leads us to [[Geneva]], where cleanliness is an obsession. Here, [[tonic water]] was sealed with a disposable bottle cap, and [[disposable razor|razors became disposable]], leading us to [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s steel, invaluable for making [[clock]] springs. We take a little trip through [[lighthouses]], the education of orphans, [[psycho-physics]], the law of the [[just noticeable difference]], which is the idea behind [[stellar magnitude]]s, which leads us to discovering the [[size of the universe]].
# "Making Waves" – a [[permanent wave]] in ladies' hair is aided by [[curlers]], and this leads us to explore [[borax]], taking us to Switzerland, [[Johann Sutter]]'s scam, and [[Sutter's Mill]], and that means the discovery of gold leading to the 1848 [[California gold rush]]. Americans then cut into the English tea market with the aide of the ''[[Clipper|Yankee Clipper]]'', which played a big role in the gold rush. A fungus from America created the [[Irish potato famine]], resulting in the importing of corn, but laws prevented the Yankee clippers from being used until it was too late to save Ireland. Finally, the laws were changed, leading to franking fraud, which was overcome by special printing of postage stamps, which gave us [[wallpaper]], and a thickening agent, leading us to the [[Canal du Midi]], the [[American War of Independence|American war for independence]], resettlement in Scotland, [[Highland Clearances|highlanders]] in Nova Scotia and—finally—the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].
# "Routes" – [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], a sick English lawyer, recuperates sipping wine and contributes the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] to help fix farming problems. Farm production is not going so well in France, either. [[François Quesnay]] (doctor of King Louis XV's mistress) suggests a solution based on his complete misunderstanding of English farming techniques. ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' was his erroneous idea. It also got the people to demand social ''laissez-faire''. His inciting the public's rebellion against the [[French monarchy|monarchy]] led to France's invasion of Geneva. The [[French Revolution]] led to personal exploration of the senses. Berlin doctor Müller reasoned that each sense does a different job and the nervous system analyses what the senses are telling one. Helmholtz's pupil, Hertz, discovered that sound and electricity have a wave-like nature in common. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] takes this a step further by sending and receiving signals very long distances across the earth. The [[BBC]] realised that the radio waves were reflected by the ionosphere, and Hess was the first to suggest that the ionization was due to "Hess rays" later related to solar activity. But [[World War II]] started and [[adding machines]] were needed to aim artillery, so [[digital computing]] was invented. Thus was enabled the [[GPS]] which tells travelers their "Routes".
# "One Word" – The one word that changed everything was "[[filioque]]", but we must make a trip to [[Constantinople]], visit the [[Renaissance]], meet [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]], explore [[abbreviations]], learn about [[Italic type|Italic print]], which resulted in an overload of books, requiring the development of a cataloguing system, which was complicated for those seeking education, where [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] was innovating with pictorial textbooks. And that brings us to church intolerance, [[James Watt]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[cerium]], the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Gauss's mathematics, and [[cultural anthropology]].
# "Sign Here" – [[Murphy's Law]] says you need insurance from [[Lloyd's of London]], so pack your bags to study [[international law]] and protect yourself from piracy by calculating the probability. You better study Pascal's math for that, but you might find yourself jailed for [[free thinking]]. While you are in jail, study some [[sign language]], or at least learn to speak better than [[Eliza Doolittle]]. [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]]'s waveform recordings lead you to the telephone, the invention of [[shorthand]], the [[radiometer]], gas flow, the [[Wright brothers]]' aeroplane, [[lubrication]], [[ball bearings]] and a [[ballpoint pen]] so you can "Sign Here".
# "Better Than the Real Thing"  starts in the 1890s with bicycles and [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and then takes a look at [[boots]], [[zippers]], [[sewing machines]], and infinitesimal difference. Speaking of small, we look at microscopic [[Microorganism|germs]], [[polarized light]], sugar, coal, iron, microbubbles, the [[spectroscope]], [[night vision]], [[beriberi]] resulting from [[polished rice]], chickens, war rationing, and finally, we arrive at [[Vitamin pill|vitamins in a pill]].
# "Flexible Response" is a whimsical look at the myth of the [[English longbow]], [[Robin Hood]], sheep, the need to drain land with [[windmills]], the effect of [[compound interest]], [[decimal fractions]] (wrongly pointing to the USA not Russia as the first country with [[decimal currency]], in fact USA did not exist at the time of Russian decimalisation in 1704), increased [[productivity]], the [[Erie Canal]], railroads, [[telegraphs]], [[department stores]], [[Quaker Oats]], X-ray diagnostics, [[biofeedback]], and [[servo control]] systems in a [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft.

===''Connections³'' (1997)===
# "Feedback" – Electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by [[Claude Bernard]], whose vivisection experiments kick off animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there that are using [[Matthew Maury]]'s data on wind and currents transmitted by the radio telegraph, invented by [[Samuel Morse]], who is also a painter whose hero is [[Washington Allston]], who spends time in Italy with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who comes to [[Malta]] and spies for the governor [[Alexander Ball]], who saved Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s skin so he can go head over heels for [[Emma Hamilton]] in Naples, resulting in an illegitimate son. Emma became notable in the [[James Graham (sexologist)#The Celestial Bed|Electrico-Magnetico Celestial Bed]], where you go regain your fertility through electricity, and you can get more whisky thanks to [[Joseph Black]], who determined the latent heat of vaporisation in steam. [[James Watt]] borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper. The paper is used for decorating walls by [[William Morris]],  who is a socialist with [[Annie Besant]], who is a vegetarian just like the [[Seventh-day Adventists]]. And we end up with [[W.K. Kellogg]]'s cornflakes.
# "What's in a Name?" – Remember the cornflakes from last episode? Because corncobs make adhesives to bond [[carborundum]] discovered by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs, silicon carbide is also then used as protection against armour-piercing shells developed to hit tanks that start life as American tractors, which use diesel engines developed from funding from [[Krupp]], who inspired Bismarck's welfare scheme based on [[Adolphe Quetelet|Quetelet's]] statistics that inspired the [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], whose [[punch cards]] were used to rivet the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], the monster ship that laid the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] insulated with [[gutta-percha]] used to manufacture golf balls for factory managers in industrial Scotland, where James Watt had a run-in with [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]], whose protegee was James Macie, also called [[James Smithson]], who caused all the row in the capitol building, so the money got used to set up a world-renowned institution named after James Macie's new family name, which was Smithson: The institution known as the [[Smithsonian]].
# "Drop the Apple" – At the Smithsonian, we learn of electric crystals that help Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discover what they call radium, and then Langevin uses the piezoelectric crystal to develop sonar that helps save Liberty ships (from German U-boats) put together with welding techniques using acetylene made with carbon arcs, also working the arc lights with clockwork regulators built by Foucault, whose pendulum helps him to take pictures of solar eclipses. Also thanks to ash from seaweed, [[interchangeable parts]] for clocks, the world of opera, and gurus, we get Einstein's theory of the gravity effect, which means Newton's universe is gone and you can drop the apple.
# "An Invisible Object" – Black holes in space, seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]], brought into space with hydrazine fuel, which was a byproduct of fungicides for French vines, fuelled by quarantine conventions and money orders, [[American Express]] and [[Buffalo Bill]], Vaudeville and French battles, [[Joan of Arc]] and the Inquisition, Jews welcomed by Turks, who lost to Maltese knights with surgeons trained on pictures by [[Titian]], in [[Augsburg]], where goldsmiths made French money to pay for tobacco. That triggered logarithms and slide rules made by clock makers, who also made pressure cookers that sterilised French beer kept cool by refrigerators that were also used to freeze meat and chill down paraffin wax for making objects invisible.
# "Life is No Picnic" – Instant coffee gets off the ground in World War II and Jeeps lead to nylons and stocking machines smashed by [[Luddites]], who were defended by [[Lord Byron]], who meets [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Turkey, avoiding the same blockade that inspires the "Star-Spangled Banner", which was really an English song all about a Greek poet discovered by a publisher whose son-in-law is pals with [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] of chronology fame, whose military boss, Maurice, inspires [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]], father of the runaway [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], whose teacher [[René Descartes]]' mechanical universe inspires the book about brains by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Willis]], which is illustrated by the architect of St. Paul's, [[Christopher Wren]], who dabbles in investments like [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s Louisiana scam that ruins France, and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and later the French finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], whose daughter is the opinionated [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|de Stael]], whose romantic pals get [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] looking into jellyfish so he can defend [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. This demonstrates that "Life is No Picnic".
# "Elementary Stuff" – [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who studied beetles, [[Oliver Lodge]] and telegraphy, a radio designed by [[Reginald Fessenden]], which was used by banana growers, studied by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]], who got the Swiss to use stamps on postcards with cartoons of Gothic houses of parliament, which in turn had been inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s Romantic movement, inspired by fake Scottish poems. The exiled Scots escaped to North Carolina, producing turpentine, which helped make Chinese lacquer on tinplate, which is for what [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] had hoped. French navy decorator [[Pierre Paul Puget]], who paints pictures of locations where barometers are the subject of investigation. The weather experimenter, whose brother's writing turns on Swift, whose pal Berkeley has visual theories that Young confirms while decoding ancient Egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by French balloonists. The American balloons are used for spying by [[Allan Pinkerton]] and his intrepid agent [[James McParland]], who becomes famous in England because of [[Conan Doyle]].
# "A Special Place" – Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffries]] of Leicester University in England develops DNA profiling and schlieren photography used by [[Theodore von Karman]] to study aerodynamics and [[Anthony Fokker]]'s airborne machine guns and the [[Red Baron]] and geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s romantic ideas that start in Italy and paintings of actors and lighthouses and the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] and Spanish gold and [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] and [[William Cheselden]]'s skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing aficionados who write books and [[Charles Cotton]] and sceptical wine-drinkers called [[Michel Eyquem]], and [[Edward Jenner]]'s cure for smallpox and [[J.J. Audubon]] and American bird painters and devious Russian real estate deals, and as a result in 1872, America gets a special place, the first national park, Yellowstone.
# "Fire from the Sky" –   Due to [[continental drift]] and [[Alfred Wegener]]'s passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of [[King Arthur]], whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval [[courtly love]] answers to adultery, which were in turn inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical [[Catharism|Cathars]], who lived next to the mystical [[Christian Kabbalah|cabalists]] who were fascinated with mystic numbers that spark [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Pico of Mirandola]]'s interest in Hebrew, which then brings trouble for [[Johann Reuchlin]], not helped by his nephew, the [[Protestant]] [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], who had a feud with [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]], who rewrites the work of [[Copernicus]]. Osiander's Italian pal, Dr. [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], who cures the asthmatic [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], executed for helping [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], whose lover, the explosive-bearing [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], ends up in Scandinavia with a friend of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], whose assistant, [[Willem Blaeu]], makes maps updated in the first true atlas by the Englishman Dudley, working in Italy for [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], who got opera started, which was a rave success, especially with the French [[Cardinal Mazarin]], whose library inspired [[Samuel Pepys|the secretary of the English navy]], which eventually buys French [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], after which [[Canning|Gamble]] gets the patent for canned food that feeds explorers like [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], who transplanted rubber trees to [[Sri Lanka]]. As a result of all that, we have rubber to mix with gasoline to make [[napalm]], which is "Fire from the Sky".
# "Hit the Water" – Thanks to napalm, made with [[palm oil]], also used for [[margarine]], stiffened with a process using [[kieselguhr]] that comes from [[plankton]] living in currents studied by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Ballot]] before observing the [[Doppler effect]] that caused [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] to measure the speed of light. Fizeau's father-in-law's friend, [[Prosper Mérimée]], who wrote "[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]"...&amp;nbsp;his friend, [[Anthony Panizzi]], who works at the British Museum, opened to house the collection of [[Hans Sloane]], who treats Lady Montague's smallpox before she sees Turkish tulips, first drawn by Gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with France, which was the first to develop military music and choreography, used in a London show by [[John Gay]], whose friend Arbuthnot does statistics that impress the Dutch mathematician who knows [[Voltaire]], who hears from the worm-slicing [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who stars in the story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Judge Hoffman]], who tries German nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the [[YMCA]] and the man who started the [[Red Cross]], who need a way to figure out blood types, surgical stitching and the perfusion pump invented by [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to [[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']], [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']], and the German invasion of Norway and the Allied commandos whose mission was to "Hit the Water".
# "In Touch" – Starting from an attempt for cheaper fusion power using superconductivity, which was discovered by Onnes, with liquid gas provided by [[Louis-Paul Cailletet]], who carried out experiments on a [[Eiffel Tower|tower]] built by [[Gustave Eiffel]], who also built the [[Statue of Liberty]] with its famous poem by the Jewish activist [[Emma Lazarus]], helped by [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Oliphant]], whose boss Elgin was the son of the man who stole the [[Elgin Marbles]] and sold them with the help of royal painter [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose colleague [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] had an assistant whose wife's lodger was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who charted the [[Gulf Stream]] with a thermometer [[Fahrenheit]] borrowed from [[Ole Rømer]], whose friend [[Jean Picard|Picard]] surveyed Versailles and provided the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspired [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel]] to write the book on gardening that was read by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], who hired the Scottish stonemason [[Thomas Telford]], whose idea for [[London Bridge]] was turned down by Thomas Young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do Hertz's electricity waves, with which Helmholtz prods a frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, Klages, analyses handwriting so individual post codes have to be capital letters to get your mail to a jungle village to keep you "In Touch".

==Related works==
All three ''Connections'' documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.

Burke also wrote a series of ''Connections'' articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and published a book of the same name (1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.

Burke produced another documentary series called ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original ''Connections''.

''{{YouTube|user=ArtOfTheProblem|title=Art of the Problem}}'' is a video series launched in 2011 on [[Kickstarter.com]] that was inspired by James Burke's ''Connections''. However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.

''[[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]]'', shown on [[BBC2]], follows a similar format.

===In video games===
''Connections'', a ''[[Myst]]''-style computer game with James Burke and others providing video footage and voice acting, was released in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/connections Connections – MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a runner-up for ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s award for the best "Classics/Puzzles" game of 1995, which ultimately went to ''[[You Don't Know Jack (1995 video game)|You Don't Know Jack]]''. The editors wrote of ''Connections'', "That you enjoy yourself so much you hardly realize that you're learning is a tribute to the design."&lt;ref name=cgw1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff |title=The Computer Gaming World 1996 Premier Awards |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=143 |date=June 1996 |pages=55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clip from the episode "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" appears in the 2016 video game [[The Witness (2016 video game)|The Witness]].

==Message structure==

Each '''Cosmic Call 1''' session had the following structure. The Scientific Part (DDM, BM, AM, and ESM) was sent three times (at 100 bit/s),&lt;ref name=RC1&gt;[http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/report-1999.html  "Broadcast for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence from Evpatoria Deep Space Center" Report on Cosmic Call 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Part (PP) was sent once (at 2000 bit/s),&lt;ref name=RC1/&gt; according to the following arrangement:

:DDM &amp;rarr; BM &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; ESM &amp;rarr; DDM &amp;rarr; BM &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; ESM &amp;rarr; DDM &amp;rarr; BM &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; ESM &amp;rarr; PP,

where DDM is the [http://www.plover.com/misc/Dumas-Dutil/messages.pdf Dutil-Dumas Message], created by Canadian scientists [[Yvan Dutil]] and [[Stéphane Dumas (astrophysicist)|Stéphane Dumas]], BM is the Braastad Message, AM is the [[Arecibo Message]], and ESM is the Encounter 2001 Staff Message.&lt;ref name=RC1/&gt;

Each '''Cosmic Call 2''' session in 2003 had the following structure:

:DDM2 &amp;rarr; DDM2 &amp;rarr; DDM2 &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; AM &amp;rarr; BIG &amp;rarr; BIG &amp;rarr; BIG &amp;rarr; BM &amp;rarr; ESM &amp;rarr; PP,

where DDM2 is modernized DDM (aka [[Interstellar Rosetta Stone]], ISR), BIG is [[Bilingual Image Glossary]].&lt;ref name=CC2/&gt;  All but the PP were transmitted at 400 bit/s&lt;ref name=CC2/&gt;

The ISR was 263,906 bits; BM, 88,687 bits, AM, 1,679 bits; BIG was 12 binary images 121,301 bits; ESM 24,899 bits.  Total = 500,472 bits for 53 minutes.  PP was 220 megabytes and sent at a rate of 100,000 bit/s for 11 hours total.&lt;ref name=CC2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3871">'''Cyberpolitics''' is a term widely employed across the world, largely by academics interested in analyzing its breadth and scope, of the use of the [[Internet]] for political activity. It embraces all forms of [[social software]]. Cyberpolitics includes:   [[journalism]], [[fundraising]], [[blog]]ging, volunteer recruitment, and organization building. 

The campaign of [[Howard Dean]], in which a previously little-known former Democratic governor of a small state emerged for a while as the front runner for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic presidential nomination]] on the strength of his campaign's skill in cyberpolitics, was a wake-up call to the American political establishments of political parties around the United States as to the importance of cyberpolitics as both a concept and as a series of organizational and communications strategies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Differential technological development''' is a strategy proposed by [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in which societies would seek to influence the sequence in which [[emerging technologies]] developed. On this approach, societies would strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.{{which|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Paul Christiano]] believes that while accelerating technological progress appears to be one of the best ways to improve human welfare in the next few decades, a faster rate of growth cannot be equally important for the far future because growth must eventually saturate due to physical limits. Hence, from the perspective of the far future, differential technological development appears more crucial.&lt;ref name=Christiano2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christiano|first1=Paul|title=On Progress and Prosperity|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/|website=Effective Altruism Forum|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|blog post on forum|date=July 2016}}

Inspired by Bostrom's proposal, [[Luke Muehlhauser]] and Anna Salamon suggested a more general project of "differential intellectual progress", in which society advances its wisdom, philosophical sophistication, and understanding of risks faster than its technological power.&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|author2=Anna Salamon|title=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import|date=2012|pages=18–19|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Facing the Intelligence Explosion|date=2013|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|url=http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2012/ai-the-problem-with-solutions/|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}} Brian Tomasik has expanded on this notion.&lt;ref name=Tomasik2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project|url=http://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/|website=Foundational Research Institute|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=23 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21417">An '''edublog''' is a [[blog]] created for educational purposes.

Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained for the purpose of classroom instruction, or blogs written about educational policy.  Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers.

==History==
Weblogs have existed for close to two decades. However, it wasn't until the second half of the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity.&lt;ref name=Blood&gt;{{cite book |last=Blood |first=Rebecca |chapter=Weblogs: A History and Perspective |title=We've Got Blog: How Weblogs Are Changing Our Culture |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5BEJ0nug7QC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=2009 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-7867-3086-5 |pages=7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now identified as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blood |first=Rebecca |title=weblogs: a history and perspective |url=http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html |publisher=Perseus Publishing |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries.&lt;ref name=Blood /&gt; An early recorded use of the term "edublog" can be traced to a [[webring]] called the [http://runhits.com//netring?ring=edublog&amp;action=member&amp;id=&amp;sort_order= Edublog WebRing], founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt; In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs.&lt;ref name=Treanor&gt;{{cite web |last=Treanor |first=Tom |title=2011 Blogging Statistics (infographic) |url=http://www.rightmixmarketing.com/right-mix-blog/blogging-statistics/ |publisher=Right Mix Marketing Inc. |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Edublog Awards]], the international and community based awards programme for the use of blogs and social media to support education, runs annually online across a range of platforms. The Awards were founded by [[James N. Farmer]] in 2004.

==Uses==

There are several uses of edublogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luján-Mora |first=Sergio |title=A Survey of Use of Weblogs in Education |journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Multimedia and Information and Communication Technologies in Education (m-ICTE 2006) |date=November 2006 |pages=255–259 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bloggers use their blogs as a learning journal or a knowledge log to gather relevant information and ideas, and communicate with other people.&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerawella |first=L. |last2=Minocha |first2=S. |last3=Kirkup |first3=G. |last4=Conole |first4=G. |title=An Empirically Grounded Framework to Guide Blogging in Higher Education |journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning |year=2008 |volume=25 |pages=31–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2729.2008.00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers use blogs to keep in contact with students' parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Luján-Mora |first=Sergio |title=Ways to use blogs in education |url=http://desarrolloweb.dlsi.ua.es/blogs/ways-to-use-blogs |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bloggers use blogs to record their own personal life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leslie |first=P |last2=Murphy |first2=E |title=Post Secondary Students' Purposes for Blogging |journal=International Review of Research IN Open Distance Learning |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and express emotions or feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dickey |first=M.D. |title=Impact of Weblogs (Blogs) on Student Perceptions of Isolation and Alienation in a Web-Based Distance Learning Environment |journal=Open Learning |year=2004 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=279–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some instructors use blogs as an instructional and assessment tool,&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=W |author2=Bonk, C |title=The Use of Weblogs in Learning and Assessment in Chinese Higher Education: Possibilities and Potential Problems |journal=International Journal on E Learning |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs can be used as a task management tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zing |first=X |last2=Harris |first2=S.T. |title=Blogging in an Online Health Information Technology Class |journal=Online Research Journal Perspective in Health Information Management |year=2005 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs are used to teach individuals about writing for an audience as they can be made public, and blogging software makes it easier to create content for the Web without knowing much HTML.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donnell |first=M |title=Blogging as Pedagogic Practice: Artefact  and Ecology |journal=Asia Pacific Media Educator |year=2006 |volume=1 |issue=17 |pages=5–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational blogs have also been used as an engagement and reflective assessment tool for Accounting students and can improve educational outcomes for Accounting students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joshi |first1=Mahesh |last2=Chugh |first2=Ritesh |date=2009 |title=New paradigms in the teaching and learning of accounting: Use of educational blogs for reflective thinking |work=International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pp=1–11 |url=http://ijedict.dec.uwi.edu/include/getdoc.php?id=4271&amp;article=664&amp;mode=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher blogs==

There are many teacher-related blogs on the internet where teachers can share information with one another. Teachers familiarize themselves with edublogs before implementing them with their students.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt; Many teachers share materials and ideas to meet the diverse needs of all learners in their classrooms.&lt;ref name=Poling /&gt; Teachers can often rely on these sources to communicate with one another regarding any issues in education that they may be having, including [[classroom management]] techniques and policies. In this way, the blog often acts as a support system for teachers where they can access ideas, tools, and gain support and recognition from other professionals in their field. Weblogs can provide a forum for reading, writing and collaborating.&lt;ref name=Poling&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poling |first=C |title=Blog On:Building Communication and Collaboration Among Staff and Students |journal=Learning and Leading with Technology |year=2005 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray, Hocutt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ray |first=B |last2=Hocutt |first2=M |title=Teacher- Created, Teacher-Centered Weblogs: Perceptions and Practices |journal=Journal of Computing in Teacher Education |year=2006 |volume=1 |issue=23 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edublogs can be used as instructional resources, in which teachers can post tips, explanations or samples to help students learn.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Hong |title=Exploring Educational Use of Blogs in U.S. Education |journal=China Education Review |year=2008 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=35 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED503871.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of blogs in the classroom allows both the teacher and student the ability to edit and add content at any time.&lt;ref name=Kajder&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kajder |first=S |author2=Bull, G |title=Learning and Leading Technology |journal=Scaffolding for Struggling Students |year=2003 |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for both the teacher and student to edit content allows for study to take place outside the classroom environment, since blogs can usually be accessed using the URL of the blog on any computer. Blogs increase exposure to other students from around the country or world, while improving writing and communication skills. Teachers are using blogs as a way to post important information such as homework, important dates, missed lessons, projects, [[discussion boards]], and other useful classroom information that is accessible by all.&lt;ref name=Churchill&gt;{{cite journal |last=Churchill |first=D |title=Educational Applications of Web 2.0: Using Blogs to Support Teaching and Learning |journal=British Journal of Education |year=2008 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=179–183 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, students can access this information from home, or from any computer that is connected to the Internet.

Teachers and parents can also use blogs in order to communicate with one another. They can be used to post class announcements for parents or providing schedule reminders.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; Connecting to a teacher's blog is also a convenient way for parents to find out daily assignments so that they can monitor their children's progress and understand classroom expectations.

==Student blogging in the K-12 classroom==
Student blogging describes students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 who are using blogs in some way in a formal classroom context. Blogs are digital platforms that provide students with a medium for sharing knowledge and experiences that go beyond the traditional means of reading and writing in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glewa |first=Monica |author2=Bogan, Margret B. |title=Improving Children's Literacy while promoting digital fluency through the use of blogs in the classroom. Surviving the Hurricane |journal=Journal of Literacy and Technology |year=2007 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=40–48 |url=http://literacyandtechnology.org/volume8/no1/JLTv8tech.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hsu |first=Chin-Lung |author2=Chuan Lin  Judy Chuan- |title=Acceptance of blog usage: The roles of technology acceptance, social influence and knowledge sharing motivation |journal= Information &amp; Management|year=2008 |volume=45 |pages=65–74 |url=http://ebiz.bm.nsysu.edu.tw/2009/m964012010/references/acceptance%20of%20blog%20usage,%20the%20roles%20of%20technology%20acceptance%20social%20influence%20and%20knowledge%20sharing%20motivation.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brady |first=Mark |title=Blogging:personal participation in public knowledge-building on the web |journal=Chimera Working Paper Number |year=2005 |volume=2 |pages=1–16 |url=http://recepzihni.org/..2010=fall=MANAGEMENT.INFORMATION.SYSTEMS/Knowledge.Society/15949059-CWP-2005-02-Blogging-in-the-Knowledge-Society-MB.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student blogging is a relative newcomer to the digital writing scene, and appears to have gained ground only in the past 7–8 years.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amasha, Mohamed"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Amasha |first=Mohamed |first2=Ab dulkarim A. |last2=AlSaif |title=A model of E-Learning Course for Teaching and Learning with Edublog and Social Network Services (SNS) |year=2009 |url=https://www.academia.edu/20080453/A_model_of_E-Learning_Course_for_Teaching_and_Learning_with_Edublog_and_Social_Network_Services_SNS_?auto=download}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chong&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chong |first=Eddy K.M. |title=Harnessing distributed musical expertise through edublogging |journal=Australasian Journal of Educational Technology |year=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=181–194 |url=http://www.editlib.org/p/44546/ |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past 5 years, however, student blogging has become a relatively common phenomenon in classrooms around the world.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blood |first=Rebecca |title=How Blogging Software Reshapes The Online Community |journal=Communications of the ACM |date=December 2004 |volume=47 |issue=12 |pages=53–55 |url=http://siti-server01.siti.disco.unimib.it/itislab/uploads/2007/11/how-blogging-software-reshapes-the-online-community.pdf |doi=10.1145/1035134.1035165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be attributable to the increase in free blog hosting services that have adjustable privacy settings, and the opening up of school internet filters to a greater range of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hu&gt;{{cite news |last=Hu |first=Winnie |title=A Call for Opening Up Web Access at Schools |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/education/29banned.html?_r=1 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of blogs in education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=www.examideas.com |url=http://www.examideas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives students a global perspective. Teachers and students from different states, countries, and continents are able to collaborate on different projects and ideas. A classroom in China can collaborate with classrooms in Germany, Mexico, Australia, etc. with just a few clicks of a button. Learning through blogs allows students to take control of their own learning and steer it to their own needs. Students are able to see that opinions and even strategies vary based on location and culture. Children are all different, but a common thread of learning can unite them. The use of blogs in the classroom engages children in learning and using [[technological literacy]] that will help them in adulthood.

There has not been a significant amount of research conducted on K-12 students regarding the efficacy of edublogs in enhancing learning. However, anecdotal results discussed by educators have given a glimpse into their utility or promise. There is a general consensus that edublogs create many opportunities for collaborative learning, as well as enhance the ability to locate and reflect upon work.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, W. (2006). Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common pedagogical uses===
According to extant literature, students use blogging in classrooms for different purposes. Blogs are used to showcase individual student work by enabling them to publish texts, video clips, audio clips, maps, photos and other images, projects and suchlike in a potentially publicly accessible forum.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffaker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huffaker |first=David |title=The Educated Blogger: Using Weblogs to promote Literacy in the Classroom |journal=AACE Journal |year=2005 |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=91–98 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of student blogging argue that blogging can contribute directly to improved writing abilities and argue that classroom blogging can enable students to engage with audiences beyond their classroom walls by using blogs as personal journals, as diaries, for story writing, and for making editorial responses to news events.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=James |author2=Bragg Anne  Bartlett |title=Blogs @ Anywhere: High Fidelity Online Communication |year=2005 |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane05/blogs/proceedings/22_Farmer.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716232120/http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane05/blogs/proceedings/22_Farmer.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Researchers have also documented teachers using student blogging to promote creativity and self-expression.&lt;ref name=Huffaker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read&gt;{{cite journal |last=Read |first=Sylvia |author2=Fisher Douglas |title=Tapping into Students' Motivation: Lessons from |journal=Voices from the Middle |date=December 2006 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=38–42 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=teal_facpub&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dtapping%2520into%2520students%2520motivation%2520lessons%2520from%2520young%2520adolescents%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26ved%3D0CEoQFjAB%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.usu.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1109%2526context%253Dteal_facpub%26ei%3DFeQGUOXOCYXl0QH76NzVCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNGLT7ikXvKYMNy5C5vumzvsEts7oA |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for use===
Some researchers claim that student blogs promote learning by providing opportunities for students to take more control of their learning and the content they engage.&lt;ref name=Huffaker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read /&gt;&lt;ref name=Curran&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curran |first=Kevin |author2=Marshall David |title=Blogs in Education |journal=Elixir Online Journal |year=2011 |volume=36 |pages=3515–3518 |url=http://eprints.ulster.ac.uk/20614/1/Elixir-Blogs.PDF |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also claimed that student blogging intrinsically [[motivate]]s students to become better readers and writers.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read /&gt;

===Potential limitations/some criticisms===
There is very little research on student blogging available.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt; That being said, there is a large amount of published [[anecdotal evidence]] regarding criticisms of student blogging or limitations in using blogging in classrooms. For example, commentators claim that student blogs often include uncorrected inaccuracies of information,&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; or can be used to instigate online bullying.&lt;ref name=Curran /&gt; Commentators also complain that student blogs are difficult to archive or index.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

== Professional development blogs for teachers ==

Although there are many blogs that teachers can use in the classroom with their students, there is also a multitude of blogs that teachers can use for their own professional development. Such blogs include hints on ways to be a better teacher in a certain subject area such as music, mathematics, or ESL, blogs on educational theory, blogs on advice for new teachers, blogs on where to find free technology, and blogs on transforming education, for example.  There is much that can be learned from blogs of other teaching professionals and the learning can be done anytime and anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, B. (2009).  Learning with blogs and wikis.  Retrieved on 03/02/13, from http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb09/vol66/num05/Learning-with-Blogs-and-Wikis.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[structural engineering]] and [[material science]], '''fast fracture''' is a term given to a phenomenon in which a [[wiktionary:flaw|flaw]] (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to [[catastrophic failure]] of the material. [[Stress (physics)|Stress]] acting on a material when fast fracture occurs is less than the material's [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]]. A very representative example of this is what happens when poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon's material.

'''First Tuesday''' is a networking forum for technology start-ups, their investors and related service providers.

==History==

First Tuesday was launched on the first Tuesday of October 1998 at the Alphabet Bar in [[London]] by its founders Adam Gold, [[Julie Meyer]], Mark Davies, John Browning and [[Nick Denton]]. The early First Tuesdays were held in the loft on Great Titchfield Street which housed Syzygy’s offices. Each month London’s Internet digerati would gather for drinks, and to listen to a speaker and share information on raising money and growing their Internet businesses.&lt;ref name=Riptide-NickDenton-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nisenholtz|first1=Martin|title=Interview Subjects: Nick Denton|url=http://www.digitalriptide.org/person/nick-denton/|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=Riptide|publisher=[[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]]|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early speakers included Rikki Tahta,  [[Brent Hoberman]] and [[Martha Lane Fox]], the founders of [[Lastminute.com]]; and [[John Taysom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meet-Markets For The New Economy First Tuesday's parties " by Nicholas Stein [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/07/10/283754/index.htm Fortune] July 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In late Spring 1999 Meyer left her job at NewMedia Investors to build First Tuesday's international network. In September 1999, First Tuesday launched into 17 cities across [[Europe]]. At Christmas 1999 and through the Millennium, Julie Meyer went to [[Israel]], meeting Shlomo Kalisch of Jerusalem Global who had launched Yazam, a similar concept to First Tuesday.

First Tuesday London was incorporated in early February 2000. Yazam tried to purchase First Tuesday in February 2000, but failed, ultimately succeeding on the 20th of July 2000. First Tuesday's City Leaders and Julie Meyer had led an alternative funding strategy with investments ready from Karl Christian Agerup of NorthZone Ventures and Rod Schwartz of [[Catalyst Technologies]]. This funding might have enabled First Tuesday to implement appropriate business models, corporate structures and management teams. The business model emerging through the structured First Tuesday Matchmaking events was to take 2% of funds raised at a First Tuesday Matchmaking event. Despite evidence that this was taking off, the company was sold.
 
First Tuesday was run as an independent business or not-for-profit organisation in most countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

'''Information grazing''' refers to the ability to quickly obtain knowledge and facts just in time to solve new problems or answer questions. "Information grazing" can also be "information jumping", jumping from site to site and cherry-picking information seems to "rewire" the brain to deleterious effects or focus on something long enough to fully understand all its implications.&lt;ref name=managing&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seaward|first1=Brian|title=Managing stress|date=2011|publisher=Paramount Wellness Institute|location=Boulder, Colorado|edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional learning, where learning a subject in depth was necessary to draw enough pertinent knowledge to solve new problems or answer questions, information grazing assumes some subjects are so large, fast-changing, interdependent, or esoteric, that traditional methods of learning may be unable to solve new problems or answer questions as efficiently. Information grazing is also one of the most commonly used [[coping techniques]] for stress and experts have noticed a trend with people  many under the age of 35.&lt;ref name=managing/&gt;

The change from a traditional in-depth learning and memorizing of facts to a mentality of quickly finding, using, and then forgetting knowledge, stems from the [[technological singularity]] concept that information is growing so fast (see [[information explosion]] or [[information overload]]) that an individual can no longer hope to be a "[[Polymath|renaissance man]]" or effectively keep up with some fields of knowledge. Examples of fields of knowledge that are more susceptible to information grazing techniques are science and engineering, where the “newest” knowledge has become so dynamic, that documentation and dissemination has increasingly moved from fixed paper media to digital formats allowing easier updating and searchability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  With the advent of the [[Internet]] and modern computer-cataloging of libraries, vast sums of knowledge are easily accessible in overwhelming quantities in real time. And, with expected future advances in [[search engine technology]] and library services, the trend of information overload is expected{{By whom|date=April 2011}} to worsen; information grazing techniques will become more prevalent to deal with the overload.

Disadvantages of information grazing come from its advantages. Switching from a "fixed" source of information that is constant, verifiable, and worth memorizing to "fluid" sources that are always in flux can lead to quick solutions that are unverified or worse, incorrect. Studies have shown that many people don't read past the first sentences of a Web site's content, and many never go beyond the first ten links listed in a search.&lt;ref name=managing/&gt; As information becomes more like an instantaneous consumable item, memorization is less fact-based but more procedural (i.e. how to find it). Similar concepts are found in Japanese education where after intense study of many unconnected facts, most of the information is forgotten or if remembered, not connected to other relevant facts. In the USA, this is similar to [[Cramming (memorization)|cramming]] an exam. Information grazing may have the same effect but greater, since it is done over the period of years.

According to Shenzhen-Guangdong Industry Research [[Contemporary Amperex Technology|CATL]] is the largest producer of Lithum-ion batteries for electric mobility with a capacity of 12 GWh. Followed by [[Panasonic]] and [[BYD Auto|BYD]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-05-08/newcomer-surges-to-top-of-electric-vehicle-battery-market-101245701.html|title=Newcomer Surges to Top of Electric-Vehicle Battery Market_Caixin Global_财新网|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shenzhen Gaogong Industry Research, CATL last year churned out 11.8 GWh in battery capacity, a surge of over 74% from 2016. Japan’s Panasonic was second-largest with 10 GWh, and BYD came in third with 7.2 GWh. Another China-based maker, OptimumNano Energy Co. Ltd., and South Korea’s LG Chem were No. 4 and No. 5, producing 5.5 GWh and 4.5 GWh respectively.

From February 1943 the US used a universal system to identify radar variants, consisting of three letters and a number, respectively designating platform, type of equipment, function, and version. This system was continued after WWII with multiservice designations being prefixed by 'AN/' for Army-Navy.

The number format is defined by the [https://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/Specs/S.R0048-A_v4.0_050630.pdf 3GPP2 report S.R0048] but in practical terms, it can be seen as an [[IMEI]] but with [[hexadecimal]] digits.

An MEID is 56 [[bit]]s long (14 hex digits). It consists of three fields, including an 8-bit regional code (RR), a 24-bit manufacturer code, and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number. The check digit (CD) is not considered part of the MEID.

The MEID was created to replace [[electronic serial number|ESN]]s, whose virgin form was exhausted in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/sites/default/files/pages/esn_meid_milestones_timeline.pdf "ESN Migration to MEID - Milestones &amp; Timeline"], The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As of TIA/EIA/IS-41 Revision D and TIA/EIA/IS-2000 Rev C, the ESN is still a required field in many messages—for compatibility, devices with an MEID can use a pseudo-ESN (pESN), which is a manufacturer code of 0x80 (formerly reserved) followed by the least significant 24 bits of the [[SHA-1]] hash of the MEID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdg.org/devices/meid.asp | title=Devices: MEID &amp; EUIMID | publisher=CDG | accessdate=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEIDs are used on CDMA mobile phones. GSM phones do not have ESN or MIN, only an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.

==Obtaining the MEID on your phone==
Open your phone's dialler and type *#06# to get its MEID number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bader | first = Daniel | title = How to make sure your phone works on a prepaid alternative carrier | url = https://www.imore.com/how-make-sure-your-phone-works-prepaid-alternative-carrier | work = [[iMore]] | date = 21 March 2017 | accessdate = 24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
The separation between international mobile equipment identifiers (IMEIs) used by GSM/UMTS and MEIDs is based on the number ranges. There are two administrators: the global decimal administrator (GDA) for IMEIs and the global hexadecimal administrator (GHA).

As of August 2006, the TIA acts as the GHA to assign MEID code prefixes (0xA0 and up), and the GSM Association acts as the global decimal administrator. http://www.babt.com/gsm-imei-number-allocation.asp

The TIA also allocates IMEI codes, specifically destined for dual-technology phones, out of the RR=99 range. Other administrators working under GSMA may also allocate any IMEI for use in dual-technology phones. Every IMEI can also be used as an MEID in CDMA2000 devices (as well as in single-mode devices designed with GSM or other 3GPP protocols) but MEID codes may also contain hexadecimal digits and this class of MEID codes cannot be used as an IMEI.

==Display formats==
There are two standard formats for MEIDs, and both can include an optional check-digit. This is defined by [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/X.S0008-0_v2.0_051018.pdf 3GPP2 standard X.S0008].

The hexadecimal form is specified to be 14 digits grouped together and applies whether all digits are in the decimal range or whether some are in the range 'A'-'F'. In the first case, all digits are in the range '0'-'9', the check-digit is calculated using the normal base 10 [[Luhn]] algorithm, but if at least one digit is in the range 'A'-'F' this check digit algorithm uses base 16 arithmetic. The check-digit is never transmitted or stored. It is intended to detect most (but not all) input errors, it is not intended to be a checksum or CRC to detect transmission errors. Consequently, it may be printed on phones or their packaging in case of manual entry of an MEID (e.g. because there is no bar  code or the bar code is unreadable).

The decimal form is specified to be 18 digits grouped in a 5 5 4 4 pattern and is calculated by converting the manufacturer code portion (32 bits) to decimal and padding on the left with '0' digits  to 10 digits and separately converting the serial number portion to decimal and padding on the left to 8 digits. A check-digit can be calculated from the 18 digit result using the standard base 10 [[Luhn]] algorithm and appended to the end. Note that to produce this form the MEID digits are treated as base 16 numbers even if all of them are in the range '0'-'9'.

==pESN conflicts==
Because the pESN is formed by a hash on the MEID there is the potential for hash collisions. These will cause an extremely rare condition known as a 'collision' on a pure ESN-only network as the ESN is used for the calculation of the Public Long Code Mask (PLCM) used for communication with the base-station. Two mobiles using the same pESN within the same base-station area (operating on the same frequency) can result in call setup and page failures.

The probability of a collision has been carefully examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/resources/esn/documents/Collisions_pESN_wp.pdf Pellegrino G, Quick F. White Paper on Pseudo-ESN Collisions. TIA. 26 May 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly, it is estimated that even on a heavily loaded network the frequency of this situation is closer to 1 out of 1 million calls than to 1 out of 100 000.

3GPP2 specification [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0072-0_v1.0_050727.pdf C.S0072] provides a solution to this problem by allowing the PLCM to be established by the base station. It is easy for the base station to ensure that all PLCM codes are unique when this is done. This specification also allows the PLCM to be based on the MEID or [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]].

A different problem occurs when ESN codes are stored in a database (such as for [[OTASP]]). In this situation, the risk of at least two phones having the same pseudo-ESN can be calculated using the [[birthday paradox]] and works out to about a 50 per cent probability in a database with 4,800 pseudo-ESN entries. 3GPP2 specifications [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0016-C_v1.0_041025.pdf C.S0016] (Revision C or higher) and [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0066-0_v1.0_040830.pdf C.S0066] have been modified to allow the replacement MEID identifier to be transmitted, resolving this problem.

Another problem is that messages delivered on the forward paging channel using the pESN as an address could be delivered to multiple mobiles seemingly randomly. This problem can be avoided by using [[mobile identification number]] (MIN) or IMSI based addressing instead.

==Code to convert==
This short [[Python (programming language)|Python]] script will convert an MEID to a pESN.
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import hashlib

meid = input("Enter a MEID: ").upper()

bytes = bytearray.fromhex(meid)
s = hashlib.sha1(bytes)
    #decode the hex MEID (convert it to binary!)

pesn = "80" + s.hexdigest()[-6:].upper()
    #put the last 6 digits of the hash after 80

print("pESN: " + pesn)
&lt;/source&gt;

The CDG also provides a [http://www.cdg.org/devices/meid/meid_euimid_calculator.asp javascript calculator with more conversion options].

A '''mobile form ''' is an electronic or digital form application that functions on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet device]]. Mobile forms enable users to collect [[data]] using [[mobile device]]s, and then to send the results back to the source. Mobile forms exist to replace paper forms as a more productive means of [[data collection]], eliminating the need to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] or scan paper data results into a back office system.

Depending on the [[mobile form]] [[App (computing)|application]] provider, some mobile form solutions allow offices to dispatch data to mobile form applications. In addition, other mobile form applications can be connected with various [[cloud service]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[social media platform]]s.

Depending on the business, the motivating factors to deploying mobile forms may vary. Some businesses implement mobile forms to speed up processes, while others institute mobile forms with field users to reduce [[cost]]s associated with transporting paper forms back and forth. Furthermore, [[Green business|green-minded businesses]] implement mobile forms in order to be more environmentally friendly, thus reducing their reliance on paper, ink printing, and subsequent waste.

Advanced mobile form features include [[signature]] capture, [[bar code]] capture, photo capture, [[GPS]] location form info, time form info, and skip logic.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Uses for mobile forms include:
* [[Safety inspection]]s 
* [[Work order]]s
* [[Expense report]]s
* [[Inventory]] reports
* [[Merchandise]] requisition
* [[Invoice|Invoicing]]

'''Momo'''  (Chinese: 陌陌; pinyin: mò mò) is a free [[social search]] and [[instant messaging]] [[mobile app]]. The app allows users to chat with nearby friends and strangers. Momo provides users with free instant messaging services through Wifi, 3G and 4G. The client software is available for [[Android (operating system)|Andr]][[Android (operating system)|oid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Momo for Android|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.immomo.momo#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLmltbW9tby5tb21vIl0.|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iOS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Momo for iOS in Chinese|url=https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/mo-mo/id448165862?l=en&amp;mt=8|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Momo for iOS in English"&gt;{{cite web|title=Momo for iOS in English|url=https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/momo-discover-meet-friend/id571534636?l=en&amp;mt=8|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/%E9%99%8C%E9%99%8C/052feb16-5bdd-4107-bcaa-09ed39590c91&lt;/ref&gt;

Momo officially began operations in July 2011, and one month later launched the first version of the app for [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1610601/000119312514403408/d732862df1.htm#rom732862_9&lt;/ref&gt; Momo filed for a NASDAQ IPO on November 7, 2014 and was listed in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/09/momo-a-flirting-app-with-180m-users-is-latest-chinese-tech-firm-to-file-for-a-u-s-ipo/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Founding and incorporation ===
Tang Yan, Zhang Sichuan, Lei Xiaoliang, Yong Li, and Li Zhiwei co-founded Beijing Momo Technology Co., Ltd. in July 2011.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
Prior to founding the company, Tang Yan worked as editor and then editor-in-chief at [[NetEase]]. In October 2014, Tang was named by [[Fortune Magazine]] as one of its "40 Under 40," a list of the most powerful business elites under the age of 40.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
The other co-founders all have prior experience with major Chinese Internet companies. 
In order to facilitate [[foreign direct investment|foreign investments]], Momo’s co-founders incorporated a holding company called Momo Technology Company Limited in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in November 2011. In July 2014, Momo Technology Company Limited was renamed to Momo Inc. and re-domiciled to the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
In December 2011, Momo established Momo Technology HK Company Limited (Momo HK) as a wholly owned subsidiary in [[Hong Kong]]. In March 2012, Momo HK established Beijing Momo Information Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing Momo IT), a wholly owned People’s Republic of China [[subsidiary]]. In May 2013, Beijing Momo established [[Chengdu]] Momo Technology Co., Ltd.(Chengdu Momo), as a wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

=== Growth ===
In December 2011, Momo announced reaching half a million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiang|first=Ben|title=Mobile Social App Momo Surpasses Half a Million Users, Coming to Android|url=http://technode.com/2011/12/22/mobile-social-app-momo-surpasses-half-a-million-users-coming-to-android/|publisher=TechNode|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the number of Momo users reached 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Millward|first=Steven|title=Momo App Reaches 2 Million Flirty Users, Says Some of its Couples Have Married|url=http://www.techinasia.com/momo-app-two-million-users/|publisher=Tech In Asia|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momo reached 10 million users on its first anniversary in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Millward|first=Steven|title=Momo App Hits 10 Million Users, A Whole Lot of Flirting Going On|url=http://www.techinasia.com/momo-app-10-million-users/|publisher=Tech In Asia|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Momo surpassed 15 million users. 
In 2014, App Annie reported that Momo was the number 2 non-game app of 2013 in terms of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://technode.com/2014/02/05/china-top-revenue-generating-mobile-apps-of-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2014, TechNode reported that Momo had announced reaching 100 million registered users. Momo executives also claimed they had reached 40 million monthly active users (MAU).&lt;ref&gt;http://technode.com/2014/02/07/momo-100-million-registered-accounts/&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Momo, in June 2014, total registered users and MAU reached 148 million and 52.4 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://technode.com/2014/10/13/momo-china-next-social-conglomerate/&lt;/ref&gt;
China Internet Watch reported more conservative estimates. In the months of August and September 2014, Momo had 51.279 and 52.101 million MAU. While Momo’s MAU grew, Wechat and QQ both lost MAU within the same time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinainternetwatch.com/ebook/top-100-mobile-apps-sep-2014/&lt;/ref&gt; Momo's prospectus reported 60.2 million MAU in September 2014.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

=== Financing ===
Momo reportedly raised USD 2.5 million in Series A financing. Angel investor, PurpleSky Capital (ZiHui ChuangTou), and [[Matrix Partners|Matrix Hong Kong]] led this round of financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Networking App Momo Said to Close 2nd-round Financing|url=http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2012/08/03/6484908.htm|publisher=Contact Center Solutions Industry News|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Momo's Form F-1 filed with the SEC reports that USD 5 million was raised in this round of financing.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; 
Momo Inc. completed its Series B financing in October 2012. This round of financing was led by two institution investors and received $100 million valuation. China Renaissance Partners acted as the exclusive financial advisor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinarenaissance.com/en/trans/style/adver/686.html&lt;/ref&gt; There was much speculation as to whether or not Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, was involved in this round of financing.&lt;ref name="techinasia.com"&gt;https://www.techinasia.com/momo-app-alibaba-funding/&lt;/ref&gt; Momo’s registration statement verifies this claim.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; In total, Momo raised approximately USD 40 million.&lt;ref name="techinasia.com"/&gt;
In October 2013, raised USD 45 million in Series C financing. Matrix Hong Kong, Gothic Partners, L.P., PJF Acorn I Trust, Gansett Partners, L.L.C., PH momo investment Ltd., Tenzing Holding 2011 Ltd., Alibaba Investment Limited, and DST Team Fund Limited were all issued and sold Series C preferred shares.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
In May 2014, Momo raised USD 211.8 million in Series D financing. Momo sold Series D preferred shares to Sequoia Capital China Investment Holdco II, Ltd., Sequoia Capital China GF Holdco III-A, Ltd., SC China Growth III Co-Investment 2014-A, L.P., Rich Moon Limited, and Tiger Global Eight Holdings.

== Product and services ==
Momo’s mobile application is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[Windows Phone|Windows]] platforms. It enables users to establish and expand their social relationships based on similar locations and interests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immomo.com/?v=zh&lt;/ref&gt; Some features of the application include subsections like: Nearby Users, Groups, Message Board, Topics, and Nearby Events. Users can send multi-media instant messages as well as play single and multi-player games within the app’s platform.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; Users also make a [[Facebook]]-like profile and are encouraged to include as much information as possible. Momo execs claim that this allows their software to create more accurate matches with nearby strangers. Momo prides itself on sifting through the clutter of mobile Internet users to find personalized matches for its users.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/10/27/one-in-a-billion-how-technology-is-transforming-dating-in-china/&lt;/ref&gt;
Momo offers users paid membership subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/06/28/chinese-flirting-app-momo-targets-monetization-with-introduction-of-premium-membership-and-stickers/&lt;/ref&gt; A membership will cost around USD 2 a month, or less if a user commits to a longer term of use. Benefits of a paid membership includes: VIP logos, advanced search options, discounts in the emoticon store, higher limits on maximum users in a group, and the ability to see a list of recent visitors to a user’s profile page.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; As of September 30, 2014, there was 2.3 million paid subscriptions.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
Like many other instant messaging services, Momo has integrated mobile games into their platform to monetize off their large user base. Third parties develop games, and revenues from in-game purchases are shared between Momo and the developers.

In August 2014, Momo launched Dao Dian Tong, a marketing tool for local merchants. Through Dao Dian Tong, local businesses and merchants can construct profile pages that allow Momo users to find them with the Momo’s LBS. Members can see the businesses just as they would see other Momo users.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;
Momo plans to further monetize user traffic by referring users from the Momo platform to e-commerce companies. Alibaba was specifically mentioned in Momo’s Form F-1.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

== Corporate affairs and cultures ==

=== Anti-plagiarism ===
In December 2012, Momo made an official announcement to accuse [[Sina Corp]] of copycatting straight from all the features of Momo Group. However, [[Sina Corp]] did not give its formal response.

=== Statement made by NetEase===
On December 10, 2014,  Momo's founder and CEO [[Tang Yan (executive)|Tang Yan]]'s former employer [[NetEase]] released a statement, accusing that Tang Yan has [[professional ethic]] issues, [[business ethics]] issues, and has been detained due to personal affairs by the local police in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=陌陌上市前夜CEO遭老东家痛批：没职业操守作风不端|url=http://finance.qq.com/a/20141210/007995.htm|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinions ==

=== Hook-ups and homeless dogs ===
On April 27, 2012, [[Mike Sui]], a [[mixed-race]] comedian and performer in China, first posted his "12 Beijingers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sui|first=Mike|title=12 Beijingers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HENoGStC6As|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[viral video]] which attracted nearly 5.17 million hits. In this video, one character mentions Momo, for the first time calling it ''a magical tool to get laid'' (Chinese: 约炮神器; pinyin: yuē pào shén qì ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Xu|title=First Impressions Count|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/chineseway/2012-05/17/content_433892.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Momo has spent millions of dollars to reverse the image of Momo as a one-night stand app.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; Momo, through its Weibo account, continues to engage the online community through various campaigns. Momo’s latest online campaign focused on supporting the homeless cats and dogs of China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weibo.com/momotech&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A new way to build a relationship ===
Although Momo is widely considered as adult social application, there are couples claiming that meetings on Momo resulted in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Met on Momo and resulted in marriage|url=http://weibo.com/1132702660/zg0zg2Hxq|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Met on Momo and resulted in marriage|url=http://weibo.com/1969557713/zf3mkyYuY|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momo now focuses on building all types of relationships, and no longer propagates itself as exclusively a monogamous relationship building applications.

'''Neo-Victorianism''' is an [[aesthetic]] movement which amalgamates [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] aesthetic sensibilities with modern principles and technologies. A large number of magazines and websites are devoted to Neo-Victorian ideas in [[dress]], [[family]] life, [[interior decoration]], [[morals]], and other topics.

A large number of neo-Victorian novels have reinterpreted, reproduced and rewritten Victorian culture. Significant texts include ''The French Lieutenant’s Woman'' ([[John Fowles]], 1969), ''Possession'' ([[A. S. Byatt]], 1990), ''Arthur and George'' ([[Julian Barnes]], 2005), ''Dorian, An Imitation'' ([[Will Self]], 2002) ''[[Jack Maggs]]'' ([[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], 1997), ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' ([[Jean Rhys]], 1966).
Recent neo-Victorian novels have often been adapted to the screen, from ''The French Lieutenant’s Woman'' (Karel Reisz, 1981) to the television adaptations of [[Sarah Waters]] (''[[Tipping the Velvet (TV series)|Tipping the Velvet]]'', BBC2, 2002, ''[[Fingersmith (TV serial)|Fingersmith]] '', BBC1, 2005, ''[[Affinity (film)|Affinity]] '' ITV, 2008) and [[Michel Faber]] (''[[The Crimson Petal and the White (miniseries)|The Crimson Petal and the White]]'', BBC 1, 2011). These narratives may indicate a 'sexsation' of neo-Victorianism [http://inter-disciplinary.net/ci/transformations/sexualities/s3/Kohlke%20paper.pdf (Kohlke)] and have been called 'in-yer-face' neo-Victorianism (Voigts-Virchow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigts-Virchow|first1=Eckart|title='In-yer-Victorian-face: A Subcultural Hermeneutics of  Neo-Victorianism|journal=LIT: Literature Interpretation Theory|date=2009|volume=20|issue=1–2|pages=108–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent productions of neo-Victorianism on screen include [[Guy Ritchie]]’s [[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]] films, the BBC’s ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' (2010-), ''[[Ripper Street]]'' (2012-16), ITV’s ''[[Whitechapel (TV series)|Whitechapel]] '' (2009–13) or the Showtime series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014-2016). The neo-Victorian formula can be expanded to include Edwardian consumer culture (''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ITV 2010-2015, ''[[The Paradise (TV series)|The Paradise]]'', BBC 2012-2013) and ''[[Mr Selfridge]]'' (ITV 2013-2016).

In September 2007, [[Exeter University]] explored the phenomenon in a major international conference titled ''Neo-Victorianism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Appropriation''.&lt;ref&gt;https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/31784&lt;/ref&gt; Academic studies include ''Neo-Victorianism: The Victorians in the Twenty-First Century, 1999–2009''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heilmann|first=Ann|title=Neo-Victorianism : the Victorians in the twenty-first century, 1999-2009|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-24113-8|author2=Llewellyn, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other foundational texts of neo-Victorian criticism are Kucich and Sadoff (2000), Kaplan (2007), Kohlke (2008-), Munford and Young (2009), Mitchell (2010), Davies (2012), Whelehan (2012), Kleinecke-Bates (2014), Böhm-Schnitker and Gruss (2014) and others.

==In arts and crafts==
Examples of crafts made in this style would include push-button [[cordless telephone]]s made to look like antique wall-mounted phones, [[CD player]]s resembling old time radios, Victorianesque furniture, and [[Victorian era]]-style clothing.

In [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] and fantasy art one can often see the elements of Victorian aesthetic values.  There is also a strongly emerging genre of [[steampunk]] art. [[McDermott &amp; McGough]] are a couple of contemporary artists whose work is all about a recreation of life in the nineteenth century: they only use the ultimate technology available, and since they are supposed to live anachronistically, this means the use of earlier photographic processes, and maintaining the illusion of a life stuck in the ways of a forgotten era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=David|title=&amp; :A History of Photography|year=1998|publisher=Arena Editions|location=Santa Fe|isbn=978-0965728027|edition=1st|author2=McGough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dress and behaviour==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Many who have adopted Neo-Victorian style have also adopted Victorian behavioural affectations, seeking to imitate standards of Victorian conduct, pronunciation, interpersonal interaction. Some even go so far as to embrace certain Victorian habits such as shaving with [[straight razors]], riding [[penny farthing]]s, exchanging [[visiting card|calling cards]], and using [[fountain pen]]s to write letters in [[Purple prose|florid prose]] sealed by wax. [[Gothic fashion]] sometimes incorporates Neo-Victorian style.

Neo-Victorianism is embraced in, but also quite distinguished from, the [[Lolita fashion|Lolita]], [[Aristocrat (fashion)|Aristocrat]] and [[Madam (fashion)|Madam]] fashions popular in Japan, and which are becoming more noticeable in Europe.

==Social conservatives==

Neo-Victorian [[aesthetic]]s are also popular in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] among [[cultural conservatives]] and  [[social conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladiesagainstfeminism.com/artman/publish/LAF_Theme_Articles_13/Is_This_a_Victorian_Site_41004.shtml |title=Is This a "Victorian" Site? |publisher=Ladiesagainstfeminism.com |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books such as ''The Benevolence of Manners: Recapturing the Lost Art of Gracious Victorian Living'' call for a return to [[Victorian morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichter|first=Linda S.|title=The Benevolence of Manners: Recapturing the Lost Art of Gracious Victorian Living|year=1999|publisher=ReganBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0060987459|edition=1st ReganBooks/Harper Perennial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Neo-Victorian is also commonly used in a derogatory way towards social conservatives.

The cultural social attitudes and conventions that many associate with the Victorian era are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rambles.net/sweet_victorians.html |author=Nicky Rossiter |title=Matthew Sweet: Inventing the Victorians |publisher=Rambles.net |date=2003-03-08 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many of the things that seem commonplace in modern life began in the Victorian era, such as sponsorship, sensational journalism and popular merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweet|first=Matthew|title=Inventing the Victorians|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0312283261|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and literature==
Neo-Victorianism can also be seen in the growing [[steampunk]] genre of [[speculative fiction]] and in music performers such as [[Emilie Autumn]]. Neo-Victorianism is also popular with, and in many ways prefigured by, those who are interested in [[Victoriana]] and [[historical reenactment]].

Neo-Victorian details appear in ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Neal|title=The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer|year=2003|publisher=Bamtam Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0553380965|edition=Bantam trade pbk. reissue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Neo-Victorians are one of the main groups of protagonists.

[[Carnival Diablo]] is a Neo-Victorian circus sideshow that has been touring North America for 20 years.

Unhallowed Metropolis is a roleplaying game based in a Neo-Victorian setting.

The '''Office of Science and Technology''' ('''OST'''), later (briefly) named the '''Office of Science and Innovation''', was a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government]] between 1992 and 2007.

The office was responsible for co-ordination of the Government's [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] related activities and policies, and the distribution of some £2.4 billion among the seven [[UK Research Councils]]. It was headed by the [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government|Chief Scientific Adviser]]; initially this was [[William Stewart (scientist)|Sir William Stewart]], then [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert (later Lord) May]], and finally [[David King (scientist)|Sir David King]]. 

The OST was originally formed in 1992 as a merger of the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser with the Science Branch of the [[Department of Education and Science]] (as it then was). Although originally run under the [[Cabinet Office]], it was moved between Departments in 1995 to operate under the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. In early 2006, the office was renamed to the "Office of Science and Innovation", and was subsequently absorbed into the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] in the Summer of 2007 when the Department for Education and Skills was split in two.

The Government Chief Scientific Advisor now heads the [[Government Office for Science]].

'''Online charging system''' ('''OCS''') is a system allowing a [[communications service provider]] to charge their customers, in real time, based on service usage.

==Architecture==
===Event based charging ===
Event based charging function (EBCF) is used to charge events based on their occurrence rather than their duration or volume used in the event. Typical events are SMS, MMS, purchase of a content (application, game, music, video on demand, etc.).

Event based charging function is used when the CC-Request-Type AVP = 4 i.e. for event request ex: diameter-sms or diameter-.....

===Session based charging ===

The session based charging function (SBCF) is responsible for online charging of network / user sessions, e.g. voice calls, IP CAN bearers, IP CAN session or IMS sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite | institution = 3rd Generation Partnership Project | series = Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; Charging management | title = Packet Switched (PS) domain charging (Release 15) | edition = 15.0.0 | url = http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/32_series/32.251/ | date = September 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Account and balance management ====
The account balance management function (ABMF) is the location of the subscriber’s account balance within the OCS.

The '''Pioneer plaques''' are a pair of [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[aluminium]] [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] which were placed on board the 1972 ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and 1973 ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' [[spacecraft]], featuring a [[pictogram|pictorial message]], in case either ''Pioneer 10'' or ''11'' is intercepted by [[extraterrestrial life]].

The ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' spacecraft were the first human-built [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|objects to achieve escape velocity]] from the [[Solar System]]. The plaques were attached to the spacecraft's [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] support [[strut]]s in a position that would shield them from erosion by [[space dust|interstellar dust]].

==History==
The original idea, that the Pioneer spacecraft should carry a message from mankind, was first mentioned by [[Eric Burgess]]&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he visited the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], during the [[Mariner 9]] mission. He approached [[Carl Sagan]], who had lectured about communication with intelligent extraterrestrials at a conference in [[Crimea]].

Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. [[NASA]] agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. Together with [[Frank Drake]] he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by [[Linda Salzman Sagan]], who was Sagan's wife at the time.

Both plaques were manufactured at Precision Engravers, [[San Carlos, California]].

The first plaque was launched with ''Pioneer 10'' on March 2, 1972, and the second followed with ''Pioneer 11'' on April 5, 1973.

In May 2017 a limited edition of 200 replicas engraved from the original master design at Precision Engravers was made available in a [[Kickstarter]] Campaign, which also offered laser-engraved replicas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Duane|title=Pioneer Plaque: a Message from Earth|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/duaneking/pioneer-plaque-a-message-from-earth|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

===Hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque hydrogen.svg|thumb|Hyperfine transition of neutral [[hydrogen]]]]
At the top left of the plate is a schematic representation of the [[hyperfine transition]] of [[hydrogen]], which is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the [[universe]]. The [[Hydrogen_line|spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom’s electron]] has a [[frequency]] of about 1420.405&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]], which corresponds to a [[Frequency#Period_versus_frequency|period]] of 0.704&amp;nbsp;[[Nanosecond|ns]]. Light at this frequency has a vacuum [[wavelength]] of 21.106&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre|cm]] (which is also the distance the light travels in that time period). Below the symbol, the small vertical line&amp;mdash;representing the [[binary numeral system|binary]] digit 1&amp;mdash;specifies a unit of length (21&amp;nbsp;cm) as well as a unit of time (0.7&amp;nbsp;ns). Both units are used as measurements in the other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Jake|title=The Pioneer Plaque: Science as a Universal Language|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/0120-the-pioneer-plaque-science-as-a-universal-language.html|website=The Planetary Society|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Figures of a man and a woman===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque humans.svg|thumb|Figures of a [[man]] and a [[woman]]]]
On the right side of the plaque, a man and a woman are shown in front of the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/10/aliens-modern-messages-earths-equality-diversity-seti-yuri-milner|title=Send aliens modern messages of Earth's equality and diversity, say scientists|date=10 September 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the brackets that indicate the height of the woman, the binary representation of the number 8 can be seen (1000, with a small defect in the first zero). In units of the wavelength of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen this means 8 × 21&amp;nbsp;cm = 168&amp;nbsp;cm.

The right hand of the man is raised as a sign of good will. Although this gesture may not be understood, it offers a way to show the [[opposable thumb]] and how the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] can be moved.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

Originally Sagan intended the humans to be shown holding hands, but soon realized that an extraterrestrial might perceive them as a single creature rather than two organisms.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The original drawings of the figures were based on drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and Greek sculptures.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The woman's [[sex organ|genitals]] are not depicted in detail; only the ''[[Mons pubis]]'' is shown. It has been claimed that Sagan, having little time to complete the plaque, suspected that NASA would have rejected a more intricate drawing and therefore made a compromise just to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], ''"The art of looking sideways"'', Phaidon Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7148-3449-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Sagan said that the decision to not include the vertical line on the woman's genitalia ([[pudendal cleft]]) which would be caused by the intersection of the [[labia majora]] was due to two reasons. First, Greek sculptures of women do not include that line. Second, Carl Sagan believed that a design with such an explicit depiction of a woman's genitalia would be considered too obscene to be approved by NASA.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;Sagan, C. (2009).&lt;!--The PDF version was created in 2009.--&gt; &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan, Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective, Cambridge University Press&lt;/u&gt; pp. 22-25 {{ISBN|0-521-78303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of [[Robert S. Kraemer]], however, the original design that was presented to NASA headquarters included a line which indicated the woman's [[vulva]],&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt; and this line was erased as a condition for approval of the design by John Naugle, former head of NASA's Office of Space Science and the agency's former chief scientist.&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;{{clear}}

===Relative position of the Sun to the center of the Galaxy and 14 pulsars===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque sun.svg|thumb|Relative position of the [[Sun]] to the center of the [[Galaxy]] and 14 [[pulsar]]s with their periods denoted]]
The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the [[Frequency|periods]] of [[pulsar]]s, using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of the launch can be calculated from these values.

The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the [[Sun]]. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the [[galactic plane]].

If the plaque is found, only some of the pulsars may be visible from the location of its discovery. Showing the location with as many as 14 pulsars provides redundancy so that the location of the origin can be [[triangulation|triangulated]] even if only some of the pulsars are recognized.

The data for one of the pulsars is misleading. When the plaque was designed, the frequency of pulsar "1240" (now known as J1243-6423) was known to only three significant decimal digits: 0.388 second.&lt;ref name=Sagan1972 /&gt; The map lists the period of this pulsar in binary to much greater precision: 100000110110010110001001111000. Rounding this off at about 10 significant bits (100000110100000000000000000000) would have provided a hint of this uncertainty. This pulsar is represented by the long line pointing down and to the right.

The fifteenth line on the plaque extends to the far right, behind the human figures. This line indicates the Sun's relative distance to the center of the galaxy.

The pulsar map and hydrogen atom diagram are shared in common with the [[Voyager Golden Record]].
{{clear}}

===Solar System===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque solar system.svg|thumb|The [[Solar System]] with the trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft]]
At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic [[diagram]] of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the [[trajectory]] shows its way past [[Jupiter]] and out of the Solar System. Both ''Pioneers 10'' and ''11'' have identical plaques; however, after launch, Pioneer 11 was redirected toward [[Saturn]] and from there it exited the Solar System. In this regard the ''Pioneer 11'' plaque is somewhat inaccurate.
The Saturn flyby of ''Pioneer 11'' would also greatly influence its future direction and destination as compared to ''Pioneer 10'', but this fact is not depicted in the plaques.

Saturn's rings could give a further hint to identifying the Solar System. [[Planetary ring|Rings]] around the planets Jupiter, [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] were unknown when the plaque was designed; however, unlike Saturn, the ring systems on these planets are not so easily visible and apparent as Saturn's. [[Pluto]] was considered to be a planet when the plaque was designed; in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] reclassified Pluto as a [[dwarf planet]] and then in 2008 as a [[plutoid]]. Other large bodies classed as dwarf planets, such as [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], are not depicted, as they were unknown at the time the plaque was made.

The binary numbers above and below the [[planet]]s show the relative distance to the Sun. The unit is 1/10 of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit. Rather than the familiar "1" and "0", "I" and "-" are used.

===Silhouette of the spacecraft===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque spacecraft.svg|thumb|Silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft relative to the size of the humans]]
Behind the figures of the human beings, the [[silhouette]] of the Pioneer spacecraft is shown in the same [[scale (spatial)|scale]] so that the size of the human beings can be deduced by measuring the spacecraft.

== Criticism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Voyager Golden Record]] --&gt;

One of the parts of the diagram that is among the easiest for humans to understand may be among the hardest for the extraterrestrial finders to understand: the [[Arrow_(symbol)|arrow]] showing the trajectory of Pioneer. An article in ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich]] ‘The Visual Image’, 1972 in Scientific American (eds {{clarify|date=August 2013}}) ''Communication''. San Francisco, California, Freeman, pp. 46–60; originally in a special issue of Scientific American, September 1972; republished in Gombrich (1982) ''The Image and the Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'', London, Phaidon, pp. 137–61.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the use of an arrow because arrows are an artifact of hunter-gatherer societies like those on Earth; finders with a different cultural heritage may find the arrow symbol meaningless.

Art critic and activist [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] said that sexual bias is exhibited by the choice to make the man in the diagram perform the [[Wave (gesture)|wave]] gesture to greet the extraterrestrials while the woman in the diagram has her hands at her sides.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 176. Bogue (1991) is being used as a secondary source for this criticism from Owens (1983).--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogue, R. (1991). &lt;u&gt;Mimesis in Contemporary Theory: (vol. 2) Mimesis, semiosis, and power&lt;/u&gt;. USA: John Benjamins Publishing Company. pp. 176. {{ISBN|1-55619-150-2}} (hb.) (v. 2 : US)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists also took issue with this choice for the same reason.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach"&gt;Achenbach, J. (1999). &lt;u&gt;Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe&lt;/u&gt; New York, NY: Citadel Press Books. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-8065-2496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Sagan regretted that the figures in the finished engraving failed to look panracial. Although this was the intent, the final figures appeared Caucasian.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach" /&gt; In the original drawing, the man was drawn with an "Afro" haircut, so an additional African physical trait would be included in the man to make the figures look more panracial, but that detail was changed to a "non-African Mediterranean-curly haircut" in the finished engraving.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 297.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gepper, A.C.T. (2012). &lt;u&gt;Imagining Outer Space: European Astroculture in the Twentieth Century&lt;/u&gt;. New York, NY: Smithsonian Institution. pp. 297. {{ISBN|978-0-230-23172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Carl Sagan said that Linda Sagan intended to portray both the man and woman as having brown hair, but the hair being only outlined rather than being both outlined and shaded made the hair appear blonde instead.&lt;!--This is at the top of page 74.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg, R. &amp; Moser, K. (2004). &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan: A Biography&lt;/u&gt; USA: Greenwood Press. pp. 74. {{ISBN|0-313-32265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people had different interpretations of the race of people depicted by the figures. Whites, blacks and Asians each tended to think that the figures resembled their own racial group, so, although some people were proud that their race appeared to have been selected to represent all of humankind, others viewed the figures as "terribly racist" for "the apparently blatant exclusion" of other races.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 82.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;

Linda Sagan decided to make the figures nude to address the problem of the type of clothes they should wear to represent all of humanity and to make the figures more anatomically educational for extraterrestrials,&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 79.--&gt; but their nudity was viewed as pornographic by the American media.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton"&gt;Wolverton, M. (2004). &lt;u&gt;The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes&lt;/u&gt; Joseph Henry Press. pp. 79, 80 &amp; 82. {{ISBN|0-309-53323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to astronomer Frank Drake, there were many negative reactions to the plaque because the human beings were displayed naked.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Carl Sagan]], ''Murmurs of Earth'', 1978, New York, {{ISBN|0-679-74444-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When images of the final design were published in American newspapers, one newspaper published the image with the man's genitalia removed and another newspaper published the image with both the man's genitalia and the woman's nipples removed.&lt;!--This is in the second and third paragraphs of page 23.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In one letter to a newspaper, a person angrily wrote that they felt that the nudity of the images made the images obscene.&lt;!--This is in the first paragraph of page 24.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt; In contrast, in another letter to the same newspaper, a person was critical of the [[Prude|prudishness]] of the people who found depictions of nudity to be obscene.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 24. The writer is being sarcastic in second and third paragraphs of page 24. Using sarcasm, the writer is mocking the prudishness which led to the censorship of the woman's vulva rather than supporting the censorship.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

==Fiction==
{{trivia|date=May 2017}}
{{ref-improve|section|date=May 2017}}
;Star Trek
*In the ''Star Trek Encyclopedia'' paperback – International Edition, October 1, 1999, the plaque is shown with Pioneer launching from the second planet rather than the third. 
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the plaque's diagram is fleetingly shown during Spock's mindmeld with V'ger, a transformed [[NASA]] space probe, ''Voyager 6''. This style of plaque was not used in the two actual NASA probes in the [[Voyager program]].
*In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the plaque appears on the viewing screen when a signal is sent by Rain Robinson trying to communicate with ''Voyager''. 16 minutes and 28 seconds into episode 8 season 3 Future's End.
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', the plaque is shown attached to a Pioneer probe floating in space—just before the probe is intercepted and destroyed by a bored [[Klingon]] ship captain, who scoffs "Shooting space garbage is no test of a warrior's mettle." However the plaque is erroneously depicted as facing outwards rather than inwards.
* In the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Federation'', a character mentions that humans had shown copies of the plaque to several alien races they encountered, but none had been able to decode it.

;Other
* In "[[The Message (The Outer Limits)|The Message]]," an episode of the science fiction series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', a deaf woman was featured receiving alien signals through her [[cochlear implant]], prompting her to write out Xs, 1s, and 0s on paper. When put together, the Xs turned into the images of the man and woman from the plaque, along with an extraterrestrial humanoid raising a hand in a peaceful gesture.
* On her album ''[[United States Live]]'', American performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]] contemplates extraterrestrials finding the plaque and asks "do you think that they will think his arm is permanently attached in this position?"
* In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Godfellas]]," the robot Bender finds himself doomed to drift through space, during which time he etches a modified version of the Pioneer plaque, with himself towering menacingly over the human figures, so that "When I'm found in a million years, people will know what the score was."
* In ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' season 1, episode 15 "Ardala Returns," Princess Ardala constructs a fake probe (allegedly launched in 1996) that utilizes a copy of the plaque in order to trick Buck into thinking the probe was from his own time period — the distant past.
* In the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', it is mentioned by the principal alien character that his race's conquest of Earth was made possible by their discovery of a space probe "that gave full directions to the place, had pictures of man on it and everything".
* In "[[Beware My Cheating Bart]]" (18th episode of Season 23) of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the plaque was briefly shown at the end of the episode. It was depicted with an extraterrestrial holding the plaque upside down, obviously confused by its strange depictions.
* The plaque is used as the artwork for the album ''Aufheben'' by [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]] and for ''Accept the Signal'' by [[Regular Fries]].
* A drawing which bears a strong likeness to the one depicted in the plaque was used as the artwork for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[avant-garde metal]] band [[Arcturus (band)|Arcturus]]' album ''[[Sideshow Symphonies]]''.
* A character in ''[[Kamen Rider Gaim]]'' uses a package containing language dictionaries and a modified version of the plaque to later communicate with an other-dimensional sentient race.
* In the TV show ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', on episode 5 of season 2 (Duck Duck Goose), the plaque is shown as part of the debris that lands on Earth.
* In the TV show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', on episode 21 of season 8 (The Communication Deterioration), the plaque is mentioned when they are discussing ideas about sending a message to alien races in space.
* In the video game by [[Paradox Development Studio]], ''[[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]]'', one of the scientific missions discovers the plaque on an alien world in the distant future.
* The Pioneer plaque appears in the booklet of [[David Bowie]]'s 2016 album ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'', on the page for the song "[[Girl Loves Me]]".
* The Pioneer plaque appears in 01 - Welcome / Orientation briefing video of the Mass Effect Andromeda Initiative website. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.masseffect.com/andromeda-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[17776]] has ''Pioneer 10'' (named Ten in the story) as a sentient being who is made fun of by ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (Nine) and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]]'' (JUICE) for being sent into space with a plaque displaying naked humans.
* In the [[Wii U]] title, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', the plaque is seen in the opening cut scene, damaged and floating in midspace, before one of the alien ships that later approaches Earth.
* [[Edwin_Morgan_(poet)|Edwin Morgan]]'s poem, "Translunar Space March 1972", refers to Pioneer 10, and passes critical commentary on the images on the plaque: "A deodorized American man / with apologetic genitals and no pubic hair / holds up a banana-like right hand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected Poems |authors=Edwin Morgan |year=1997 |publisher=Carcanet Press |location=Manchester |isbn=978-1-857541-88-5 |pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies''' was established in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about/mission/ nanotechproject.org] &amp;ndash; Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was intended to address the social, political, and public safety aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It intended in particular to look for research and policy gaps and opportunities in knowledge and regulatory processes, and to develop strategies for closing them. The project worked with multiple U.S. and foreign governments and organizations.

The project's stated goal was "to inform the debate and to create an active public and policy dialogue. It was not an advocate either for, or against, particular nanotechnologies. Rather, the Project sought to ensure that as these technologies are developed, potential human health and environmental risks were anticipated, properly understood, and effectively managed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about About The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5558">A '''quad chart''' is a form of [[technical documentation]] used to briefly describe an invention or other innovation through writing, illustration and/or photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx Quad Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330062910/http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx |date=March 30, 2013 }} at the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] official website. [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such documents are described as "quad" charts because they are divided into four quadrants laid out on a landscape perspective.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Technical Memorandum, Issues 4192-4200, pg. 3. [[Ames Research Center]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Paladino, ''Innovative Corporate Performance Management: Five Key Principles to Accelerate Results'', pg. 300.

[[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]: [[Academic Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|9780123694898}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically one-page only; their succinctness facilitates rapid decision-making.&lt;ref name=gao&gt;[[Government Accountability Office]] report to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], [http://www.gao.gov/cbi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-927 Managing for results enhancing agency use of performance information for management decision making]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, pg. 28. GAO-05-927, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Though shorter, quad charts often serve in a similar capacity to [[white paper]]s and the two documents are often requested alongside one another.

==History==
Quad charts as a genre were developed by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]'s [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in an attempt to improve budgeting and planning systems, and became widely used in the Administration's [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; The genre's development was parallel to that of [[display board]]s, also an early tool used by the NWS for staff communication.

In the early 2000s, software was developed to allow automated creation of quad charts as a means of saving time for [[technical writer]]s who would otherwise spend long periods of time drafting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Both government agencies and large businesses often require submission of a quad chart on the part of potential contractors as part of the contract bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130413184846/https://www.dtrasubmission.net/help/quadchart.asp Quad Chart], [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100814192100/http://www.science.mod.uk/Engagement/CDE/temp/quad_charts.aspx Engagement] at Centre for Defence Enterprise. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]], for example, uses quad charts to document the process of all [[Small Business Innovation Research]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States National Research Council]]'s ''An Assessment of the Small Business Innovation Research Program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration'', pg. 120. [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[National Academies Press]], 2009. {{ISBN|9780309124423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because decision makers often review a large volume of both solicited and unsolicited proposals, the quad chart may be the only submission from a potential contractor which the decision maker actually reads.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt;

Due to the nature of quad charts as relatively short documents, there are opportunities for misuse. While quad charts are intended for brief overviews of a topic, they can also be misconstrued to influence public policy and budgeting decisions, as was the case with the politicization of the [[National Military Strategy (United States)|National Defense Strategy]]'s 2005 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan P. Freier, "Present at the Counterrevolution: An Essay on the 2005 National Defense Strategy and Its Impact on Policy." Taken from the [[United States Army War College]] ''Guide to National Security Issues, Volume 2: National Security Policy and Strategy'', pgs. 120-121. Ed. J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr. 4th ed. July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
While there are no industry-wide standards for quad charts, there are a number of common elements. In addition to the title of the invention or idea and the name of the developer, the technical approach and the need which the invention or idea addresses are often included.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt; Decision makers often look to operational needs first, though including the cost and projected schedule are also often required elements.

[[Image:Hurt Report cover page.png|220px|thumb|Example of a front page of a report]]
A '''report''' or '''account''' is an [[Information technology|informational]] work, such as writing, speech, television or film, made with the intention of relaying information or recounting events in a presentable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/report|title=Report - definition of report by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report is made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a way that is concise, factual and relevant to the audience at hand. Reports may be conveyed through a written medium, speech, television, or film. In professional spheres, reports are a common and  vital communication tool. Additionally, reports may be official or unofficial, and can be listed publicly or only available privately depending on the specific scenario. The audience for a report can vary dramatically, from an elementary school classroom to a boardroom on [[Wall Street]].

== Usage ==
Reports fill a vast array of informational needs for a spectrum of audiences. They may be used to keep track of information, evaluate a strategy, or make decisions. Written reports are documents which present focused and salient content, generally to a specific audience. A type of an official report would be a police report, which could have legally binding consequences. Other types of reports, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', inform the public about the quality of products available on the market. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields, often to display the results of an experiment, investigation or inquiry.

== Attributes ==
One of the most common formats for presenting reports is [[IMRAD]]—introduction, methods, results, and discussion. This structure, standard for the genre, mirrors traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. Reports are not required to follow this pattern and may use alternative methods such as the problem-solution format, wherein the author first lists an issue and then details what must be done to fix the problem. Transparency and a focus on quality are keys to writing a useful report. Accuracy is also important. Faulty numbers in a financial report could lead to disastrous consequences.

== Standard Elements ==
Reports use features such as tables, graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade a specific audience to undertake an action or inform the reader of the subject at hand. Some common elements of written reports include headings to indicate topics and help the reader locate relevant information quickly, and visual elements such as charts, tables and figures, which are useful for breaking up large sections of text and making complex issues more accessible. Lengthy written reports will almost always contain a table of contents, appendices, footnotes, and references. A bibliography or list of references will appear at the end of any credible report and citations are often included within the text itself. Complex terms are explained within the body of the report or listed as footnotes in order to make the report easier to follow. A short summary of the report's contents, called an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], may appear in the beginning so that the audience knows what the report will cover. Online reports often contain hyperlinks to internal or external sources as well.

Verbal reports differ from written reports in the minutiae of their format, but they still educate or advocate for a course of action. Quality reports will be well researched and the speaker will list their sources if at all possible.

== Types ==
Some examples of reports are:

'''Single-source publishing''', also known as '''single-sourcing publishing''', is a [[content management]] method which allows the same source [[Content (media)|content]] to be used across different forms of [[Media (communication)|media]] and more than one time.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Ethier, ''XML and FrameMaker'', pg. 19.

The benefits of single-source publishing primarily relate to the editor rather than the [[User (computing)|user]]. The user benefits from the consistency that single-sourcing brings to terminology and information. This assumes the content manager has applied an organized [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]] to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful).&lt;ref name=petra/&gt; Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with '''multi-channel publishing''' though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.&lt;ref name=mek&gt;[http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards Single-Source &amp; Multi-Channel Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406072258/http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards |date=2010-04-06 }}. © 2013 Mekon, accessed 23 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
While there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different [[file format]]s or human [[language]]s (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.&lt;ref name=mek/&gt;

==History==
The origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bob162&gt;Bob Boiko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6nUDn3ZaBoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Content Management Bible], pg. 162. [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780764583643}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the eclipsing of [[MS-DOS]] by [[graphical user interface]]s, help files went from being unreadable text along the bottom of the screen to hypertext systems such as [[WinHelp]]. On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of [[software documentation]] did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of [[electronic publishing]], but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.&lt;ref name=bob162/&gt;

The first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at [[Schneider Electric]] in [[Seligenstadt]], using software based on [[Interleaf]] to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=inCeft4AkXcC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge Strategies for Going Multilingual in a Global Age], pg. 227. Eds. Robert C. Sprung and Simone Jaroniec. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9789027231871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[XML]], developed during the mid- to late-1990s, was also significant to the development of single-source publishing as a method. XML, a markup language, allows developers to separate their documentation into two layers: a shell-like layer based on presentation and a core-like layer based on the actual written content. This method allows developers to write the content only one time while switching it in and out of multiple different formats and delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Wallace and Anthony Levinson, "The XML e-Learning Revolution: Is Your Production Model Holding You Back?" Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=4RK7tJ-OO3cC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Best of The eLearning Guild's Learning Solutions: Articles from the eMagazine's First Five Years], pg. 63. Ed. Bill Brandon. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. {{ISBN|9780470277157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, several firms began creating and using single-source content for technical documentation (Boeing Helicopter, Sikorsky Aviation and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) and user manuals (Ford owners manuals) based on tagged SGML and XML content generated using the Arbortext Epic editor with add-on functions developed by a contractor.  The concept behind this usage was that complex, hierarchical content that did not lend itself to discrete componentization could be used across a variety of requirements by tagging the differences within a single document using the capabilities built into SGML and XML.
Ford, for example, was able to tag its single owner's manual files so that 12 model years could be generated via a resolution script running on the single completed file.  Pratt &amp; Whitney, likewise, was able to tag up to 20 subsets of its jet engine manuals in single-source files, calling out the desired version at publication time.  World Book Encyclopedia also used the concept to tag its articles for American and British versions of English.

Starting from the early 2000s, single-source publishing was used with an increasing frequency in the field of [[technical translation]]. It is still regarded as the most efficient method of publishing the same material in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Esselink, "Localisation and translation." Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=a4W7lWgCqYoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Computers and Translation: A Translator's Guide], pg. 73. Ed. H. L. Somers. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2003. {{ISBN|9789027216403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a printed manual was translated, for example, the online help for the software program which the manual accompanies could be automatically generated using the method.&lt;ref&gt;Burt Esselink, ''A Practical Guide to Localization'', pg. 228. Volume 4 of Language international world directory. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9781588110060}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metadata]] could be created for an entire manual and individual pages or files could then be translated from that metadata with only one step, removing the need to recreate information or even database structures.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Hofmann and Thorsten Mehnert, "Multilingual Information Management at Schneider Automation." Taken from ''Translating Into Success'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although single-source publishing is now decades old, its importance has increased urgently as of the 2010s. As consumption of information products rises and the number of target audiences expands, so does the work of developers and content creators. Within the industry of software and its documentation, there is a perception that the choice is to embrace single-source publishing or render one's operations obsolete.&lt;ref name=cms/&gt;

==Criticism==
Editors using single-source publishing have been criticized for below-standard work quality, leading some critics to describe single-source publishing as the "conveyor belt assembly" of content creation.&lt;ref&gt;Mick Hiatt, [http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ The Myth of Single-Source Authoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929043721/http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ |date=2013-09-29 }}. Mashstream, November 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While heavily used in technical translation, there are risks of error in regard to [[Index (publishing)|indexing]]. While two words might be [[synonym]]s in English, they may not be synonyms in another language. In a document produced via single-sourcing, the index will be translated automatically and the two words will be rendered as synonyms. This is because they are synonyms in the [[Source language (translation)|source language]], while in the [[Target language (translation)|target language]] they are not.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Mulvany, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G0Eqm8FbiTMC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Indexing Books], pg. 154. 2nd ed.

'''Technogaianism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "techno-" for [[technology]] and "gaian" for [[Gaia philosophy]]) is a [[bright green environmentalist]] stance of active support for the research, development and use of [[emerging technologies|emerging and future technologies]] to help restore [[Earth]]'s [[Natural environment|environment]]. Technogaians argue that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

This point of view is different from the default position of [[Radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]] and a common opinion that all technology necessarily degrades the environment, and that [[environmental restoration]] can therefore occur only with [[neo-luddism|reduced reliance on technology]]. Technogaians argue that technology gets cleaner and more efficient with time. They would also point to such things as [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s to demonstrate that developments do not have to come at the environment's expense. More directly, they argue that such things as [[nanotechnology]] and [[biotechnology]] can directly reverse [[environmental degradation]]. [[Molecular nanotechnology]], for example, could [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|convert garbage in landfills into useful materials and products]], while biotechnology could lead to novel [[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies|microbes that devour hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

While many environmentalists{{Who|date=January 2015}} still contend that ''most'' technology is detrimental to the environment, technogaians point out that it has been in humanity's best interests to exploit the environment mercilessly until fairly recently. This sort of behaviour follows accurately to current understandings of [[punctuated equilibrium|evolutionary systems]], in that when new factors (such as foreign [[species]] or [[mutant]] [[subspecies]]) are introduced into an [[ecosystem]], they tend to maximise their own [[resource consumption]] until either, ''a)'' they reach an equilibrium beyond which they cannot continue unmitigated growth, or ''b)'' they become extinct. In these models, it is ''completely impossible'' for such a factor to totally destroy its host environment, though they may precipitate [[ecological crisis|major ecological transformation]] before their ultimate eradication.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Technogaians believe humanity has currently reached just such a threshold, and that the only way for human civilization to continue advancing is to accept the tenets of technogaianism and limit future exploitive exhaustion of [[natural resource]]s and minimize further [[sustainable development|unsustainable development]] or face the widespread, ongoing [[Holocene extinction event|mass extinction of species]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Rosenzweig|Rosenzweig, Michael]]| title = Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise| publisher = Clarendon Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-19-515604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive effects of modern civilization can be mitigated by technological solutions, such as using nuclear power. Furthermore, technogaians argue that only science and technology can help humanity be aware of, and possibly develop counter-measures for, [[risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] such as a possible [[Asteroid impact avoidance|impact event]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; 

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] mentions Walter Truett Anderson, author of ''To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal'', as an example of a technogaian political philosopher;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1987"&gt;{{cite book| author = Anderson, Walter Truett| title = To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal| publisher = Harcourt| year = 1987| isbn = 0-15-190483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that technogaianism applied to [[environmental management]] is found in the [[reconciliation ecology]] writings such as [[Michael Rosenzweig]]'s ''Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise'';&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"/&gt; and considers [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Viridian design movement]] to be an exemplary technogaian initiative.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[Bruce Sterling|Sterling, Bruce]] | title = Viridian: The Manifesto of January 3, 2000|    year = 2001 | url = http://www.viridiandesign.org/manifesto.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories of English writer Fraser Clark may be broadly categorised as technogaian.{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} Clark advocated "balancing the hippie right brain with the techno left brain". The idea of combining technology and ecology were extrapolated at length by a South African eco-anarchist project in the 1990s. The [[Kagenna Magazine]] project aimed to combine technology, art and ecology in an emerging movement that could restore the balance between human and nature.

[[George Dvorsky]] suggests the sentiment of technogaianism is to heal the Earth, use [[sustainable technology]], and create ecologically diverse environments.&lt;ref name = dvorsky&gt;[http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2013/02/7-best-case-scenarios-for-future-of.html?spref=tw George Dvorsky, 7 Best-Case Scenarios for the Future of Humanity, Sentient Developments, (Feb. 2, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorsky argues that defensive counter measures could be designed to counter the harmful effects of asteroid impacts, [[earthquakes]], and  [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]].&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt; Dvorksky also suggest that genetic engineering could be used to reduce the environmental impact humans have on the earth.&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}

Climate engineering is a technogaian method that uses two categories of technologies- [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Carbon dioxide removal addresses a cause of climate change by removing one of the [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a technogaian method concerned with protecting society and the natural and man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-8493-1439-1

Another example of a technogaian practice is an artificial [[closed ecological system]] used to test if and how people could live and work in a closed [[biosphere]], while carrying out [[scientific experiment]]s. It is in some cases used to explore the possible use of closed biospheres in [[space colonization]], and also allows the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's.&lt;ref name="Gitelson, Livovsky &amp; MacElroy 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gitelson, I.

S. Matthew Liao, professor of philosophy and bioethics at [[New York University]], claims that the [[human impact on the environment]] could be reduced by [[Gene therapy|genetically engineering humans]] to have, a smaller stature, an intolerance to eating meat, and an increased ability to see in the dark, thereby using less lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-engineering-the-human-body-could-combat-climate-change/253981/ Ross Anderson, How Engineering the Human Body Could Combat Climate Change, The Atlantic, (March 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; Liao argues that human engineering is less risky than [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smatthewliao.com/2012/02/09/human-engineering-and-climate-change/ S.

[[Genetically modified food]]s have reduced the amount of [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]] needed for cultivation. The development of glyphosate-resistant ([[Roundup Ready]]) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity, such as [[atrazine]], [[metribuzin]] and [[alachlor]], and reduced the volume and danger of herbicide runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18268303 | doi=10.2134/jeq2006.0540 | volume=37 | issue=2 | year=2008 | pages=401–8 |vauthors=Shipitalo MJ, Malone RW, Owens LB | title = Impact of Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean and Glufosinate-Tolerant Corn Production on Herbicide Losses in Surface Runoff | journal = Journal of Environment Quality| url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=21799&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

* [[Diffusion (business)|Technological diffusion]]
* [[Technology acceptance model]]
*[[Technology life cycle]]
* [[Technology transfer]]

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7742">A '''tectonic weapon''' is a hypothetical device or system which could create [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es, or other seismic events in specified locations by interfering with the Earth's natural geological processes. It was defined in 1992 by Aleksey Vsevolovidich Nikolayev, corresponding member [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]: "A tectonic or seismic weapon would be the use of the accumulated tectonic energy of the Earth's deeper layers to induce a destructive earthquake".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA335648&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf 927N0104A Moscow ZNANIYE-Sila (in Russian) No. 1, Jan 92 p2-13, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology,  October 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; He added "to set oneself the objective of inducing an earthquake is extremely doubtful".

== Concept ==
Theoretically, the tectonic weapon functions by creating a powerful charge of [[elastic energy]] in the form of deformed volume of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] in a region of tectonic activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Disasters - Volume I|last=Kotlyakov|first=Valdimir|publisher=UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9781848267596|location=Singapore|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then becomes an earthquake once triggered by a nuclear explosion in the epicenter or a vast electric pulse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As to the question of whether a nuclear explosion can trigger an earthquake, there was the analysis of local seismic recordings within a couple of miles of nuclear tests in the 1960s at Nevada that showed nuclear explosions caused some tectonic stress.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-nuclear-explosions-cause-earthquakes?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products|title=Can nuclear explosions cause earthquakes?|website=www.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account provided by a member of the Nevada Commission on Nuclear Projects, also claimed that a 1968 underground nuclear test called Faultless successfully induced an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weather Warfare|last=Smith|first=Jerry|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2006|isbn=9781931882606|location=Kempton, IL|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] stated that it produced fresh fault rupture some 1200 meters long.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a theory that 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan was triggered by thermonuclear tests conducted in Indian and Pakistani test sites 2-20 days prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Remote Sensing Technology for Tsunami Modelling and Forecasting|last=Marghany|first=Maged|publisher=CRC Press|year=2018|isbn=9780815386391|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=4-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Reports==
Roger Clark, lecturer in [[geophysics]] at [[Leeds University]] said in the respected journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1996, responding to a newspaper report that there had been two secret Soviet programs, "Mercury" and "Volcano", aimed at developing a "tectonic weapon" that could set off earthquakes from great distance by manipulating electromagnetism, said "We don't think it is impossible, or wrong, but past experience suggests it is very unlikely". According to Nature these programs had been "unofficially known to Western geophysicists for several years". According to the story the Mercury program began in 1987, three tests were conducted in Kyrgyzstan, and Volcano's last test occurred in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=1zWNmzxDII&amp;dq=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;f=false R Clark, Nature, 10 October 1996, quoted in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Jan 1997, In Brief section]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such weapons, whether or not they exist or are feasible, are a source of concern in official circles. For example, US [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen|William S. Cohen]], said on 28 April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy, [[University of Georgia]], while discussing the dangers of false threats, "Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm  Federation of American Scientists]: Address by US Secretary of State at 1997 conference on terrorism&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's unsuccessful [[Project Seal]] programme during [[World War II]] attempted to create [[tsunami]] waves as a weapon. It was reported in 1999 that such a weapon might be viable.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_14884"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=14884 |title=Devastating tsunami bomb viable, say experts |author=Bingham, Eugene |date=28 September 1999 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed a small steam-powered [[Tesla's oscillator|mechanical oscillator]] he was experimenting with in 1898 produced earthquake-like effects, but this has never been replicated. The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' in [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Episode 60 .E2.80.93 .22Earthquake Machine.22|Episode 60 .E2.80.93]] made a small machine based on the same principle but powered by electricity rather than steam; it produced vibrations in a large structure detectable 100&amp;nbsp;feet away, but no significant shaking, and they judged the effect to be a busted myth.

==International treaties==
The 1978 [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]] is an international treaty ratified by 75 states, and signed by a further 17, that prohibits use of environmental modification techniques to cause earthquakes and [[tsunami]]s, amongst other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm US State Department: Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
After natural tectonic phenomena such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], [[conspiracy theories]], usually relating to the [[armed forces]] of the [[United States]] and formerly the [[Soviet Union]], often arise, though no [[evidence]] is advanced. After the Haiti earthquake it was widely reported that president [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] made unsupported allegations that it had been caused by testing of a US tectonic weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/hugo-chavez-haiti-earthquake-tetonic-weapon-100129.html LiveScience: Chavez: US 'Tectonic Weapon' Caused Haiti Quake, 29 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] of [[Moscow]] reported on page 1 on 30 May 1992 that "a geophysical or tectonic weapon was actually developed in the [[USSR]] despite the UN Convention", but  that Chief Seismologist Major-General V Bochrov of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|USSR Ministry of Defence]] categorically rejected any hints on the existence of tectonic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Komsomolskaya Pravda, 30 May 1992, p1, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, 10 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
=="Earthquake bombs"==

While the British [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] and [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]] bombs of [[World War II]] were called ''[[earthquake bomb]]s'', the name came from their way of destroying very hardened targets by shaking their foundations as an earthquake would; they were never intended to cause an actual earthquake.

The '''thermal power station Regina Margherita''' was a large power station for the production of electricity, preserved at the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The station opened in 1895 and was originally installed in the Egidio e Pio Gavazzi silk factory in [[Desio]] (Milan), where it operated until 1954. It supplied electricity for lighting and for the operation of 1,800 [[loom]]s, generating [[Alternating current|alternating electric current]] at a voltage of 200 V.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/catalogo_collezioni/scheda_oggetto.asp|title=Catalogo collezioni - Centrale termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Designed at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]], it was built by combining a [[steam engine]] from the [[Franco Tosi]] company of [[Legnano]] and a pair of [[alternator]]s from the [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Brown Boveri]] company.&lt;ref name="genMus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/centrale_reginamargherita/|title=Centrale Termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power station opened on November 9, 1895; the ceremony was attended by [[King Umberto I]] and [[Margherita of Savoy]], to whom the plant was dedicated.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

=== Museum ===
[[File:3421 - Milano - Museo Scienza e tecnica - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|Detail]]

In 1958 Egidio e Pio Gavazzi proposed to donate the power plant to the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]]. In order to exhibit the large machine, the floor was demolished, a stronger basement was built to support the item and the technical press consultation room was moved. Then the Desio plant was dismantled using  maintenance cranes and it was transported with a Riva lorry to the museum, where it was reassembled by hand and connected to an electric motor, coupled with a [[reduction gear]], and set in motion. The furnace and boiler, with their connected steam distribution pipes and pumps, were not transferred to the museum.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

== Description ==
The station contains two parts: thermal, consisting of a steam engine with two horizontal cylinders, and electric, consisting of two alternators and two exciter [[dynamo]]s. There is also an electric control panel and a lighting system with 8 lamps.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt; The machine is activated by an electric motor, connected to it by a chain which encircles a [[pulley]], and it no longer produces current.

== Technique ==
This machine is an example of a compound steam engine.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

Although it relied on the finest nineteenth-century technologies, the "Regina Margherita" was not a cutting-edge piece of machinery. Ten years before its making, the Englishman Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] had already invented the [[steam turbine]]. In the latter device the force of the steam acts directly on the blades of the wheel, producing the rotation necessary to operate the [[alternator]]s. The steam turbine is more efficient than a cylinder and [[piston]] system because it reduces energy waste from the transformation of alternating motion into rotary motion and from the transmission of movement through connecting rods, cranks and belts.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

==[[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial Period]] (1500s–1775)==
;1717 [[Swim fins]]
* Swim fins, also known as fins, or flippers, are blade-shaped extensions worn on feet or hands for use in water. They aid movement in aquatic sports such as swimming, surfing, and underwater diving. Swim fins are typically made of rubber or plastic. [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented wooden swim fins in 1717.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Historical Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|url=http://benfranklinexhibit.org/resume}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original design consisted of {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} palettes. Contrary to today's version of rubberized swim fins worn on the feet, Franklin's swim fins were originally intended for use on a person's hands. Shaped like lily pads or an artist's paint palette, they helped attain greater speed with each stroke.&lt;ref name="Inquiring Mind"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin: Inquiring Mind|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_inquiring_little.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin has since been posthumously honored by being inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some of Ben Franklin's Quirkiest Ideas|publisher=TechMediaNetwork.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/060117_ben_franklin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1730 [[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]
[[File:Hadley's octant.png|180px|left|thumb|Hadley's octant design]]
*An octant, also called "reflecting [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]", is a measuring instrument used primarily in navigation. It is a type of [[reflecting instrument]] that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant. The octant was invented in 1730 by [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]], a glazier in Philadelphia, and independently at the same time in England by the mathematician [[John Hadley]], who began work on a similar version of the octant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Muckelroy| first = Keith| title = Maritime Archaeology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvRKwa78s48C&amp;pg=PA124| year = 1978| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-29348-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the invention of the octant. Originally this instrument was referred to as "Hadley's quadrant", after the English inventor. These days it is now known as an octant, the name given to it by its American inventor, Thomas Godfrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octant|publisher=Institute of Navigation Museum|url=http://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=2&amp;scid=14&amp;iid=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1742 [[Franklin stove]]
*The Franklin Stove, also known as the circulating stove, is a metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow, providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace. The stove became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and gradually replaced open fireplaces. The Franklin stove was invented by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Franklin Stove by Benjamin Franklin in 1742|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/frankstove.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1744 [[Mail order]]
* A mail-order catalog is a publication containing a list of general merchandise from a company. Those who publish and operate mail-order catalogs are referred to as catalogers within the industry, who also buy or manufacture goods and then market those goods to prospective customers. Mail ordering uses the postal system for soliciting and delivering goods. According to The National Mail Order Association, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented and conceptualized mail order cataloging in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Order Catalog Vs. Online Shopping|publisher=Retail Interaction|url=http://www.retailinteraction.com/content/mail-order-catalogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1749 [[Lightning rod]]'''
* A lightning rod is one component in a lightning protection system. In addition to rods placed at regular intervals on the highest portions of a structure, a lightning protection system typically includes a rooftop network of conductors, multiple conductive paths from the roof to the ground, bonding connections to metallic objects within the structure and a grounding network. Individual lightning rods are sometimes called finials, air terminals or strike termination devices. In 1749&lt;ref name="Electrical Kite and Lightning Rod"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Benjamin Franklin's "Electrical Kite" and Lightning Rod|publisher=The New England Quarterly|jstor=359764 | volume=1|pages=180–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1750,&lt;ref name="Inquiring Mind"/&gt; the pointed lightning rod conductor, also called a "lightning attractor" or "Franklin rod", is generally thought to have been conceived when [[Benjamin Franklin]] came to the conclusion that electricity and lightning were identical and of the same.&lt;ref name="Electrical Kite and Lightning Rod"/&gt; By building lightning rods originally intended to be adorned atop church steeples, Franklin set about trying to prove their usefulness of shielding people and buildings from lightning. By 1752, Dr. Franklin tied the string of his "electrical kite" to an insulating silk ribbon for the knuckles of his hand. The kite in turn was attached to a metal key. During a storm, witnessed by his son [[William Franklin]], Dr. Franklin had finally proven that lightning was a form of electricity when the metal key received an electrical charge from a bolt of lightning. Thus, the practical use of lightning rods, attributed to the inventor Benjamin Franklin, was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Lightning Rod by Benjamin Franklin in 1752|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/lightningrod.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1752 [[Urinary catheterization|Flexible urinary catheter]]'''
* In medicine, a catheter is a tube that can be inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Catheters thereby allow drainage, injection of fluids, or access by surgical instruments. Prior to the mid 18th-century, catheters were made of wood or stiffened animal skins which were not conducive to navigating the anatomical curvature of the human urethra. Extending his inventiveness to his family's medical problems, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones. Dr. Franklin's flexible catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together in order for a wire enclosed inside to increase rigidity during insertion.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Historical Society"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Franklin's legacy to medicine|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4293380.stm | date=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franklin Trivia|publisher=Franklin &amp; Marshall College|url=http://www.benfranklin300.org/etc_trivia.htm#i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franklin| first = Benjamin| title = The complete works of Benjamin Franklin| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OF4-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264| year = 1888| publisher = G.

'''1761 [[Glass harmonica#Franklin's armonica|Armonica]]'''
* Also known as the glass harmonica or glass armonica, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented a musical instrument in 1761, an arrangement of glasses after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval in Cambridge, England. Dr. Franklin, who called his invention the "armonica" after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world première in early 1762, played by [[Marianne Davies]]. In this version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot-operated treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glass Armonica: Benjamin Franklin's Magical Musical Instrument|publisher=William Zeitler|url=http://www.glassarmonica.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[American Revolution|Independence]] and the [[Federalist Era]] (1776–1801)==
'''1776 [[Swivel chair]]'''
* A swivel or revolving chair is a chair with a single central leg that allows the seat to spin around. Swivel chairs can have wheels on the base allowing the user to glide the chair around their work area without getting up. This type of chair is common in modern offices and is often also referred to as an office chair. Using an English-style [[Windsor chair]] which was possibly made and purchased from [[Francis Trumble]] or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, [[Thomas Jefferson]] invented the swivel chair in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Fahlman| first = Bradley D.| title = Materials Chemistry| url = https://books.google.com/?id=zKcd0IJDWTsC| year = 2011| publisher = Springer| isbn = 9789400706934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson heavily modified the Windsor chair and incorporated top and bottom parts connected by a central iron spindle, enabling the top half known as the [[Chair|seat]], to swivel on casters of the type used in rope-hung windows. When the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened in Philadelphia, Jefferson's swivel chair is purported to be where he drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Jefferson later had the swivel chair sent to his Virginia plantation, [[Monticello]], where he later built a "writing paddle" onto its side in 1791. Since 1836, the chair has been in the possession of the [[American Philosophical Society]] located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windsor Writing Chairs|publisher=Gregory Le Fever|url=http://www.gregorylefever.com/pdfs/Writing%20Chair%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1782 [[Flatboat]]'''
* A flatboat is a rectangular [[boat]] with a flat bottom and square ends generally used for freight and passengers on inland waterways. After serving in the [[Pennsylvania Line]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Jacob Yoder]] invented and built a large boat at the [[Redstone Old Fort]] on the [[Monongahela River]], which he freighted with flour and carried to [[New Orleans]] in May 1782. This was the first attempt to navigate the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi rivers]] for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flatboat History|publisher=Jane's Saddlebag|url=http://www.janessaddlebag.org/about-us/big-bone-lick-area-history/flatboat-history.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119000210/http://www.janessaddlebag.org/about-us/big-bone-lick-area-history/flatboat-history.html|archivedate=2009-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt;

'''1784 [[Bifocals]]'''
[[File:US Navy 090617-N-1783P-009 Bob Gore uses bifocals that provide a magnification factor of 10x to read text.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Bifocals can provide a magnification factor of 10x to read text]]
*Bifocals are eyeglasses whose corrective lenses contain regions with two distinct optical powers. [[Benjamin Franklin]] is credited with the invention of the first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s, though according to the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], the first indication of Dr. Franklin wearing his double spectacles comes from a political cartoon printed in 1764. Many publications from that period onward refer to Dr. Franklin's double spectacles, including his first reference to them in a letter written in Paris, France on August 21, 1784, that was addressed to his personal friend, English philanthropist [[George Whatley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044912/http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|archivedate=2011-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin-Father of the Bifocal|publisher=Antique Spectacles|url=http://www.antiquespectacles.com/topics/franklin/franklin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1785 [[Diffraction grating|Artificial diffraction grating]]'''

*In optics, a diffraction grating is an optical component with a regular pattern, which diffracts light into several beams. The first man-made diffraction grating was invented around 1785 in Philadelphia by [[David Rittenhouse]] who strung 50 hairs between two finely threaded screws with an approximate spacing of about 100 lines per inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Parker AR |title=A geological history of reflecting optics |journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=1–17 |date=March 2005 |pmid=16849159 |pmc=1578258 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2004.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1787 [[Flour mill|Automatic flour mill]]'''

*Classical mill designs were generally powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket elevators, screw conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and bolting. This was the first time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alba Boardman Johnson Collection of Oliver Evans Manuscripts, 1786–1808|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/MIND_Repository_Details.aspx?rep_id=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1792 [[Cracker (food)|Cracker]]'''
* A cracker is a type of biscuit that developed from military hardtack and nautical ship biscuits. Crackers are now usually eaten with soup, or topped with cheese, caviar, or other delicacies. The holes in crackers are called "docking" holes as a means to stop air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Crackers trace their origin to the year 1792 when John Pearson of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] invented a cracker-like bread product from just flour and water that he called "[[pilot bread]]". An immediate success with sailors because of its shelf life, it also became distinctly known as a hardtack or sea biscuit for long voyages away from home while at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Saddleback| first = Under licence| title = Read, Reflect, Respond - Book 2| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WQu5Al02Y1IC&amp;pg=PA20| publisher = R.I.C. Publications| isbn = 978-1-74126-813-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}}

'''1793 [[Cotton gin]]'''
* The cotton gin is a machine that separates cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand. These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or, if badly damaged, disposed of. The cotton gin uses a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen, while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. In 1793, [[Eli Whitney]] invented the cotton gin and later received a patent on March 14, 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about Eli Whitney inventor of Cotton Gin in 1793|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/whitney.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney's cotton gin could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of "[[King Cotton]]" as the main cash crop in [[Southern United States|the South]]. However, it never made him rich. Instead of buying his machine, farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the increasing need for African-American slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eli Whitney The Invention of the Cotton Gin|publisher=Julian Rubin|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/whitneycottongin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1795 [[Jefferson disk|Wheel cypher]]'''
[[File:Jefferson's disk cipher.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Jefferson's disk]]
*The Jefferson disk, or wheel cypher, is a [[cipher system]] for encrypting messages and used as a deterrent for [[codebreaking]]. Using 26 wheels, each with the letters of the alphabet arranged randomly around them, [[Thomas Jefferson]] invented the wheel cypher in 1795. Falling in and out of use and obscurity, the wheel cypher was "re-invented" twice: first by a French government official around 1890, and then just prior to [[World War I]] by an officer in the [[United States Army]]. Designated as [[M-94]], the latter version was used by the United States Army and other military services from 1922 to the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson's Wheel Cipher|publisher=Ann M. Lucas, Monticello Research Department|url=http://www.monticello.org/reports/interests/wheel_cipher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1796 [[Rumford fireplace]]'''

*The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in 1796 when [[Benjamin Thompson Rumford]] introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. [[Thomas Jefferson]] had them built at Monticello, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] listed them among the [[modern conveniences]] that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Rumford Fireplace, Anyway?|publisher=Jim Buckley|url=http://www.rumford.com/articleWhat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1796 [[Cupcake]]'''
[[File:WikiXDC Cupcakes A.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Two cupcakes iced with the Wikipedia logo on their tops]]
*A cupcake, fairy cake, patty cake or cup cake is a small cake designed to serve one person, frequently baked in a small, thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations, such as sprinkles, are common on cupcakes. The earliest reference of cupcakes can be traced as far back as 1796, when a recipe notation of "a cake to be baked in small cups" was written in ''American Cookery'' by Amelia Simms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Timeline|publisher=Lynne Olver|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#cupcakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first use of the term "cupcake" was in ''Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats'' in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's ''Receipts'' cookbook where it referred to the use of a cup for measuring the ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cupcake History|publisher=Krystina Castella|url=http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1801 [[Suspension bridge]]'''

*A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck, the load-bearing portion, is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. Primitive in their earliest form, the ancestor to what is now considered a suspension bridge, the [[simple suspension bridge]], was developed sometime around 2000 BC in [[China]] and [[India]], relying upon ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river, from which people could hang as they crawled across. With the extreme dangers of swinging back and forth, these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across their wooden planks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Bridges|publisher=Bridgeman|url=http://www.nireland.com/bridgeman/Chronology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first suspension bridge in a modern sense, the ''Jacob's Creek Bridge'' at approximately 70 feet in length, was invented by [[James Finley (engineer)|James Finley]] of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] in 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Wire of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge|publisher=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron cables and to stiffen trusses in order to make the deck of bridges architecturally sound for passing travelers. Nowadays, suspension bridges use steel cables. However, the suspension bridge and its basic, fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing, is still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of the Modern World|publisher=The Science Museum|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/learning_modules/maths/02.TU.03/?section=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1801 [[Fire hydrant]]'''
* A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before the existence of fire hydrants, a primitive fire suppression system known as "fire plugs" consisted of burying a wooden water pipe (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then need to be hammered over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water.&lt;ref name="Fire Service History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Service History|publisher=Brookside Fire Company Inc.|url=http://www.brooksidefire.org/fire%20service%20history.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801.&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt; It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of "wet barrel" design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified due to the fact that the patent office in [[Washington D.C.]] was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bried History of the Hydrant|publisher=Fire Hydrant.org|url=http://www.firehydrant.org/pictures/hydrant_history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, [[Birdsill Holly]] invented the modern version of the fire hydrant. While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the fire hydrant, innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken for granted today. In 1869, Holly was issued U.S. patent #94749, for an "improved fire hydrant".&lt;ref name="Fire Service History"/&gt;

'''1802 [[Banjo clock]]'''
[[File:Banjo clock 001.JPG|180px|left|thumb|An example of a banjo clock]]
*A banjo clock is a wall clock with an inverted banjo-shaped case. The banjo clock normally lacks a [[Striking clock|striking mechanism]] and indicates time only by its hands and dial, for which reason some [[Horology|horologists]] may insist upon calling it a timepiece rather than a true clock. The clock is usually adorned with a [[finial]] on the top. Known as his "patent timepiece", the banjo clock was invented by renowned American clockmaker [[Simon Willard]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], and patented on February 8, 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Willard|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/643933/Simon-Willard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banjo clock|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51881/banjo-clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Jobe| first1 = Brock| last2 = O'Brien| first2 = Jack| last3 = Sullivan| first3 = Gary R.| title = Harbor &amp; home furniture of southeastern Massachusetts, 1710-1850| url = https://books.google.com/?id=f73DOPoRibIC&amp;pg=PA301| year = 2009| publisher = UPNE| isbn = 978-0-912724-68-3| page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1804 [[Burr Truss]]'''

*The Burr Arch Truss, Burr Truss, or the Burr Arch, is a combination of an arch and a multiple kingpost truss design typically implemented in the construction of covered bridges. The design principle behind the Burr arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge rigid. In 1804, American architect [[Theodore Burr]], a cousin of then Vice President of the United States, [[Aaron Burr]], designed and built the first Burr Truss on a bridge over the Hudson River in Watertown, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burr Truss|publisher=Naturally Fuzzy|url=http://www.naturallyfuzzy.com/Bridges/burr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1805 [[Amphibious vehicle]]'''

*An amphibious vehicle is one which can be used on land or water. The self-propelled variant was invented by [[Oliver Evans]] who named it the "Orukter Amphibolos". Its steam-powered engine drove either wooden wheels or a paddle wheel used as a means of transport, on land and in water. Evans demonstrated his machine in Philadelphia's Center Square in 1805, built on commission from the Philadelphia Board of Health. Evans' steam engine differed fundamentally from later models, operating at a high pressure, 25 or 30 pounds. Many years later, Evans' invention would be sold off for parts. On July 16, 2005, Philadelphia celebrated the 200th anniversary of Oliver Evans's Orukter Amphibolos. Many historians describe Oliver Evans' invention as the United States' first land and water transporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was This America's First Steamboat, Locomotive, and Car?|publisher=Invention &amp; Technology Magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16_print.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622133304/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16_print.shtml|archivedate=2009-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1805 [[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]'''
[[File:Gorrie Ice Machine.png|180px|left|thumb|Schematic of Gorrie's 1841 ice machine]]
*Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature. The American inventor [[Oliver Evans]], acclaimed as the "father of refrigeration", invented the [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] machine in 1805. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] and [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], where it would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again.

'''1833 [[Sewing machine|Sewing machine (lock-stitch)]]'''

*Most modern sewing machines use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, which consists of two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally through the hole in the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]] invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833.

'''1835 [[Solar compass]]'''
[[File:William Burt Solar Compass.jpg|180px|left|thumb|William Austin Burt's solar compass]]
*A solar compass is a railroad compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors to determine the north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle. It consists of three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed; one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by [[William Austin Burt]], a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the [[Michigan Territory]] earlier in 1833. While experiencing great difficulty in using his standard vernier compass in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the [[Northwest Territory]] (present-day [[Wisconsin]]), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines would be easier to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Compass|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032105/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=17|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burt's Solar Compass|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002627.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was issued to Burt on February 25, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1836 Solar Compass Patent|publisher=Virtual Museum of Surveying|url=http://www.surveyhistory.org/1836_solar_compass_patent1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1836 [[Morse code]]'''
[[File:J38TelegraphKey.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A typical "straight key" model used for transmitting and transcribing Morse code]]
*Morse code is a type of character encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as "dots" and "dashes" or "dits" and "dahs". In 1832, [[Alfred Vail]] in collaboration with [[Samuel Morse]], began the process of co-inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Morse Telegraphy|publisher=Amateur Radio Courses|url=http://www.ukradioamateur.co.uk/extra/morse/html/c19a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few minor changes, including the development of [[International Morse code]] which is distinct from the original encoding system, [[American Morse code]], Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morse: the end of an era?|publisher=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_08/uk/connex/txt1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist [[Joseph Henry]] and English scientist [[Michael Faraday]], the circuit breaker was invented by an American, [[Charles Grafton Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Handy| first1 = William Matthews| last2 = Higgins| first2 = Charles| title = The Making of America| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Z3JN-3bdkrkC&amp;pg=PA1| year = 1906| publisher = BiblioBazaar, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The plow is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Polishing Cast Steel Plow|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/deere.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839 [[Maize|Corn sheller]]'''

*A corn sheller or maize sheller, is a machine used to shell or shuck ears of sweet corn of their silk. By feeding ears of sweet corn into a concentric cylindrical rest, they are parallel to the axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed on one side of the machine. As the cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves, and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper, after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions. The corn sheller was invented by Lester E. Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12, 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Mr. L.E.

* The sleeping car or sleeper is a railroad passenger car that can accommodate passengers in beds, primarily to make nighttime travel more restful. The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s and could be configured for coach seating during the day. The pioneer of this new mode of traveling transcontinental was the [[Cumberland Valley Railroad]] which introduced service of the first sleeping car in the spring of 1939. The sleeping car did not become commercially practical until 1857 when [[George Pullman]] invented the Pullman sleeping car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Pullman|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventors/a/George_Pullman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839 [[Vulcanized rubber]]'''
* [[Sulfur vulcanization|Vulcanization]] refers to a specific curing process of rubber involving heat and the addition of sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When "rubber fever" struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Goodyear Receives patent for Vulcanized Rubber|publisher=Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities|url=http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WhiteMountainFreezer.jpg|left|180px|thumb|An early example of a hand-cranked ice cream maker]]
*An ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Ice Cream|publisher=MakeIceCream.com|url=http://www.makeicecream.com/hisoficecrea.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131533/http://www.makeicecream.com/hisoficecrea.html|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1843 [[Rotary printing press]]'''

*A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. In 1843, [[Richard Hoe]] invented a revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper. This eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type plates themselves, which were heavy and difficult to maneuver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame: Inventor Profile of Richard Hoe|publisher=Invent Now|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/274.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper. In 1845, Edward Maynard patented his new firearm invention which in later years, would be widely used in the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romano's First Model Maynard – a Sharpshooter's Carbine|publisher=Joe Bilby|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9906b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1845 [[Baseball]]'''
[[File:Baseball1866.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A sketch of an early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey]]
*As the United States' ''de facto'' [[national sport]] and pastime, baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each. Many historians attribute baseball's origins to the English sports of [[stoolball]] and [[rounders]] as well as to the 18th and 19th century North American sports of [[Old Cat]] and [[Town ball]], all early precursors to baseball. However, the bat-and-ball sports played in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere in the world prior to 1845 did not resemble the standard of modern-day rules as to which baseball has continuously used ever since the mid-19th century. In 1845, [[Alexander Cartwright]] wrote the official and codified set of regulated rules of baseball formally known as the [[Knickerbocker Rules]]. Cartwright's original 14 rules were somewhat similar to but not identical to rounders. Three exceptions devised by Cartwright included the stipulations that the playing field had to be laid out in a diamond shape rather than a square used in rounders, foul territories were to be introduced for the first time, and the practice of retiring a runner by hitting him with a thrown ball was forbidden. On June 19, 1846, the Knickerbocker Rules were instituted for the first time when Cartwright's [[New York Knickerbockers]] competed against the New York Nine, in what is considered by the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Cooperstown, New York as "the first modern base ball game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Cartwright: First Modern Game of Baseball 1845|publisher=Baseball Historian|url=http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=52|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000712030954/http://baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=52|archivedate=2000-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Doubleday myth|myth]] of [[Abner Doubleday]] inventing baseball debunked and 46 years after his death, Cartwright in 1938, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in the executive category.&lt;ref name="Ty Cobb"&gt;{{cite book| last = Rhodes| first = Don| title = Ty Cobb Safe at Home| url = https://books.google.com/?id=t7InOgXkqlAC| year = 2008| publisher = Globe Pequot| isbn = 978-0-7627-4480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Cartwright|publisher=Alexander Cartwright|url=http://www.cmgww.com/baseball/cartwright/about/awards.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ED6LKBp4?url=http://www.cmgww.com/baseball/cartwright/about/awards.html|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 1953, the [[83rd United States Congress]] unanimously credited Cartwright with inventing the modern sport of baseball.&lt;ref name="Ty Cobb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Year In Review : 1953 National League|publisher=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1953n.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The transverse shuttle is a method to drive a bobbin on a sewing machine so as to create the lockstitch technique. Transverse shuttles carry the bobbin in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft. As the earliest of bobbin drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by [[Elias Howe]] on September 10, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improvement in Sewing-Machines|publisher=Google Patents Search|url= http://www.google.com/patents?id=whVDAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1846 [[Printing telegraph]]'''
* The printing telegraph is a derivative of the electrical telegraph which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by electrical wire representing a letter of the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver would then receive the instantly readable text of the message on a paper strip. This is in contrast to the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted into readable text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in common use, namely along the United States east coast and in France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by [[Royal Earl House]] of Rockland, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Earl House Papers, 1885–1891|publisher=Smithsonian Museum of American History|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/MIND_Repository_Details.aspx?rep_id=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A doughnut or donut, is a type of fried dough food popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet (or occasionally savory) snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets. They are usually sweet, deep-fried from a flour dough, and shaped in rings or flattened spheres that sometimes contain fillings. The doughnut has a long history, supposedly a Dutch creation exported to [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day [[New York City]]) in the 1600s under the Dutch name of ''[[Oliebol|olykoeks]]''—"oily cakes". However, the ring-shaped doughnut with a "hole" in the center is thought to be an American creation, supposedly invented in 1847 by Captain Hanson Gregory of Clam Cove, Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Donut |publisher=Ted Goff |url=http://www.wentz.net/donut/history_of_the_donut.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211192133/http://www.wentz.net/donut/history_of_the_donut.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1848 [[Pin tumbler lock]]'''
* The pin tumbler lock is a lock mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may also be found in tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Yale Pin-tumbler invention|publisher=Yale|url=http://www.yalelock.com/en/yale/com/About-Yale/History-of-Yale/Brand-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Linus Yale, Sr.]] invented the modern pin-tumbler lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Locks|publisher=Haley's Lock, Safe and Key|url=http://www.haleyslock.com/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, [[Linus Yale, Jr.]] was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1849 [[Jackhammer]]'''
[[File:Tennessee Valley Authority Douglas Dam French Broad River Sevier County TN man with jackhammer 1942.gif|180px|left|thumb|Drilling a blast hole with a jackhammer]]
*A jackhammer, also known as a pneumatic hammer, is a portable percussive drill powered by compressed air. It is used to drill rock and break up concrete pavement, among other applications. It jabs with its bit, not rotating it. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a "percussion drill" was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Drinker| first = Henry Sturgis| title = Tunneling, explosive compounds, and rock drills| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CJ0gAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA153| year = 1878| publisher = J.

'''1849 [[Safety pin]]'''

*The safety pin is a fastening device, a variation of the regular pin, which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]], and patented in April 1849.

* Feed dogs are the critical component of a "drop feed" sewing machine. A set of feed dogs typically resembles two or three short, thin metal bars, crosscut with diagonal teeth, which move back and forth in slots in a sewing machine's needle plate. Their purpose is to pull ("feed") the fabric through the machine, in discrete steps, in-between stitches. [[Allen B.

*A vibrating shuttle is a bobbin driver design used in home lockstitch sewing machines during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It supplanted the earlier [[Bobbin drivers|transverse shuttle]] design invented by [[Elias Howe]] in 1846, but was itself supplanted by the [[rotary hook]] later on. American cabinetmaker [[Allen B. Wilson]] of Willet, New York invented the vibrating shuttle design in 1850. The owners of the 1848 Bradshaw patent claimed infringement by Wilson. However, it was without justication. In order to avoid a lawsuit, Wilson relinquished his interest in U.S. Patent #7,776 that was issued to him on November 12, 1850. A.P.

'''1851 [[Fire alarm box]]'''
* A fire alarm box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire department of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood in the days before people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by [[Moses G. Farmer]], an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Cause for Alarm|publisher=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/27/no_cause_for_alarm/ | first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1853 [[Potato chips]]'''
* Potato chips, also known as crisps in British English, are thin slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef [[George Crum]] at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Potato Chips by George Crum in 1853|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/potatochips.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin that they could not be eaten with a fork. As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices.

'''1857 [[Toilet paper|Toilet paper (mass-produced and rolled)]]'''
* Toilet paper is a soft paper product (tissue paper) used to maintain personal hygiene after human defecation or urination. However, it can also be used for other purposes such as absorbing spillages or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur [[Joseph Gayetty]], who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the [[Scott Paper Company]] co-invented rolled toilet paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Toilet Paper Belongs to America|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/07/07/mf.toilet.paper.history/index.html | date=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In home canning, food is packed into a jar, and the steel lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim of the jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by [[John Landis Mason]] and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mason Jar – History|publisher=Highland Brands, LLC.|url=http://www.canningpantry.com/mason-jar-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jelly beans are a small bean-shaped type of confectionery with a hard candy shell and a gummy interior which come in a wide variety of flavors. The confection is primarily made of sugar. The [[Turkish Delight]], a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly, covered in confectioner's powder, with roots dating to biblical days, was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior. However, it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the [[American Civil War]]. It wasn't until July 5, 1905, that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans sold by volume for nine cents per pound, according to the book, "The Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites".

*The motorcycle is a single-track, two-wheeled motor vehicle powered by an engine. Although the first gasoline/petrol motorcycle powered by an [[internal combustion engine]] was built in 1885 by a German named [[Gottlieb Daimler]], his may not have been the first motorcycle. Ironically, Daimler's motorcycle used a four-stroke internal combustion engine that wasn't of his own creation, instead having to rely upon an engine built by [[Nicolaus August Otto]] which he simply mounted onto the frame of a bicycle. Furthermore, if the definition of a motorcycle is inclusive of a [[steam engine]] and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine, then the world's first motorcycle may either have been American; a coal-powered, two-cylinder, steam-driven motorcycle known as the '''[[Roper steam velocipede]]''' invented by [[Sylvester Howard Roper]] in 1867;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motorcycle History: Invention of the Motorcycle|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/motorcycle.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Invented The Motorcycle|publisher=Clubcycle.com|url=http://www.clubcycle.com/who-invented-the-motorcycle.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps a French one, independently invented by a competing claim by French blacksmith [[Pierre Michaux]] and engineer [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]], who invented the '''[[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]]''' in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michaux-Perreaux steam motor bicycle, 1868.|publisher=Science &amp; Society Picture Library|url=http://www.ssplprints.com/image/83198/michaux-perreaux-steam-motor-bicycle-1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1867 [[Refrigerator car]]'''
* A refrigerator car or "reefer" is a refrigerated boxcar, designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars, neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. They can be ice-cooled, or use one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize carbon dioxide as a cooling agent. In the 1860s, slaughtered cattle from the [[Great Plains]] were preserved in barrels of salt. Regular box cars were loaded with ice in another effort to preserve fresh meat that had limited success. Generally, it was found more economical in the early days of refrigeration to cool the cars with ice or frozen brine which was periodically replenished at icing stations along rail routes. In 1857, the first shipment of refrigerated beef was made from the Chicago stockyards to the East Coast in an ordinary box car packed with ice. Finally in 1867, the first patent (U.S. Patent #71,423) for a specialized refrigerator car was issued to its inventor, J.B. Sutherland of Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Refrigerated Transportation|publisher=Perishable Logistics Network|url=http://www.perishablelogisticsalliance.com/eng/history.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*American football, known in the United States simply as football, is a spectator sport known for combining strategy with competitive physical play. The objective of the game is to score points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. The ball can be advanced by carrying it (a running play) or by throwing it to a teammate (a passing play). Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the goal posts at the opponent's end zone, or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his end zone. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires.

*Sandblasting or bead blasting is a generic term for the process of smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well. In 1870, the sandblasting process was invented and patented by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devil and the Surfaces|publisher=The Shot Peener|url=http://www.shotpeener.com/library/pdf/2006027.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the original idea for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in [[Jones County, Iowa]]. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking if they could be used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short [[broom stick]] and splitting the feathers with a [[pocket knife]], the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Corbit| first = Robert McClain| title = History of Jones County, Iowa past and present, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=b5gUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA477| year = 1910| publisher = S.

'''1875 [[Mimeograph]]'''
* The stencil duplicator or mimeograph machine is a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. [[Thomas Alva Edison]] invented the mimeograph in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison Patents Mimeograph|publisher=RANDY ALFRED|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/08/aug-8-1876-edison-patents-mimeograph/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1876 [[Synthesizer]]'''
* A synthesizer is an electronic instrument capable of producing sounds by generating electrical signals of different frequencies. These electrical signals are played through a loudspeaker or set of headphones. Synthesizers can usually produce a wide range of sounds, which may either imitate other instruments ("imitative synthesis") or generate new timbres. The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by [[Elisha Gray]] who accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self vibrating electromagnetic circuit and in doing so, invented a basic single note oscillator. This musical telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were created and transmitted, over a telephone line, by electromagnets. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator audible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Palatin Project-The life and work of Elisha Gray|publisher=Palatin Project|url=http://www.palatin-project.com/palatin-project/elisha-gray.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brown| first = Jeremy K.| title = Stevie Wonder Musician| url = https://books.google.com/?id=c1U2WpNdn8MC&amp;pg=PA50| year = 2010| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-1-4381-3422-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1876 [[Airbrush]]'''
* An airbrush is a small, air-operated tool that sprays various media including ink and dye, but most often paint by a process of nebulization. Spray guns developed from the airbrush and are still considered a type of airbrush.

'''1877 [[District heating]]'''

District heating distributes heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements. The heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. A system was built in France in the 14th Century and the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland began steam district heating service in 1853. However, the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in Lockport, New York, in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer [[Birdsill Holly]], considered the founder of modern district heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Foundations of District Heating|publisher=Morris A.

==[[Gilded Age]] (1878–1889)==
'''1878 [[Carbon microphone]]'''
* The carbon microphone is a sound-to-electrical signal transducer consisting of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon. When sound waves strike this plate, the pressure on the granules changes, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates. A direct current is passed from one plate to the other, and the changing resistance results in a changing current, which can be passed through a telephone system, or used in other ways in electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal. After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877, a United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878 ruled in favor of [[Thomas Alva Edison]] over a claim held by [[Emile Berliner]] since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison's Transmitter|publisher=Heritage Community Foundation|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/telephone/era/edisons_transmitter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1878 [[Pelton wheel|Free jet water turbine]]'''
* A free jet water turbine or impulse water turbine, also commonly known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each "spoke" in the wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed at the center of each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, [[Lester Pelton]] invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Jet Water Turbine|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pelton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1879 mechanical production of [[Photographic plate]]'''
* Photographic plates preceded [[photographic film]] as a means of [[photography]]. A light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied to a glass plate. This form of photographic material largely faded from the consumer market in the early years of the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were introduced. The wet [[collodion process]] was replaced by [[dry plate]]s at the start of the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/photography.html "Brief History of Astronomical Photography"] McCormick Museum, University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical production of dry photographic plates were invented by [[George Eastman]] who filed U.S. patent #226,503 on September 9, 1879, for (in his own words "An Improved Process for Preparing Gelatine Dry-Film Plates") which was issued to him on April 13, 1880.&lt;ref name="Inventions and Their Inventors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Eastman|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=DMllAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1879 [[Carton]]'''
* A carton is the name of certain types of containers typically made from [[paperboard]] or [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]. Many types of cartons are used in food packaging. Sometimes a carton is also called a [[box]]. The history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 when it was invented in a Brooklyn, New York factory. The inventor of the folded carton was [[Robert Gair]]. He cast a die-ruled, cut, and scored paperboard into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the [[Nabisco|National Biscuit Company]] was the first to use cartons to package [[Cracker (food)|crackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wybenga| first = George L.| title = The packaging designer's book of patterns| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YolxngEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA16| year = 2000| publisher = Bilimsel Eserler| isbn = 978-0-471-38504-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1879 [[Cash register]]'''
[[File:Cash register Japan2007.JPG|180px|left|thumb|An example of a cash register in Japan]]
The cash register is a device for calculating and recording sales transactions. When a transaction was completed, the first cash registers used a bell that rang and the amount was noted on a large dial on the front of the machine. During each sale, a paper tape was punched with holes so that the merchant could keep track of sales. Known as the "Incorruptible Cashier", the mechanical cash register was invented and patented in 1879 by [[James Ritty]] of Dayton, Ohio. John H. Patterson bought Ritty's patent and his cash register company in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cole| first1 = David John| last2 = Browning| first2 = Eve| last3 = Schroeder| first3 = Fred E.H.| title = Encyclopedia of modern everyday inventions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=rVQfBSlAZvAC&amp;pg=PA53| year = 2003| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-31345-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1880 [[Oil burner]]'''

An oil burner is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is directed under pressure through a nozzle to produce a fine spray, which is usually ignited by an [[electric spark]] with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, [[Amanda Jones (inventor)|Amanda Jones]] invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Feature: Forgotten Inventors|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/telephone/sfeature/index.html#invent6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1880 [[Candlepin bowling]]'''

Candlepin bowling is a North American variation of bowling that is played primarily in the Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. A candlepin bowling lane somewhat resembles lanes used in tenpin bowling. However, unlike tenpin bowling lanes that are flat, candlepin lanes are slightly depressed ahead of the pindeck. The candlepins themselves take on a cylindrical shape which are tapered at the tops and bottoms, thus giving them a resemblance to wax candles. In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented by Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|publisher=International Candlepin Bowling Association|url=http://www.bowlcandlepin.com/History.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1881 [[Electric chair]]'''
* Execution by electrocution is an execution method which the person being put to death is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. In 1881, [[Buffalo, New York]] dentist and inventor [[Alfred Southwick]] heard about an intoxicated man dying instantly after touch a live electric generator. Dr. Southwick concluded that electricity could be used as an alternative to hanging for executions. Southwick's dental work meant he was accustomed to performing procedures on subjects in chairs, and so he designed an "electric chair". It took nine years of development and legislation before the first person was executed via the electric chair, [[William Kemmler]] in New York's Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death, Money, and the History of the Electric Chair|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/Electric_Chair.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Metal detectors use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. In 1881, the Scots-American named [[Alexander Graham Bell]] invented the first metal detector as President James Garfield lay dying from a fatal gunshot wound. Despite an effort to locate the lodged bullet, Bell's invention proved to be unsuccessful as the metal detector was confused by the metal-framed bed which the assassinated president laid on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Metal Detector|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/Metal_Detector.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1883 [[Salt water taffy]]'''
* Salt water taffy is a variety of soft [[taffy (candy)|taffy]]. Despite the name, it does not contain sea water. The legend of how salt water taffy got its name is disputed. The most popular story, although unconfirmed, concerns a candy-store owner, David Bradley, whose shop was flooded during a major storm in 1883. His entire stock of taffy was soaked with salty Atlantic Ocean water. When a young girl came into his shop and asked if he had any taffy for sale, he is said to have offered some "salt water taffy". At the time it was a joke, because all his taffy had been soaked with salt water, but the girl was delighted, she bought the candy and proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother was in the back and heard the exchange. She loved the name and so Salt Water Taffy was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salt water taffy history |publisher=HungryMonster.com |url=http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&amp;fid=6706 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524081109/http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&amp;fid=6706 |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1883 [[Solar cell]]'''

A solar cell is any device that directly converts the energy in light into electrical energy through the process of photovoltaics. Although French physicist [[Antoine-César Becquerel]] discovered the [[photovoltaic effect]] much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by [[Charles Fritts]] in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named [[Russell Ohl]]. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of [[solar panel]]s through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of a Solar Cell – History of Solar Cells|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/sstartinventions/a/solar_cell.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "one-armed bandit" was invented in 1887 by [[Charles Fey]] of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols&amp;nbsp;– horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Fey- Slot Machine Inventor|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1887 [[Softball]]'''

As a bat-and-ball team sport, softball is a variant of [[baseball]]. The difference between the two sports is that softball uses larger balls and requires a smaller playing field. Beginning as an indoor game in Chicago, softball was invented in 1887 by [[George Hancock (softball)|George Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Birth of Softball|publisher=Steve Dimitry|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sd/slopitch/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1887 [[Comptometer]]'''
* A comptometer is a mechanical or electro-mechanical adding machine. The comptometer was the first adding device to be driven solely by the action of pressing keys, which are arranged in an array of vertical and horizontal columns. Although the comptometer was designed primarily for adding, it could also do division, multiplication, and subtraction. Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes, including calculating currencies, time and Imperial measures of weight. The original design was invented and patented in 1887 by [[Dorr Felt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felt &amp; Tarrant Comptometer |publisher=System Source|url=http://www.syssrc.com/html/museum/html/felt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Induction motor]]'''
[[File:Motors01CJC.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Examples of modern induction motors]]
An [[induction motor]] is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding instead of using mechanical commutation (brushes) that caused sparking in earlier electric motors. They are also self-starting. The Serbian-American inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] explored the idea of using a rotating magnetic induction field principle, using it in his invention of a poly-phase induction motor using [[alternating current]] which he received a patent for on May 1, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The electro-magnetic motor|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/tesla.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;October 12, 1887, Tesla filed U.S. patent #381,968 for an electro-magnetic motor which in the application, claimed to have invented the AC motor as well as a new power distribution system. {{cite web|title=Tesla's Electro-magnetic motor|publisher=IEEE|url= http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Tesla's_Electro-magnetic_motor}} The patent was granted on May 1, 1888 {{cite web|title=Electro-magnetic motor|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url= http://www.google.com/patents/US381968?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to Tesla's invention were licensed by [[George Westinghouse]] for the AC power system his company was developing.

The induction motor Tesla patented in the U.S. is considered to have been an independent invention since the Europe Italian physicist [[Galileo Ferraris]] published a paper on a rotating magnetic field based induction motor on 11 March 1888, almost two months before Tesla was granted his patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Ferraris Physicist, Pioneer of Alternating Current Systems (1847-1897) Inventor of the Induction Motor "Father of three-phase current" - Electrotechnical Congress, Frankfurt 1891|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/GalileoFerraris.html|publisher=Edison Tech Center|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Smil| first = Vaclav| title = Creating the Twentieth CenturyTechnical Innovations of 1867-1914 and Their Lasting Impact| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnA2YXVFhIYC&amp;pg=PA76| date = 14 July 2005| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-988341-7| page = 76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Drury| first = Bill| title = Control Techniques Drives and Controls Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vDQHzeEmSfUC| year = 2001| publisher = IET| isbn = 978-0-85296-793-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Boldea| first1 = Ion| last2 = Nasar| first2 = Syed A.| title = The Induction Machine Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thOPkFjrj5MC&amp;pg=PA2| year = 2001| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-4200-4265-8| page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A working model of the Ferraris inductionmotor may have been demonstrated at the University of Turin as early as 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Suss Langsdorf, Theory of alternating-current machinery - 1955, page 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Actes - Volume 1; Volume 10, 1964, page 427&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana'' - Volume 19, 1977, page 518&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Kinetoscope]]'''

The Kinetoscope was an early motion picture exhibition device. It was designed for films to be viewed individually through the window of a cabinet housing its components. The Kinetoscope introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by [[Thomas Alva Edison]] in 1888, his invention was largely developed by one of his assistants, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, between 1889 and 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison Motion Pictures|publisher=Library of Congress, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Trolley pole]]'''
[[File:Torolley Pole; Kanden Tunnel Torolley Bus, Japan.jpg|180px|left|thumb|An example of a trolley pole used in Japan]]
A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal placed in contact with an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car. The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent.&lt;ref name="Library and Archives Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents of Invention and the Story of Canadian Innovation|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innovations/023020-2720-e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, [[Frank J. Sprague]], who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888.&lt;ref name="Library and Archives Canada"/&gt; Known as the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]], this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Trolley System|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/sprague.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Drinking straw]]'''

The drinking straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually a drink from one location to another. The first crude forms of drinking straws were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. [[Marvin Stone]] is the inventor of the drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Straight Truth About the Flexible Drinking Straw|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=301|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013061838/http://invention.smithsonian.org/Resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=301|archivedate=2009-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Stepping switch]]'''
[[File:Uniselector Stepper detail.jpg|180px|left|thumb|An example of a Strowger-type selector assembly]]
In electrical controls, a stepping switch, also known as a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to one of a number of possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic [[telephone exchanges]] to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a [[Strowger switch]]). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by [[Almon Brown Strowger]] in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strowger - Invention of the Telephone Switch|publisher=Strowger|url=http://www.strowger.com/about-us/strowger-invention-of-telephone-switch.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822185417/http://www.strowger.com/about-us/strowger-invention-of-telephone-switch.html|archivedate=2010-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Revolving door]]'''

A revolving door has three or four doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, the revolving door was invented in 1888 by [[Theophilus Van Kannel]] of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HALL OF FAME: Revolving Door Structure|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/368.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827094633/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/368.html|archivedate=2009-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Ballpoint pen]]'''
[[File:BallpointMacro.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The tip of a ballpoint pen]]
A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber is filled with a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen is the creation of American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Mitchinson| first1 = John| last2 = Lloyd| first2 = John| title = The Book of General Ignorance| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1Mjd2GCRPmAC&amp;pg=PA124| year = 2007| publisher = Random House Digital, Inc.| isbn = 978-0-307-40551-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cole| first1 = David John| last2 = Browning| first2 = Eve| last3 = Schroeder| first3 = Fred E.H.| title = Encyclopedia of modern everyday inventions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=rVQfBSlAZvAC&amp;pg=PA33| year = 2003| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-31345-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of Everyday Things"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Acton| first1 = Johnny| last2 = Adams| first2 = Tania| last3 = Packer| first3 = Matt| title = Origin of Everyday Things| url = https://books.google.com/?id=FY35-noly_IC&amp;pg=PA22| year = 2006| publisher = Sterling Publishing Company| isbn = 978-1-4027-4302-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) "Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20" ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69–100, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor [[László Bíró]] offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.&lt;ref name="Origin of Everyday Things"/&gt;

'''1888 [[Telautograph]]'''

The telautograph, an analog precursor to the modern [[fax machine]], transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers at the sending station to stepping motors attached to a pen at the receiving station, thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made by sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper. The telautograph's invention is attributed to [[Elisha Gray]], who patented it in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telautograph|publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/telautograph.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Touch typing]]'''
* Touch typing is [[typing]] on a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] without using the sense of sight to find the [[Push-button|keys]]. Specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory. Touch typing typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for other keys. Touch typing was invented in 1888 by [[Frank Edward McGurrin]], a court stenographer from Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Simonis| first = Doris| title = Inventors and Inventions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=N4219UtKRYwC&amp;pg=PA1333| year = 2007| publisher = Marshall Cavendish| isbn = 978-0-7614-7761-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Salisbury steak]]'''
* Salisbury steak is a dish made from a blend of minced [[beef]] and other ingredients, which is shaped to resemble a [[steak]], and is usually served with [[gravy]] or [[Steak sauce|brown sauce]]. The Salisbury steak was invented in 1888 by American doctor and chemist [[James Salisbury]], who prescribed his "meat cure" for such ailments like rheumatism, gout, colitis, and anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jack| first = Albert| title = What Caesar Did for My Salad The Curious Stories Behind Our Favorite Foods| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uCzTNVCS45AC&amp;pg=PA47| year = 2011| publisher = Penguin| isbn = 978-1-101-55114-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1889 [[Flexible flyer]]'''
[[File:Boy on snow sled, 1945.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A boy atop a flexible flyer sled in 1945]]
A flexible flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden [[sled]] with thin metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident [[Samuel Leeds Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sledding at Westtown|publisher=Westtown School|url=http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720112950/http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sled|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=moJfAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1889 [[Payphone]]'''

A payphone or pay phone is a public telephone, usually located in a stand-alone upright container such as a phone booth, with payment done by inserting money (usually coins), a credit or debit card, or a telephone card before the call is made. Pay telephone stations preceded the invention of the pay phone and existed as early as 1878. These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a "postpay" machine that only accepted coins deposited after the call was placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Payphones|publisher=Worldpayphones.com|url=http://www.worldpayphones.com/northamerica/country-usa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declining numbers spell likely end to pay phones|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2003-07-30-pay-phones-passing_x.htm | date=July 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants are invited to structure their shared problems with the current system and develop shared visions and goals which are then tested for practicality through the use of experimentation, learning and reflexivity. The model is often discussed in reference to [[sustainable development]] and the possible use of the model as a method for change.

== History ==

There have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to motorised cars and the change from physical [[telegraphy]] to the electric [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzen|first=B|title=System innovation and the transition to sustainability: theory, evidence and policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within [[population dynamics]] and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=K|title=The world demographic transition cited by Rotmans et al 2001 "More Evolution than Revolution: Transition Management in Public Policy"|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1945|volume=237|issue=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within [[systems theory]] and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shove|first=E|author2=Walker, G |title=Caution! Transitions ahead: politics, practice and sustainable transition management|journal=Environment and Planning|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=763–770|doi=10.1068/a39310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management for Sustainable Development: A prescriptive, complexity-based governance framework|journal=Governance|year=2010|volume=23|issue=1|pages=161–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt; It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.&lt;ref name=rotmans2001 /&gt;

== Definition ==

Transition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux.&lt;ref name="kemp78"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R |author2=Loorbach, D |author3=Rotmans, J|title=Transition management as a model for managing processes of co-evolution towards sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology|year=2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=78–91|doi=10.1080/13504500709469709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics consider that the current [[political system]] is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="kemp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Loorbach, D |title=Governance for sustainability through transition management|journal=IHDP-conference|year=2003|url=http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/openmtg/docs/kemp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society&lt;ref name="loorbach2007"/&gt; (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging [[Grassroots|bottom-up]] approaches that are supported in a [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.

Unlike traditional forms of regulation that use [[command and control]] techniques, transition management does not seek to '''control''' the uncertainties of change but '''steer''', indirectly '''influence''' and '''redirect''' the choices of actors towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management: New mode of governance for Sustainable Development|year=2007|publisher=International Books|location=Utrecht, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of [[creative destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpter|first=J|title=The Theory of Economic Development|year=1934|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.

=== Levels within sociotechnical systems ===
Most literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.&lt;ref name="kemp2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foxon|first=J |author2=Geoffrey P. Hammond |author3=Peter J. Pearson |author4=Jacquelin Burgess |author5=Tom Hargreaves|title=Transition pathways for a UK low carbon energy system: exploring different governance patterns|journal=Paper for 1st European Conference on Sustainability Transitions: "Dynamics and Governance of Transitions to Sustainability", Amsterdam|year=2009|url=http://www.lowcarbonpathways.org.uk/lowcarbon/publications/Sust_Transitions_Conf_paper_Foxon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Landscape''' (Macro) refers to the overall socio-technical setting that encompasses both the intangible aspects of social values, political beliefs and world views and the tangible facets of the built environment including institutions and the functions of the marketplace such as prices, costs, trade patterns and incomes.

These processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.

* '''Regime''' (Meso) refers to the dominant practices, rules and technologies that provide stability and reinforcement to the prevailing socio-technical systems.

Technological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp106/sewp106.pdf Berkhout, F., Smith A. and Stirling, A. (2003). Socio-technological regimes and transition contexts.] SPRU Electronic Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt; The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Niche''' (Micro) is the level or 'area' at which the space is provided for radical innovation and experimentation. This level is less subject to market and regulation influences and can facilitate the interactions between actors that support product innovation.

Radical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;

Multi-level Perspective
Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.

Figure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png
Geels and [[Johan Schot|Schot]]: 2007&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and [[Johan Schot|Schot, J.W.]], 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass.  The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt;

=== Actors ===

Each level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:

* '''[[Government]]''' which creates top-down pressure from regulation, and the use of market incentives, while also encouraging the 'collective learning process' by supporting innovation financially and providing access to information provided by advisory boards&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotmans|first=J |author2=René Kemp |author3=Marjolein van Asselt|title=More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy|journal=Foresight|year=2001|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=874125&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;
* '''Market-based actors,''' who interact both vertically through the [[supply chain]] and horizontally with other industry leaders to share [[best practice]] and create innovative ideas.
* '''[[Civil society]]''' which is both the user of the end product provided by the market but also [[non-governmental organisations]] which can also provide pressure for change and space for innovation

=== Power and relationships ===

Power within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual [[adaptation]] towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Parto, S |title=Governance for sustainable development: moving from theory to practice|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development|year=2005|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://kemp.unu-merit.nl/pdf/IJSD%208(1)%2002%20Kemp%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== A multi-level framework ==

Kemp ''et al.''&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.

'''Strategic activities''' encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations)&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.

'''Tactical activities''' relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.

Finally the '''operational activities''' constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0–5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform "societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).

A further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change.  One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).

== Practice ==

There are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon ''et al.'' 2009) constitutes the following methodology:

A problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape '''pressures'''. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the '''shared visions''' and goals of the actors.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; The visions outlined are '''long term''' in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and [[blueprints]]. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a [[carbon-neutral]] future include; the [[hydrogen economy]], the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"/&gt;
Although each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.

Once the pathways have been created '''short-term 'interim' objectives''' can be formed through [[Backcasting]] (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt; Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. '''Experiments''' within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options [[snowball]] down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==

Although being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong [[lock-in (decision-making)|lock-in]], socially, politically and technically.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as [[offshore wind power|offshore wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[tidal power]].

At the regime level, institutions such as the [[European Investment Bank]] are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the [[Renewables Obligation]] channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More [[Renewable Obligation Certificates]] are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC|title=Renewables Obligation|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/eligibility/eligibility.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919160717/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/Eligibility/Eligibility.aspx|archivedate=2010-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC |title=The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314173910/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |archivedate=March 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt;

Hypothetically, the Woodward effect would allow for [[field propulsion]] [[spacecraft propulsion|spacecraft engines]] that would not have to expel matter. Such a proposed engine, is sometimes called a Mach effect [[spacecraft propulsion|thruster]] (MET) or a Mach Effect Gravitational Assist (MEGA) drive.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect is controversial within mainstream physics because the underlying mathematics appears faulty,&lt;ref name="whealton" /&gt; and the effect, if found to be real, would violate momentum conservation and energy conservation.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014" /&gt;

==Mach effects==
According to Woodward, at least three Mach effects are theoretically possible: vectored impulse thrust, open curvature of spacetime, and closed curvature of spacetime.&lt;ref name="MSAS"&gt;

The first effect, the Woodward effect, is the minimal energy effect of the hypothesis. The Woodward effect is focused primarily on proving the hypothesis and providing the basis of a Mach effect impulse thruster. In the first of three general Mach effects for propulsion or transport, the Woodward effect is an impulse effect usable for in-orbit satellite station-keeping, spacecraft reaction control systems, or at best, thrust within the solar system. The second and third effects are open and closed space-time effects. Open curved space-time effects can be applied in a field generation system to produce warp fields. Closed-curve space-time effects would be part of a field generation system to generate wormholes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The third Mach effect is a closed-curve [[spacetime]] effect or [[closed timelike curve]] called a benign wormhole. Closed-curve space is generally known as a [[wormhole]] or [[black hole]]. Prompted by [[Carl Sagan]] for the scientific basis of wormhole transport in the movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', [[Kip Thorne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kip S. Thorne |title=Kip Thorne personal web page |publisher=California Institute of Technology |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the theory of benign wormholes. The generation, stability, and traffic control of transport through a benign wormhole is only theoretical at present. One difficulty is the requirement for energy levels approximating a "Jupiter size mass".

[[Kenneth Nordtvedt]] showed in 1988 that [[gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitomagnetism]], which is an effect predicted by [[general relativity]] but hadn't yet been observed at that time and was even challenged by the scientific community, is inevitably a real effect because it is a direct consequence of the gravitational vector potential. He subsequently showed that the gravitomagnetism interaction (not to be confused with the [[Nordtvedt effect]]), like inertial [[frame dragging]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession]], is typically a Mach effect.&lt;ref name="Nordtvedt"&gt;

===Mach's principle===

The Woodward effect is based on the relativistic effects theoretically derived from [[Mach's principle]] on [[inertia]] within [[general relativity]], attributed by [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Ernst Mach]].&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture comes from a [[thought experiment]]:&lt;ref name="BoingBoing" /&gt;
{{quote
 |Ernst Mach (1838–1916) was an Austrian physicist […] contemporary of Einstein, to whom he suggested a thought experiment: What if there was only one object in the universe? Mach argued that it could not have a velocity, because according to the theory of relativity, you need at least two objects before you can measure their velocity relative to each other.

Taking this thought experiment a step further, if an object was alone in the universe, and it had no velocity, it could not have a measurable mass, because mass varies with velocity.

Mach concluded that inertial mass only exists because the universe contains multiple objects. When a gyroscope is spinning, it resists being pushed around because it is interacting with the Earth, the stars, and distant galaxies. If those objects didn't exist, the gyroscope would have no inertia.

Einstein was intrigued by this concept, and named it "Mach's principle."}}

===Gravitational origin of inertia===

A formulation of Mach's principle was first proposed as a vector theory of gravity, modeled on [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's formalism]] for [[classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]], by [[Dennis William Sciama|Dennis Sciama]] in 1953,&lt;ref name="Sciama 1953"&gt;

In this paper, Sciama stated that instantaneous inertial forces in all accelerating objects are produced by a primordial gravity-based inertial [[radiation|radiative]] [[field (physics)|field]] created by distant cosmic matter and propagating both forward ''and'' backward in time at light speed:

 |text=A first image to understand would be filming a sequence where a rock is thrown in the middle of a pond, making concentric ripples on the water propagating towards the shore.

Running the sequence backwards (thinking it as seeing events running backward in time) we then observe concentric waves propagating from the shore towards the center of the pond, where a rock emerges.

The thing to understand is that advanced waves coming back from the future never propagate farther into the past than the rock hitting the water that initiated all of the waves.

===Transient mass fluctuation===
The following has been detailed by Woodward in various peer-reviewed papers throughout the last twenty years.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"&gt;

 |title=Flux Capacitors and the Origin of Inertia

 |volume=34
 |issue=10
 |date=October 2004
 |pages=1475–1514
 |doi=10.1023/B:FOOP.0000044102.03268.46
 |url=http://www.enthea.org/docs/Woodward-Flux-Capacitors-Origin-Of-Inertia.pdf
 |bibcode= 2004FoPh...34.1475W
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Woodward, a transient mass fluctuation arises in an object when it absorbs "internal" energy as it is accelerated. Several devices could be built to [[accumulator (energy)|store internal energy]] during accelerations. A measurable effect needs to be driven at a high [[frequency]], so [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] [[mechanical system]]s are out of question since the rate at which their internal energy could be modified is too limited. The only systems that could run at a high frequency are [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy storage devices. For fast transient effects, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] are ruled out. A magnetic energy storage device like an [[inductor]] using a high-[[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] [[magnetic core|core material]] to transfer the [[magnetic energy]] could be specially built. But [[capacitor]]s are preferable to inductors because compact devices storing energy at a very high [[energy density]] without [[electrical breakdown]] are readily available. Shielding [[electromagnetic interference|electrical interferences]] are easier than [[magnetic shielding#Magnetic shielding|shielding magnetic]] ones. [[Ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] materials can be used to make high-frequency [[linear actuator#Electro-mechanical actuators|electro-mechanical actuators]], and they are themselves capacitors so they can be used for both energy storage and acceleration. Finally, capacitors are cheap and available in various configurations. So Mach effect experiments have always relied on capacitors so far.

When the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor is submitted to a varying [[electric power]] (charge or discharge), Woodward's hypothesis predicts&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt; a transient mass fluctuation arises according to the transient mass equation (TME):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta m_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi G}\left[\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant mass|proper mass]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
*&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the proper [[density]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous power delivered to the system.

This equation is not the full Woodward equation as seen in the book. There is a third term, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \frac{\phi}{c^2} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;which Woodward discounts because his [[gauge theory|gauge]] sets&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\phi}{c^2} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;; the derivatives of this quantity must therefore be negligible.&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt;

===Propellantless propulsion===
The previous equation shows that when the [[dielectric]] material of a [[capacitor]] is cyclically charged then discharged while being accelerated, its [[density|mass density]] fluctuates, by around plus or minus its [[invariant mass|rest mass]] value. Therefore, a device can be made to [[oscillate]] either in a linear or orbital path, such that its mass density is higher while the mass is moving forward, and lower while moving backward, thus creating an [[acceleration]] of the device in the forward direction, i.e. a thrust. This effect, used repeatedly, does not expel any [[particle]] and thus would represent a type of apparent [[reactionless drive|propellantless propulsion]], which seems to be in contradiction with [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]]. However, Woodward states there is no violation of momentum conservation in Mach effects:&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;
{{quote
 |If we produce a fluctuating mass in an object, we can, at least in principle, use it to produce a stationary force on the object, thereby producing a propulsive force thereon without having to expel propellant from the object. We simply push on the object when it is more massive, and pull back when it is less massive. The reaction forces during the two parts of the cycle will not be the same due to the mass fluctuation, so a time-averaged net force will be produced. ''This may seem to be a violation of momentum conservation. But the [[Lorentz invariance]] of the theory guarantees that no conservation law is broken. Local momentum conservation is preserved by the [[flux]] of [[momentum]] in the gravity field that is chiefly exchanged with the distant matter in the universe.'' [emphasis added]
}}

Two terms are important for propulsion on the right-hand side of the previous equation:
*The first, [[linear equation|linear term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[impulse (physics)|impulse]] engine'' term because it expresses mass fluctuation depending on the derivative of the power, and scales linearly with the frequency. Past and current experiments about Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]s are designed to demonstrate thrust and the control of one type of Mach effect.
*The second, [[quadratic equation|quadratic term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}&lt;/math&gt; is what Woodward calls the ''[[wormhole]]'' term, because ''it is always negative''. Although this term appears to be many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] weaker than the first term, which makes it usually negligible, theoretically, the second term's effect could become huge in some circumstances. The second term, the wormhole term, is indeed driven by the first impulse engine term, which fluctuates mass by around plus or minus the rest mass value. When fluctuations reach a very high amplitude and mass density is driven very close to zero, the equation shows that mass should achieve very large negative values very quickly, with a strong non-linear behavior. In this regard, the Woodward effect could generate [[exotic matter]], although this still remains very speculative due to the lack of any available experiment that would highlight such an effect.

Applications of propellantless propulsion include straight-line [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] or impulse engine, open curved fields for starship [[warp drive]]s, and even the possibility of closed curved fields such as traversable benign [[wormhole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Negative bare mass of the electron===

The mass of the electron is positive according to the [[mass–energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but this [[invariant mass]] is made from the [[bare mass]] of the electron "clothed" by a [[Virtual particle|virtual photon]] cloud. According to [[quantum field theory]], as those virtual particles have an energy more than twice the bare mass of the electron, mandatory for [[pair production]] in [[renormalization]], the nonelectromagnetic bare mass of the "unclothed" electron has to be ''negative''.&lt;ref name="Milonni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics|date=1994|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston|isbn=0124980805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|LCCN=93029780|oclc=422797902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[ADM formalism]], Woodward proposes that the physical interpretation of the "wormhole term" in his transient mass equation could be a way to expose the negative bare mass of the electron, in order to produce large quantities of exotic matter that could be used in a warp drive to propel a spacecraft or generate traversable wormholes.&lt;ref name="Woodward2011" /&gt;

==Space travel==
Current [[spacecraft]] achieve a change in velocity by the expulsion of [[propellant]], the extraction of momentum from stellar [[radiation pressure]] or the [[stellar wind]] or the utilisation of a [[gravity assist]] ("slingshot") from a planet or moon. These methods are limiting in that [[rocket propellant]]s have to be accelerated as well and are eventually depleted, and the stellar wind or the gravitational fields of planets can only be utilized locally in the [[Solar System]]. In [[interstellar space]] and bereft of the above resources, different forms of propulsion are needed to propel a spacecraft, and they are referred to as advanced or [[interstellar travel#Faster-than-light travel: warped spacetime and wormholes|exotic]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Impulse engine===
If the Woodward effect is confirmed and if an engine can be designed to use applied Mach effects, then a spacecraft may be possible that could maintain a steady acceleration into and through interstellar space without the need to carry along propellants. Woodward presented a paper about the concept at the [[NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] Workshop conference in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;

Even ignoring for the moment the impact on [[interstellar travel]], future spacecraft driven by impulse engines based on Mach effects would represent an astounding breakthrough in terms of [[interplanetary spaceflight]] alone, enabling the rapid [[space colonization|colonization]] of the entire solar system. Travel times being limited only by the specific power of the available power supplies and the acceleration human physiology can endure, they would allow crews to reach any moon or planet in our solar system in less than three weeks. For example, a typical one-way trip at an acceleration of [[g-force|1 g]] from the Earth to the [[Moon]] would last only about 4 hours; to [[Mars]], 2 to 5 days; to the [[asteroid belt]], 5 to 6 days; and to [[Jupiter]], 6 to 7 days.&lt;ref name="March2007"&gt;

===Warp drives and wormholes===
As shown by the transient mass fluctuation equation above, exotic matter could be theoretically created. A large quantity of negative [[energy density]] would be the key element needed to create warp drives&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if proven to be scientifically valid, practically feasible and scaling as predicted by the hypothesis, the Woodward effect could not only be used for interplanetary travel, but also for apparent [[faster-than-light]] interstellar travel:
*The [[negative mass]] could be used to warp spacetime around a spaceship according to an [[Alcubierre metric]].&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"/&gt;
*Enough exotic matter could also be concentrated into a point of space to create a [[wormhole]], and prevent it from collapsing. Woodward and others also state that exotic matter could defocus energy at the outer mouth of the [[wormhole]] (making it a [[white hole]]) and shape the throat of such a [[gravitational singularity]] flat enough to avoid [[event horizon|horizon]] and [[tidal force|tidal]] stresses, resulting in an "absurdly benign traversable [[wormhole]]" linking two regions of distant spacetime, a concept widespread in science fiction as [[Jumpgate|stargate]]s, which could be used for instant interstellar and intergalactic travel or [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="MSAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward and his associates have claimed since the 1990s to have successfully measured forces at levels great enough for practical use and also claim to be working on the development of a practical prototype [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]. No practical working devices have yet been publicly demonstrated.&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;

The NIAC contract awarded in 2017 by [[NASA]] for the development of Mach effect thrusters is a primary three-task effort, two experimental and one analytical:&lt;ref name="NIAC 2017 Mach Effect" /&gt;

# Improvement of the current laboratory-scale devices, in order to provide long duration thrust at levels required for practical propulsion applications.
# Design and development of a power supply and electrical systems to provide feedback and control of the input AC voltage, and resonant frequency, that determine the efficiency of the MET.
# Improve theoretical thrust predictions and build a reliable model of the device to assist in perfecting the design. Predict maximum thrust achievable by one device and how large an array of thrusters would be required to send a probe, of size 1.5 m diameter by 3 m, of total mass 1245&amp;nbsp;kg including a modest 400&amp;nbsp;kg of payload, a distance of 8 light-years away.

==Experiments==

===Test devices===

====Mach-Lorentz Thruster====
[[File:Woodward Effect Device.png|thumb|right|Photograph of the 2006 Woodward effect MLT test article.]]
A former type of Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] was the Mach-Lorentz thruster (MLT). It used a charging [[capacitor]] embedded in a magnetic field created by a magnetic coil. A Lorentz force, the cross product between the electric field and the magnetic field, appears and acts upon the ions inside the capacitor dielectric. In such electromagnetic experiments, the power can be applied at frequencies of several megahertz, unlike [[PZT]] stack actuators where frequency is limited to tens of kilohertz. The photograph shows the components of a Woodward effect test article used in a 2006 experiment.&lt;ref name="AIP1"/&gt;

However, a problem with some of these devices was discovered in 2007 by physicist Nembo Buldrini, who called it the ''Bulk Acceleration Conjecture'':
{{quote
 |What [Nembo Buldrini] pointed out was that given the way the transient terms of the Mach effect equation are written – in terms of the time-derivatives of the proper energy density – it is easy to lose sight of the requirement in the derivation that the object in which the mass fluctuations occur must be accelerating at the same time. In some of the experimental cases, no provision for such "bulk" acceleration was made.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; As an example, the capacitors affixed to the tines of the tuning fork in the Cramer and the students' experiments made no provision for such an acceleration. Had the tuning fork been separately excited and an electric field applied to the capacitor(s) been properly phased, an effect might have been seen. But to simply apply a voltage to the capacitors and then look for a response in the tuning fork should not have been expected to produce a compelling result.

Other examples could be cited and discussed. Suffice it to say, though, that after Nembo focused attention in the issue of bulk accelerations in the production of Mach effects, the design and execution of experiments changed. The transition to that work, and recent results of experiments presently in progress, are addressed in the next chapter.

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; By "bulk" acceleration we are referring to the fact that the conditions of the derivation include that the object be both accelerated and experience internal energy changes. The acceleration of ions in the material of a capacitor, for example, does not meet this condition. The capacitor as a whole must be accelerated in bulk while it is being polarized.

====Mach Effect Thruster or MEGA drive====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:All PZT Mach effect thruster test unit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Photograph of the PZT stack of a Mach effect test device.]] --&gt;
To address this issue, Woodward started to design and build a new kind of device known as a MET (Mach Effect Thruster) and later a MEGA drive (Mach Effect Gravitational Assist drive), using capacitors and a series of thick [[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] disks. This ceramic is [[piezoelectric]], so it can be used as an electromechanical actuator to accelerate an object placed against it: its [[crystal structure|crystalline structure]] expands when a certain [[electrical polarity]] is applied, then contracts when the opposite field is applied, and the stack of discs vibrates.

In the first tests, Woodward simply used a [[capacitor]] between two stacks of PZT disks. The capacitor, while being electrically charged to change its internal energy density, is shuttled back and forth between the PZT actuators. [[Piezoelectric]] materials can also generate a measurable voltage potential across their two faces when pressed, so Woodward first used some small portions of PZT material as little [[accelerometer]]s put on the surface of the stack, to precisely tune the device with the power supply. Then Woodward realized that PZT material and the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor were very similar, so he built devices that are made exclusively of PZT disks, without any conventional capacitor, applying different signals to different portions of the cylindrical stack. The available picture taken by his graduate student Tom Mahood in 1999 shows a typical all-PZT stack with different disks:&lt;ref name=mahood&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/
 |title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton

 |accessdate=27 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The outer, thicker disks on the left and right are the "shuttlers".
*The inner stack of thin disks in the center are the shuttled capacitors storing energy during acceleration, where any mass shift would occur.
*The even thinner disks placed between the shuttlers and on both side of the inner disk capacitors are the "squeezometers' acting as accelerometers.
During forward acceleration and before the transient mass change in the capacitor decays, the resultant increased [[momentum]] is transferred forward to a bulk "reaction mass" through an [[elastic collision]] (the [[brass]] end cap on the left in the picture). Conversely, the following decrease in the mass density takes place during its backward movement.
While operating, the PZT stack is isolated in a Faraday cage and put on a sensitive [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm for thrust measurements, inside a vacuum chamber. Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to [[ballistic pendulum]]s to multiple [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2013"/&gt;

In the future, Woodward plans to scale thrust levels, switching from the current [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[dielectric]] [[ceramic]]s ([[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] stacks) to new [[high-κ dielectric]] [[nanocomposite]] [[polymer]]s, like [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN]], [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN-PT]] or [[calcium copper titanate|CCTO]]. Nevertheless, such materials are new, quite difficult to find, and are [[electrostriction|electrostrictive]], not piezoelectric.&lt;ref name="Scaling"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and a NIAC phase I grant was awarded in April 2017 to develop a better theoretical model and technical solutions for greater efficiency as a [[Technology readiness level|TRL-1 technology]]: reduction of heating and longer operating time using ''chirped pulses''; and design of a dedicated electronic circuit with better frequency impedance matching. The concept of an interstellar mission to [[Proxima Centauri b]] was also detailed. Consecutively to these achievements, a NIAC Phase II grant was awarded in March 2018 to test an improved design with a higher operational frequency to increase the output thrust.&lt;ref name="NIAC 2018 Mach Effect" /&gt;

====EmDrive====
{{main|RF resonant cavity thruster}}
Another type of claimed propellantless thruster, called the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]] by its inventor British engineer Roger Shawyer, has been proposed to work due to a Mach effect:&lt;ref name="IBT EmDrive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hacked EmDrive" /&gt;

The asymmetric resonant [[microwave cavity]] would act as a capacitor where:
* surface currents propagate inside the cavity on the conic wall between the two end plates,
* electromagnetic resonant modes create electric charges on each end plate,
* a Mach effect is triggered by [[Lorentz force]]s from surface currents on the conic wall,
* a thrust force arises in the [[Radio frequency|RF]] cavity, due to the variation of the electromagnetic density from [[Evanescent field|evanescent wave]]s inside the skin layer.
When a [[polymer]] insert is placed asymmetrically in the cavity, its dielectric properties result in greater asymmetry, while decreasing the cavity [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].
The cavity's acceleration is a function of all the above factors, and the model can explain the acceleration of the cavity with and without a dielectric.&lt;ref name="Montillet 2016" /&gt;

===Results===
From his initial paper onward Woodward has claimed that this effect is detectable with modern technology.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt; He and others have performed and continue to perform experiments to detect the small forces that are predicted to be produced by this effect. So far some groups claim to have detected forces at the levels predicted and other groups have detected forces at much greater than predicted levels or nothing at all. To date there has been no announcement conclusively confirming proof for the existence of this effect or ruling it out.&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;

*In 1990, Woodward's original paper on Mach effects included an experiment with results.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt;
*In 1999, Thomas L. Mahood, Woodward's [[graduate student]] from 1997 to 1999, reported thrusts ranging from 0.03 to 15&amp;nbsp;µN in a setup comprising a torque pendulum in a vacuum chamber, at the [[Space Technology and Applications International Forum]] (STAIF) and in his [[Master of Science|Master of Science in Physics]] [[thesis]].&lt;ref name="Mahood1999"&gt;

*In 2004, [[John G.

==Debate==

===Inertial frames===
All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion with respect to one another; they are not accelerating in the sense that an accelerometer at rest in one would detect zero acceleration. Despite their ubiquitous nature, inertial frames are still not fully understood. That they exist is certain, but what causes them to exist – and whether these sources could constitute reaction-media – are still unknown. Marc Millis, of the NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]], stated " ''For example, the notion of thrusting without propellant evokes objections of violating conservation of momentum. This, in turn, suggests that space drive research must address conservation of momentum. From there it is found that many relevant unknowns still linger regarding the source of the inertial frames against which conservation is referenced. Therefore, research should revisit the unfinished physics of inertial frames, but in the context of propulsive interactions.'' "&lt;ref name="Millis2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mach's principle]] is generally defined within [[general relativity]] as "the local inertia frame is completely determined by the dynamic fields in the universe." Rovelli evaluated a number of versions of "Mach's principle" that exist in the literature. Some are partially correct and some have been dismissed as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Rovelli, Carlo 2004"/&gt;

===Conservation of momentum===

A challenge to the mathematical foundations of Woodward's hypothesis were raised in a paper published by the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 2001. In the paper, John Whealton noted that the experimental results of Oak Ridge scientists can be explained in terms of force contributions due to time-varying [[thermal expansion]], and stated that a laboratory demonstration produced 100 times the Woodward effect without resorting to non-Newtonian explanations.&lt;ref name="whealton"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Woodward published a criticism of Whealton's math and understanding of the physics involved, and built an experiment attempting to demonstrate the flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13020.0;attach=119594

&lt;/ref&gt;

A rate of change in [[momentum]] represents a force, whereby '''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''. Whealton et al. use the technical definition, '''F'''{{=}}d(''m'''''v''')/d''t'', which can be expanded to '''F'''{{=}}''m'' d'''v'''/d''t'' + d''m''/d''t'' '''v'''. This second term has both delta mass and '''v''', which is measured instantaneously; this term will, in general, cancel out the force from the inertial response terms predicted by Woodward. Woodward argued that the d''m''/d''t'' '''v''' term does not represent a physical force on the device, because it vanishes in a frame where the device is momentarily stationary.&lt;ref name=Woodward2004b/&gt;

In an appendix to his thesis, Mahood argues that the unexpectedly small magnitude of the results in his experiments are a confirmation of the cancellation predicted by Whealton; the results are instead due to higher-order mass transients which are not exactly cancelled.&lt;ref name="MahoodThesis"/&gt; Mahood would later describe this argument as "one of the very few things I've done in my life that I actually regret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahood|first1=Thomas|title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton|url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/|website=Other Hand|accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the momentum and energy exchange with distant matter guarantees global conservation of energy and momentum, this [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is supplied at no material cost, unlike the case with conventional fuels. For this reason, when the [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is ignored, a propellantless thruster behaves locally like a free energy device. This is immediately apparent from basic Newtonian analysis: if constant power produces constant thrust, then input energy is linear with time and output (kinetic) energy is quadratic with time. Thus there exists a break-even time (or distance or velocity) of operation, above which more energy is output than is input. The longer it is allowed to accelerate, the more pronounced will this effect become, as simple Newtonian physics predicts.

Considering those conservation issues, a Mach effect thruster relies on Mach's principle, hence it is not an electrical to kinetic [[transducer]], i.e. it does not convert [[electric energy]] to [[kinetic energy]]. Rather, a Mach effect thruster is a gravinertial [[transistor]] that controls the flow of gravinertial [[flux]], in and out of the active mass of the thruster. The primary power into the thruster is contained in the flux of the [[gravitational field]], not the electricity that powers the device. Failing to account for this flux, is much the same as failing to account for the [[wind]] on a [[sail]].&lt;ref name="Stahl 2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mach effects are relativistic by nature, and considering a spaceship accelerating with a Mach effect thruster, the propellant is not accelerating with the ship, so the situation should be treated as an accelerating and therefore [[non-inertial reference frame]], where '''F''' does not equal ''m'''''a'''. Keith H. Wanser, professor of physics at California State University, Fullerton, published a paper in 2013 concerning the conservation issues of Mach effect thrusters.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014"&gt;{{cite journal

==Quantum mechanics==
In 2009, [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold "Sonny" White]] of [[NASA]] proposed the Quantum Vacuum Fluctuation (QVF) conjecture, a non-relativistic hypothesis based on quantum mechanics to produce momentum fluxes even in empty [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where Sciama's gravinertial field of [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] is used in the Woodward effect, the White conjecture replaces the Sciama gravinertial field with the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]] field. The local reactive forces are generated and conveyed by momentum fluxes created in the QED vacuum field by the same process used to create momentum fluxes in the gravinertial field. White uses [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[right-hand rule|rules]] to quantify this local momentum interaction where in comparison Woodward applies [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name="Sonny2011"/&gt;

Based on the White conjecture, the proposed theoretical device is called a [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] (QVPT) or Q-thruster. No experiments have been performed to date.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Unlike a Mach effect thruster instantaneously exchanging momentum with the distant cosmic matter through the advanced/retarded waves ([[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]]) of the radiative gravinertial field, Sonny's "Q-thruster" would appear to violate momentum conservation, for the thrust would be produced by pushing off virtual "Q" particle/antiparticle pairs that would annihilate after they have been pushed on. However, it would not necessarily violate the law of conservation of energy, as it requires an electric current to function, much like any "standard" MHD thruster, and cannot produce more kinetic energy than its equivalent net energy input.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Woodward and Fearn showed why the amount of [[electron]]-[[positron]] [[pair production|virtual pairs]] of the quantum vacuum, used by White as a virtual plasma propellant, cannot account for thrusts in any isolated, closed electromagnetic system such as the QVPT or the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]].&lt;ref name="JBIS 2016a"&gt;
