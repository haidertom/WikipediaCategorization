Thus, it is often used to limit or contradict fault in a matter.

Other examples include:
*"The current world is in a state of chaos, but that's understandable, since humans have got a lot less organized, more stupid, and more populous".
*"The building was coming down anyway."

Anangeon can be seen as a part of [[logos]] and is a type of [[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]].

'''Apophantic''' ({{lang-el|ἀποφαντικός}}, "declaratory", from ἀποφαίνειν ''apophainein'', "to show, to make known") is a term [[Aristotle]] coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a [[logical proposition]] or phenomenon. It was adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] as part of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defines it as "the logic of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm5.html "One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence "All [[penguins]] are [[birds]]," and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence "All [[bachelors]] are unhappy." In the first proposition, the subject is ''penguins'' and the predicate is ''birds'', and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should [[Logical truth|necessarily]] be put. In the second proposition, the subject is ''bachelors'' and the predicate is ''unhappy''.  This is a subjective, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies "All penguins are birds" as more truthful than "All bachelors are unhappy." One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

The concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as ''jâzim'', or 'truth-apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ "Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armchair theorizing''', '''armchair philosophizing''', or '''armchair scholarship''' is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nadel|1956|p=173}}, who defines ''armchair anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commentary and analysis ==
Different disciplines place different weight on purely theoretical research. Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]] argue that purely theoretical anthropological research is outdated and that [[ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] should be a necessary part of anthropological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ingold|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some commentators argue that [[economic theory|economic theories]] are designed to explain and predict economic phenomena, which requires analysis and synthesis, and not necessarily collection, of data.  [[Leland B. Yeager]] even argues that economists can legitimately extrapolate from their own personal observations to design new theories.  In this sense, Yeager sees armchair theorizing as something better than the "mere sterile juggling of arbitrary assumptions" saying that "it can have a sound empirical basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469376/pg_9 Henry George and Austrian economics - History of Thought], ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', Dec, 2001  by [[Leland B. Yeager]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While armchair scholarship contrasts with the [[scientific method]], which inherently involves the active investigation of the nature through data collection, armchair philosophers and theorizers can assist in formulating theories that explain observations; these theories can then be tested with further scientific investigation. While the methods of the armchair philosopher are different from those of the scientist, they can complement each other to produce new insights and discover necessary truths, whether they are empirical or theoretical.

'''Brynjólfur Bjarnason''' (26 May 1898 – 16 April 1989) was an [[Iceland]]ic communist politician. He became a student at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and in 1923 he became a communist during a stay in Berlin. After returning to Iceland, he became a teacher. In 1930 he became the chairman of the [[Communist Party of Iceland]] when it was founded.&lt;ref name="lazi"&gt;Lazitch, Branko. ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern''. [[Stanford]]: [[The Hoover Institution Press]], 1986. p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Bjarnason attended the 2nd congress of the [[Communist International]] in 1920 and the 5th congress in 1924, as the representative of the Icelandic League of young communists. In 1935 he represented the Icelandic party at the 7th congress of the [[Communist International]]. In 1938 he became general secretary of the [[Popular Unity Party - Socialist Party]] (formed through the unification of communists and socialists).&lt;ref name="lazi"/&gt;

Bjarnason was elected to the Icelandic parliament [[Alþingi]] in 1937 and was a member until 1956. He served as Minister of Education 1944–1947.&lt;ref name="lazi"/&gt;

After his retirement from politics he wrote several books on philosophy.

'''Byzantinism''', or '''Byzantism''', is the political system and culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its spiritual successors, in particular, the Christian [[Balkan]] states ([[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]]) and Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and most importantly, [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name=dim3&gt;Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe'', in Dimitris Keridis, [[Ellen Elias-Bursać]], Nicholas Yatromanolakis, ''New approaches to Balkan studies'', Brassey's, 2003, {{ISBN|1-57488-724-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim11&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''byzantinism'' itself was coined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=dim8&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has primarily negative associations, implying complexity and [[autocracy]].

This negative reputation stressed the confusing complexities of the Empire's [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|ministries]] and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies. Likewise, the "Byzantine system" also suggests a penchant for intrigue, plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs. The term has been criticized by modern scholars for being a [[generalization]] that is not very representative of the reality of the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name=dim6&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.17–18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristocracy and bureaucracy==
{{Main|Byzantine bureaucracy}}

The [[Byzantine Empire]] is a modern term applied by Westerners to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (that survived a thousand years after the western one collapsed in 476) and thus had a complex system of [[aristocracy]] and [[bureaucracy]] which was derived from earlier [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems. At the apex of the pyramid stood the [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]], sole ruler and divinely ordained, and beneath him a multitude of officials and court functionaries operated the administrative machinery of the state. A key component of state power was the prestige of the Imperial institution and its long antiquity. Ceremony and the granting of both honorific titles and valuable offices was therefore extensive and elaborate.

Over the nearly fifteen hundred years of the empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. By the time of [[Heraclius]] in the 7th century many of the early Roman titles, grounded in the Latin language and the traditions of the old Roman republic had become obsolete in the now mostly Greek-speaking empire, although Latin survived longer in law and in the military. Heraclius formally changed the official language to Greek from Latin in 620. Titles inspired by their Greek tradition, often only rough approximation of Latin concepts, became common (i.e. "basileus" [βασιλεύς] instead of "caesar" or "augustus" for the title of the emperor himself). Other titles changed meaning (for example, "Patriarch") or were devalued with time (such as "consul").

Among important qualities of the Empire was also the [[caesaropapism]], the subjugation of church to the state.&lt;ref name=dim4-5&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[Byzantine Empire]] acquired a negative reputation in the [[Western world]] as early as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim7&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and the [[East–West Schism]] in the 11th century made the Empire an outcast to the Western European countries following the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], and the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege and sack of Constantinopole]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 only cemented those differences.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt; Hence the European medieval stereotypes of the people of the Byzantine Empire portrayed them as perfidious, treacherous, servile, effeminate and unwarlike.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt;

Medievalist [[Steven Runciman]] described the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]an view of the Byzantine Empire by saying:
{{quote|Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw [[Constantinople]] and met, to their contemptuous disgust, a society where everyone read and wrote, ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war, it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence.|[[Steven Runciman]], ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', 1988&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-521-35722-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHVzWN6gqxQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Ever+since+our+rough+crusading+forefathers+first+saw%22&amp;ei=Xp8JSseLL4SSzQSa2LH4Cw Google Print, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Criticism of the Empire continued among historians of the 18th century and 19th century, particularly in the works of historians and philosophers influenced by [[The Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Hegel]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[William Lecky]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]] were among the many Western writers of that period who were critical of the Byzantine system.&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford history of Byzantium'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-814098-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6-kHUyyUIsC&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=Edward+Gibbon+decadent+Byzantium&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=tqgJSr3kAqG2zQTqzeiQDw Google Print, p.v]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Gibbon]], the first English historian to write a full [[history of the Byzantine Empire]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–1789), was a sharp critic of the Empire.&lt;ref name=dim9&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Burckhardt]], an influential 19th-century historian shared Gibbon's view:

{{quote|At its summit was despotism, infinitely strengthened by the union of churchly and secular dominion; in the place of morality it imposed orthodoxy; in the place of unbridled and demoralized expression of the natural instincts, hypocrisy and pretense; in the face of despotism there was developed greed masquerading as poverty, and deep cunning; in religious art and literature there was an incredible stubbornness in the constant repetition of obsolete motifs.|[[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''The age of Constantine the Great''&lt;ref name=dim10&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;vq=stubbornness&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics pointed out that the Byzantine Empire and its successors were uninfluenced by such major shifts in Western philosophy as the [[Investiture Controversy]], the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Renaissance]];&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt; and reduced the Byzantine political culture to [[caesaropapism]] and authoritarian political culture, described as [[authoritarian]], [[despotism|despotic]], and [[imperialist]]ic.&lt;ref name=dim9/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim10/&gt;

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, critics of the Byzantine system pointed out that it has survived and "corrupted" other states, in particular, it has been used in the discourse of the political system, culture and society of the [[Russia]] (from the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] through the [[tsardom of Russia]] to the [[Russian Empire]] – see also [[tsarist autocracy]]),&lt;ref name=dim11/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim12&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=dim13&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.13]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balkan]] states (the former European [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]]).&lt;ref name=dim3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim4-5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians point out that this negative reputation is not necessarily true, and at the very least, a very simplistic [[generalization]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718/&gt; As a [[social constructivism|constructed term]], Byzantinism also shares those fallacies with a closely related term, [[Balkanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Angelov sums it up as follows:

{{quote|Byzantinism begins from simple stereotypes, passes through [[reductionism]] and [[essentialization]], and then proceeds to impute Byzantium's supposed essence onto modern Balkans or Russia as the burden of history. ... As a discourse of "otherness", Byzantinism evolves from, and reflects upon, the West's worst dreams and nightmares about its own self.|Dimiter G. Angelov, ''Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe''&lt;ref&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.13–14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Praise==
While the Byzantine Empire was commonly seen in a negative fashion, there were exceptions. Byzantium was rehabilitated in France during the [[Age of Absolutism]], from the 17th century to the [[French Revolution]], in the works of such individuals as the [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Poussines]].&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;

As the Enlightenment swept Western Europe, French traditions found refuge in the [[Russian Empire]]. The term Byzantinism was used in a positive context by 19th-century Russian scholar [[Konstantin Leontiev]] in ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875) to describe the type of society which [[Russian Empire]] needs to counter the [[liberalism|degenerating influence]] of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref name=dim12/&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-12269-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1yCrMAfg_IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, pp.148–149]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev praised the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[tsarist autocracy]], and a society and political system that comprises authoritative power of the monarch, devout following of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the maintenance of [[obshchina]] for peasants, and sharp class division; he also criticized [[universal education]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=pipes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

{{quote|When we mentally picture Byzantinism we see before us as if... the austere, clear plan of a spacious and capacious structure. We know, for example, that in politics it means autocracy. In religion, it means Christianity with distinct features, which distinguish it from Western churches, from heresies and schisms. In the area of ethics we know that the Byzantine ideal does not have that elevated and in many instances highly exaggerated notion of terrestrial human individual introduced into history by German feudalism. We know the inclination of the Byzantine ethical ideal to be disappointed in all that is of this world, in happiness, in the constancy of our own purity, in our capacity here, below, to attain complete moral perfection. We know that Byzantinism (as Christianity in general) rejects all hope of the universal well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of humanity in the sense of universal worldly equality, universal worldly freedom, universal worldly perfectibility, and universal contentment. |[[Konstantin Leontiev]], ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875)}}

In Russian political discourse, Russia is sometimes affectionately called ''[[Third Rome]]'', the second Rome being the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlived its western counterpart at Rome itself, the first Rome, by a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Raphael Johnson, ''The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism and Orthodoxy'', The Foundation for Economic Liberty, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9742303-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Pavlov, ''[http://www.eusanz.org/pdf/conf02/pavlov_eusanz_2002.pdf The new Third Rome?

In his article, "Was There Ever Byzantinism?" Alexander Mirkovic argued that many Western authors have created an imagined picture of Byzantium as a projection of their own anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108000000/http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |archivedate=2018-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mesa Redonda en Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|Carlos Pérez Soto in a seminar in Germany, which was organized by [[medico international]]]]
'''Carlos Pérez Soto''' (born October 6, 1954 in [[Santiago de Chile]]) is a Chilean teacher of [[physics]], lecturer at various universities and a social sciences researcher, author of works of a broad thematic spectrum: [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]], [[political philosophy]] and [[Marxism]], [[history of dance]], [[anti-psychiatry]].

== Biography ==

In 1972 he joined the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Chile]] for the career of Pedagogy in Physics. In 1979, he obtained the state degree of a (qualified) Teacher of Physics, which is his only formal academic degree. Although he began his studies in the heyday of the student movement's political participation during the government of [[Salvador Allende]], he spent most of his life as a student during the years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chilean military dictatorship]].

Between 1975 and 1999 he worked as a secondary school teacher of physics in schools and colleges of Santiago.

[[File:Fenomenologia 1.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos Pérez Soto teaches a class on [[Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']]

In 1984, he began teaching in higher education at the Institute of Arts and Social Sciences, which gathered intellectuals who opposed Pinochet's dictatorship and which in 1991 became the University known until today as [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS]]. He continued as a university professor, teaching epistemology and philosophy of science in psychology departments, first at the [[Diego Portales University]] and later at the [[University of Chile]]. In the late 80's he was already well known among students and scholars for his critical approach, his Marxist analysis and concrete policy proposals. In this context, he received invitations to give lectures and conferences at numerous Chilean universities so that the following years were characterized by an intense teaching activity.

In the last decade he has taught regular courses and elective seminars at the [[University of Chile]] (Faculty of Law),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derecho.uchile.cl/pregrado/secretaria-de-estudios/53916/ciencias-del-derecho-curriculum  Academic curriculum at the website of the University of Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |title=On Carlos Pérez Soto at the web site of the Faculty of Law |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045122/http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Catholic University of Valparaiso]] (School of Psychology), the [[Andrés Bello National University]] (School of Sociology), at [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]] (Department of Philosophy), [[Academy of Christian Humanism University]] (Dance School) and at the [[Finis Terrae University]] (School of Theatre).

In the late 90's he also started giving some seminars and conferences outside Chile, at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] on Hegel (1997) and Marxism (1999), as well as in Cali, at the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] on epistemology and dialectics (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf  Texto de seminario en Cali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323033746/http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}, formato PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tumba de Hegel.jpg|thumb| Pérez Soto by Hegel's tomb in [[Berlin]]]]

At the ARCIS University, where he has focused his academic work, besides teaching in regular courses at the School of Psychology, (Psychological Theories and Systems) and the School of Sociology (Epistemology; Classics of social thought - Marx, Science, Technology and society), Philosophy (Philosophy of Science), Political Science (Theory of power and the state) and Pedagogy of Dance (Dance History), he served as senior researcher at the Center for Social Research as well as Coordinator of Academic Informatics.

As a Marxist intellectual he has been interviewed with some frequency by the leftist press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puntofinal.cl/676/cambio.php Entrevista en Revista Punto final] diciembre de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because he has made relevant theoretical contributions to the political discussion. In the context of the student movement of 2011 and 2012, he actively participated providing analysis and proposals for the transformation of the Chilean educational model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanidades.uach.cl/2012/11/14/carlos-perez-dictara-charla-magistral-sobre-educacion/ Clase magistral] en la [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] sobre la transformación del modelo educativo] 15 de noviembre de 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His class analysis of the kind of society that is set under the neoliberal economic model has attracted the interest of international organizations for him to lecture on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio.uchile.cl/2013/10/07/40-anos-de-modelo-neoliberal-en-chile  Nota en el Diario Universidad de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile Carlos Pérez dictó charlas en Alemania sobre 40 años de neoliberalismo en Chile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323051620/http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile |date=March 23, 2014 }} Boletín de noticias de la Universidad Arcis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medico.de/themen/aktion/konferenzen/dokumente/chile-im-wandel/4478/ Seminario de [[medico international]]] 16 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faitesvotrejeu.blogsport.de/2013/09/11/donnerstag-12-september-2013-19-uhr-von-chile-lernen-neoliberalismus-und-protest/ ''Aprender de Chile: Neoliberalismo y protesta''] Foro en Frankfurt,12 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among scholars of [[Hegel]] and of the reception of Hegel and [[Marx]] at the [[Frankfurt School]], particularly by [[Herbert Marcuse]], Carlos Perez is a regular speaker at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2003/10/03/125010/conferencia-internacional-adorno-100-anos-en-el-goethe-institut.html Conferencia internacional, "Adorno, 100 años", en el Goethe-Institut] El Mercurio, 3 de octubre de 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/02/04/index.php?section=opinion&amp;article=002a2cor Anuncio del curso “Hegel y las ciencias sociales” ] Universidad autónoma de México, febrero de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the vast educational activity in regular and elective courses at the universities, there is a number of free biannual seminars, which he has been giving since 2009 about the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' of Hegel, on Marxism and [[Psychoanalysis]], Critical Theory of Law, History of Marxism, [[Carl Sagan]]: Introduction to the current natural philosophy.

Since 2009 he also teaches as a professor of epistemology in several graduate programs (masters and doctorate) at the university Andrés Bello&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/  Presentación de Pérez Soto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323062217/http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/# |date=2014-03-23 }} en un programa de postgrado de la Universidad Andrés Bello&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS University]], addressing in his classes and seminars the critical reflection on methodological aspects of the social sciences. He usually presents himself as a teacher of physics, which intends to be "a provocation against the academic ''establishment''", as he has declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elciudadano.cl/2012/07/01/54474/carlos-perez-soto-a-la-senora-bachelet-no-le-conviene-ser-presidenta/# |title=Entrevista en “El Ciudadano”: ''A la señora Bachelet no le conviene ser presidenta |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516210728/http://www.elciudadano.cl/2012/07/01/54474/carlos-perez-soto-a-la-senora-bachelet-no-le-conviene-ser-presidenta/# |archive-date=2014-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national press, however, prefers to cite him as "a great epistemologist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.emol.com/vermas/El%20Mercurio/Magazine/2007-11-18/046869bf-3db2-4012-87c3-7528072a8b40/Evidencias_y_clarividencias/ Evidencias y Clarividencias] El Mercurio, 18 de noviembre de 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical contribution and main ideas ==

In epistemology, he has developed a historical and dialectical analysis of the concept of science, more precisely:

* The development of the idea that the scientific method should be considered as a logic for the legitimation of the scientific community; 
* the proposal for a rational reconstruction of the history of philosophy of science from which it is possible to criticize the claim to truth that follows the scientific method; 
* the development of a historical concept of science based on a Marxist critique of the epistemological anarchism of Paul Feyerabend; 
* the formulation of a critique of the prevailing public subjectivity of the middle classes starting from a historical and social concept of modern psychology.

From a political point of view, Carlos Pérez places his theoretical approach and proposals for the political practice in the "Hegelian Marxism", a stance which, as he points out, could be constituted within the philosophical foundations for the purpose of the emergence of a new type of Marxism. Here the following contributions stand out:
* The idea that the bureaucracy should be considered a social class in the Marxist sense of the term; 
* the formulation of a Marxist critique of the ruling regime in socialist countries, based on the concept of bureaucracy as a class; 
* conducting a review of the processes of objective bureaucratization occurred in advanced capitalism; 
* the proposal of the reconstruction of Marxist theory based on a materialist reading of Hegel's philosophy.

His proposals for a new anti-psychiatry are also a political program. They focus on a profound critique of the psychiatric practices, on the need for an unmedicalization and de-privatization of the symptoms, in order to return the problems to the scope of their actual causes, origins and perpetuation: the social sphere. Among other differences with the anti-psychiatry postulates of the twentieth century ( [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]], [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|Cooper]] or [[Franco Basaglia|Basaglia]]), the "new" anti-psychiatry that Perez Soto promotes is one that also overcomes the paternalistic aspects of the psychiatric house as a "shelter", going beyond the logic of organizing a more humane or better quality psychiatric care, paving the way for an anti-psychiatry which arises from the persons themselves that are affected. Apart from a summary and historical connection of the different moments of critical psychiatry and anti-psychiatry, two specific contributions of Carlos Perez stand out:
* The development of a critique of the medicalization processes of behavioral disturbances; 
* the proposal of distinctions to criticize the medicalization and commodification of modern medicine.

The following contributions in the field of art and dance are important: 
* His proposal of a theoretically founded reconstruction of modern dance history in its European tradition and throughout the twentieth century; 
* his proposal of technical style distinctions in contemporary dance; 
* his proposals or theoretical distinctions regarding the political art, political use of art and particular politics of the art guild itself.

With his second book ''Comentar obras de danza'' (Discussing Works of Dance), he ended his excursion through the history of dance. As he explains, because he wants to return to the core of his developments. 
{{cita|I usually write about Marxism, that's the center of all my thoughts. From there I ventured into epistemology and philosophy of science, critical psychology and anti-psychiatry. From now on I will probably write more about the Hegelian philosophy, to which I have devoted many years of study. Except in the most general subjects of aesthetics and art history, this book marks for me the end of a period, and a farewell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">The balance of '''Competing goods''' is a philosophical problem involving the acknowledgement of multiple social values that may at times conflict with one another.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&amp;f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13507">{{short description|The hypothetical ability of the human species to choose what they will become}}

Conscious evolution refers to the ability of the human species to choose what the species [[Homo sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] will become in the future, based on recent advancements in science, medicine, technology, psychology, sociology, and spirituality. Most leading thinkers in this area have focused on the conscious evolution of how we think, live, organize ourselves, work together, and address issues, rather than on [[evolution|biological evolution]]. 

The idea of conscious evolution is not a specific theory, but it has loose connections to [[Ervin László|integral theory]], [[Spiral Dynamics]], and [[noosphere]] thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/conscious-evolution-save-humanity-planet/|title=Eco-Futurist Creates Revolutionary 10 Point Plan To Save Humanity &amp; The Planet|date=2015-11-28|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes connected to the theory of the [[global brain]] or [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some have suggested “conscious cultural-evolution”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-04-01|title=Accounting’s contribution to a conscious cultural evolution: an end to sustainable development|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045235403000236|journal=Critical Perspectives on Accounting|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=185–208|doi=10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00023-6|issn=1045-2354}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate term, to reduce association with standard [[Evolution|biological evolution]], though this is not widely applied.

Conscious evolution suggests that now that humanity is conscious of its history and of how things evolve (evolutionary consciousness), and given the rapid pace of change in society and culture, humanity can (and should) choose advancement through co-operation, co-creation and sustainable practices over self-destruction through separateness, competition, and ecological devastation.

== Conscious Evolution - A Mechanism ==

At the centre of the concept of conscious evolution are the approximate definitions of the term’s constituent phenomena ('[[consciousness]]' and '[[evolution]]'). However, the term implies more than these phenomena generally encompass, not least as it is often used with strong assumptions of a collective interest/ common good.

Evolution does not exclusively act upon [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] ([[Phenotype|phenotypic]]) variation; it can also work on a cognitive level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that evolution is simply a process which uses [[natural selection]] as a basic [[algorithm]] for progression.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=0-684-82471-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied to changes in behaviours, practices, concepts, theories and ideas ([[cultural evolution]]). In these situations the mutating [[The Selfish Gene#"Replicators"|replicators]] of evolution can be considered [[Meme|memes]] (theoretical units of cultural information)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The selfish gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[Gene|genes]]. Over the last 10,000 years humanity is increasingly capable of influencing its own environment and cognitively adapting to these environmental changes through the use of evolving [[Meme|memes]]. [[Memetics|Memetic]] (cognitive) innovation (as opposed to morphological variation) has therefore become the primary driver of humanity’s [[Evolution|evolutionary success]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Humans are ‘[[Consciousness|conscious]]’, and are consciously manipulating the [[Meme|memes]] they use. Consciousness itself (in humans’ brains) can therefore be said to have agency over its own evolution, because [[Memetics|memetic]] usage influences evolutionary success. Evolution is also something humans are conscious of. Consciousness (in human brains) can therefore be simultaneously conscious of evolution (working in this case upon [[Meme|memes]]) while consciously manipulating its own [[memetics]], in order to influence its own [[evolution]]. Evolution (in the sense of its impact upon [[memetics]]) is therefore increasingly a subject of knowledge, rather than an unknown pressure operating on the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banathy|first=Bela H.|date=2003-01-16|title=Self-guided/conscious evolution|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sres.506|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–321|doi=10.1002/sres.506|issn=1092-7026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscious Evolution - Writers and Thinkers ==

Conscious evolution is largely the output of several luminaries’ personal evolutionary journeys&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/|title=8/15 – Integral Conscious Evolution - Integral Leadership Review|last=Taborga|first=Jorge|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The central objective is to achieve a globally sustainable future by developing the idea that humans can guide evolution, now that we are conscious of it (evolutionary consciousness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Owing to the broad definition of the term, numerous writers and thinkers, from a range of fields and backgrounds have contributed ideas to the concept of conscious evolution. These include; [[Erich Jantsch]], [[Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Jonas Salk]], [[Ervin Laszlo]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihaly]], [[Bela H. Banathy]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], [[David Bohm#Consciousness and thought|David Bohm]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Duane Elgin]], [[Brian Swimme]], [[Ken Wilber]], [http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/ Jorge Taborga] and others.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase 'conscious evolution' may be that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] in 1918: ''"Conscious evolution means giving less and less place to herd instinct and more to the group imperative. We are emerging from our gregarious condition and are now to enter on the rational way of living by scanning our relations to one another, instead of bluntly feeling them, and so adjusting them that unimpeded progress on this higher plane is secured''.''"'' (''The New State'', p. 91)

Human evolution, has thus far been the consequence of billions of random events and chance interactions (as opposed to a planned endeavour).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolving Self: A Psychology for the New Millenium|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=M.|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans have knowledge of this evolutionary process (evolutionary consciousness) it is the task of humanity to take control of these random changes, to avoid the '[[Extinction|disastrous fate]]' (extinction) that has befallen the majority of species that have ever existed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This idea that evolutionary consciousness should be used as a tool, or even an argument for self-guided evolution, is a major central theme of the concept of conscious evolution. [[Béla H. Bánáthy|Bela H. Banathy]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; captures this sentiment succinctly in his paper ''Self guided/conscious evolution'': ''“Our consciousness of evolution becomes a springboard for leaping into conscious evolution.”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The issue then arises of how humanity can be expected to know how it should use its recently acquired evolutionary consciousness to select the best evolutionary path.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Reality: Merging Intuition and Reason|last=Salk|first=J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk|Jonas Salks]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; is optimistic that humanity is capable of merging intuition with reason in order to find the path that leads to conscious evolution: ''“It now remains for human beings to decide the ultimate course of human evolution. By imagining ourselves inside the process of evolution and by imagining the process of evolution working inside our minds, we may discover how to deal with the opportunities that might influence the direction of evolutionary choices.”''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Tom Atlee|Co-intelligence]]; a form of [[group intelligence]] that incorporates group wisdom for the benefit of humanity, is a concept [[Tom Atlee]] has stressed as an essential foundation for conscious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=2008|title=Co-intelligence, Collective Intelligence, and Conscious Evolution|url=https://co-intelligence.org/AtleeInSteeleCI-Bk.doc|journal=Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace|volume=Earth Intelligence Network|pages=5-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Atlee|Atlee]] suggested that many of the factors of [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] (wisdom, intentionality, choice, awareness) could be used as tools to enhance consciousness and improve shared circumstances. [[Eric Chaisson]] similarly identified ‘knowledge’ and ‘compassion’ as key guiding forces for the future,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Era|last=Chaisson|first=E.|publisher=The Atlantic Monthy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating in 1987 that we must “act wisely, quite beyond intelligently, in order to achieve successful ethical evolution”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson’s]] main emphasis, however, was on [[ethics]], which he argued was the most important focus for ensuring effective conscious evolution: ''“if our species is to survive to enjoy the future, then we must make synonymous the words ‘future’ and ‘ethical,’ thus terming our next evolutionary epoch ‘ethical evolution’”''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Numerous aspects of both [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] and [[ethics]], in our self-guided, conscious evolution are also present in the writings of [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], one of the most widely published advocates of conscious evolution. [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]] has a positive opinion of humanity and the evolutionary process.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conscious Evolution|last=Hubbard|first=B.|publisher=New World Library|year=1996|isbn=|location=Novato, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that: “Every tendency in us leads us toward greater wholeness, unity, and connectedness... Integration is inherent in the process of evolution.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, Hubbard has been criticised for focusing on the most hopeful evidence that conscious evolution is taking humanity in a positive direction.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/hubbard.html|title=Conscious Evolution :: A Book Review by Scott London|last=London|first=Scott|website=www.scottlondon.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott London commented in a review of her 1998 book ''Conscious Evolution; Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential'', that much of the evidence provided was ''“soft data”'', ''“highly questionable”'', or ''“anecdotal”''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite these criticisms [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]], and numerous other advocates of conscious evolution, are continuing to promote the concept, with some suggesting it be included in education and government&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''''D'Alembert’s Dream''''' ( or '''The Dream of D'Alembert''', {{lang-fr|'''Le Rêve de d'Alembert'''}}) is an ensemble of three philosophical dialogues authored by [[Denis Diderot]] in 1769, which first appeared in Grimm's ''Correspondance Littéraire'' in 1782, but was not published in its own right until 1830:

* Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot
* D’Alembert’s Dream
* Continuation of the Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot

In this work, Diderot is at the zenith of his development of [[materialism|materialist]] theories. It is here that he introduces his theory on life and nature, indicating that matter is not fixed but that, on the contrary, subject to [[evolution]]. Each species in existence transforms itself and gives birth to a new species.

He would later create a special version for his patroness, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, replacing the certain character names.

Both [[Julie de Lespinasse]] and [[D’Alembert]] took poorly to being used as protagonists of the conversations.

A '''distinction without a difference''' is a type of [[logical fallacy]] where an author or speaker attempts to describe a distinction between two things where no discernible difference exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophical Writing: An Introduction |author=Martinich, A. P. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pJ2Do2Rg8MC |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is particularly used when a word or phrase has [[connotation]]s associated with it that one party to an argument prefers to avoid.

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

'''Exceptionalism''' is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is "[[wiktionary:exceptional|exceptional]]" (''i.e.'', unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication that the referent is superior in some way, whether specified or not. Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today the term is particularly applied in national or regional contexts. Other uses include medical and genetic exceptionalism. 

==History==
The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the ''Volk'', comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions.  Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a "national spirit", or "soul of the people" (in German: ''Volksgeist'').  This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands—especially in ones ruled by [[élite]]s from somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;Royal J. Schmidt, "Cultural Nationalism in Herder", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (June 1956), pp. 407–17 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707552 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the [[United States]], Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/international-human-rights-australian-exceptionalism|title=Speeches|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Germany, Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/exceptionalism/article2.html|title=Questioning Greek Exceptionalism|first=wehnerj|last=(jwehner@wehnerweb.com)|website=www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Pakistan, [[Imperial Japan]], Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-10-24-south-africa-is-in-africa/#.WMCbezuGPIU|title=South Africa IS in 'Africa' - Daily Maverick|first=Simamkele|last=Dlakavu|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journalismiziko.dut.ac.za/feature-review/south-africas-worrying-exceptionalism/ | title=South Africa's Worrying Exceptionalism | publisher=[[Durban University of Technology]] | work=Iziko Live | date=October 29, 2013 | accessdate=September 2, 2018 | author=Raymond Padya, Journalism Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, Britain, the USSR, the European Union, and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nolte.rewi.hu-berlin.de/doc/pub/European_Exceptionalism.pdf | title=European exceptionalism? | author=[[Georg Nolte]] and Helmut Philipp Aust | journal=Global Constitutionalism | year=2013 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=407 – 436 | doi=10.1017/S2045381713000038| hdl=10419/66220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=du même auteur |url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=EUFOR_359_0083 |title=Becoming Exceptional?

Chase-Dunn, Thomas D. Hall, and E. Susan Manning, "Rise and Fall: East-West Synchronicity and Indic Exceptionalism Reexamined", ''Social Science History'', Volume 24, Number 4, Winter 2000, pp. 727–54 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_science_history/v024/24.4chase-dunn.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to [[historicism]] in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. A group may assert ''exceptionalism'' in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. This can be an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Separateness ==
[[J. Bradford DeLong]] has used the term "exceptionalism" to describe the economic growth of post-[[World War II]] [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLong|first1=J. Bradford|authorlink1=J. Bradford DeLong|title=Post-WWII Western European Exceptionalism: The Economic Dimension|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|publisher=[[University of California]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728125244/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|location=Berkeley|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to [[historicism]] in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. "[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries."{{attribution needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/Matsuda.html |title=ejcjs - Exceptionalism in Political Science: Japanese Politics, US Politics, and Supposed International Norms |publisher=Japanesestudies.org.uk |date= 2003-08-13|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert ''exceptionalism'', with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The term "exceptionalism" can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the [[United States]] government to join various [[international treaties]] is sometimes called "exceptionalist".&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park |first=Jeanne |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2000-11-01/new-sovereigntists-american-exceptionalism-and-its-false-prophets |title=The New Sovereigntists: American Exceptionalism and Its False Prophets |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=November/December 2000 |date= November 2000|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical exceptionalism==
Use of the term "[[HIV exceptionalism]]" implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanssens |first=Catherine ([[Lambda Legal]]) |url=http://www.thebody.com/hanssens/exceptionalism.html |title=Inventing "AIDS Exceptionalism" |publisher=[[TheBody.com]]|date=Winter 1997/1998 |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=New Challenge to Idea That 'AIDS Is Special'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/12/us/new-challenge-to-idea-that-aids-is-special.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|location=[[New York City]]|date=12 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[United States Congress]]|title=Congressional Record, V. 152, Pt. 16, September 29 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwW_dE91hF4C&amp;pg=PA539-IA69|date=25 October 2010|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]]|location=|isbn=978-0-16-086781-1|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic exceptionalism]] is a policy program that [[medicalizes]] genetic information.  Like the exceptionalism surrounding HIV testing, genetic exceptionalism is based on the belief that the average person needs a licensed health professional for guidance and support through the discovery of information with health implications, even if this information is common knowledge, such as that the person has red hair, which is associated with a higher risk of sunburns and skin cancer.  In countries with strong genetic exceptionalism laws, permission from a physician is necessary to obtain information about one's genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

'''''Fides quaerens intellectum''''' means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking intelligence". It is the [[Theology|theological]] method stressed by [[Augustine]] (354–430) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] ({{circa|1033}}&amp;nbsp;– 1109) in which one begins with belief in [[faith]] and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt; Donald K. McKim, Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), 104&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anselm uses this expression for the first time in his [[Proslogion]] (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and [[Reason|human reason]]. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and just later on, when they grow up, they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. But, logically, intellect precedes faith, because we trust other people, at least in principle, only provisionally, but our aim is a direct personal knowledge. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam" ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand").

'''Higher-order volitions''' (or '''higher-order desire'''), as opposed to action-determining volitions, are [[volition (psychology)|volition]]s about volitions. Higher-order volitions are potentially more often guided by long-term [[conviction]]s and [[reason]]ing.

A first-order volition is a desire about anything else, such as to own a new car, to meet the pope, or to drink alcohol.  Second-order volition are desires about desires, or to desire to change the process, the how, of desiring.     Examples would be {{cl-span|to desire to want to own|date=June 2015}} a new car;  meeting the pope; or to desire to quit drinking alcohol permanently. A higher-order volition can go unfulfilled due to uncontrolled lower-order volitions.

An example for a failure to follow higher-order volitions is the drug addict who takes drugs even though he would like to quit taking drugs. According to [[Harry Frankfurt]] the drug addict has established [[free will]], in respect to that single aspect, when his higher-order volition to stop wanting drugs determines the precedence of his changing, action determining desires either to take drugs or not to take drugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13282">[[Ethics]] is the branch of [[philosophy]] that examines right and wrong [[morality|moral]] behavior, moral concepts (such as justice, virtue, duty) and moral language. Various ethical theories pose various answers to the question "What is the greatest good?" and elaborate a complete set of proper behaviors for individuals and groups. Ethical theories are closely related to forms of life in various social orders.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre's Short History of Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alistair|title=A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the 20th Century|year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The epic poems that stand at the beginning of many world literatures, such as the Mesopotamian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], Homer's [[Iliad]] and the Icelandic [[Eddas]], portray a set of values that suit the strong leader of a small tribe. Valour and success are the principal qualities of a hero, and are generally not constrained by moral considerations. Revenge and vendetta are appropriate activities for heroes. The gods that appear in such epics are not defenders of moral values but are capricious forces of nature, and are to be feared and propitiated.&lt;ref&gt;T. Cahill, ''The Gifts of the Jews'' (New York, 1998), ch. 1; A. W. H. Adkins, ''Merit and Responsibility: A Study in Greek Values'' (Oxford, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

More strictly ethical claims are found occasionally in the literature of ancient civilizations that is aimed at lower classes of society. The [[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]] and the Egyptian [[Instruction of Amenhotep]] both advise farmers to leave some grain for poor gleaners, and promise favours from the gods for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' (Chicago, 1963), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ancient religions and ethical thinkers also put forward some version of the [[golden rule]], at least in its negative version: do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wattles, ''The Golden Rule'' (New York, 1996), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish ethics==
{{Further|Jewish ethics|Jewish philosophy}}

Since the origin of [[Ethical Monotheism]] in (Hebrew) Judaism, something Greek-sounding like "ethics" may be said to have been originated in Judaism's up to four thousand years old passed down traditions and instructions of the Torahs (Hebrew: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|ɔː|t|}}, ''toroth''; plural of Torah), [[Oral Torah|Oral]], [[Written Torah|Written]],&lt;ref name="Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630"&gt;Birnbaum (1979), p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalah|Mystical]].

==Ancient Greek ethics==
[[Socrates]], as portrayed in [[Plato]]'s ''Republic'', articulates the greatest good as the transcendent "form of good itself".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; The good, Socrates says, is like the sun. The sun gives light and life to the earth, the good gives knowledge and virtue to the intelligible world.  It is the cause of goodness in people and actions, and it also is the cause of existence and knowledge. The pursuit of and love of the good itself (rather than any particular good thing) Socrates thought was the chief aim of education and (especially) of philosophy.

In his personal life, Socrates lived extremely morally. He was chaste, disciplined, pious, responsible, and cared for his friends&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Symposium, Phaedo, and Republic, Book I&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]] he defends the notion that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it. The Greeks found this paradoxical, but Socrates both argued and lived this philosophy consistently. That is because the doing of evil damages the soul, which is the highest part of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Gorgias'' 475e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic, Socrates is challenged to defend the view that we have reasons to be moral that do not come from rational self-interest, in response to Glaucon's arguments in Book 2. The Republic develops the view that being a good person in an ethical sense involves achieving internal harmony of the parts of the soul. However, Plato's ethical ideal, as expressed in the [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], still has much in common with the Homeric conception of the leader of a tribe or city: the successful running of the city and the internal harmony of the citizen who runs it is the main ethical aim, and there is little mention in Plato of any strictly moral obligations the ruler may be under.

[[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotle's ethics]] builds upon Plato's with important variations. Aristotle's highest good was not the good itself but goodness embodied in a flourishing human life. His ethics are based on ''eudaimonia'', variously translated as "happiness," "prosperity," "flourishing," or "success." A "great-souled" citizen who lives a life of virtue can expect to achieve ''eudaimonia'', which Aristotle argues is the highest good for man. Following Plato, Aristotle gives a significant role in moral life the [[virtues]], fixed habits of behavior that lead to good outcomes; the main virtues are [[courage]], [[justice]], [[prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]. The highest form of life is, however, purely intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Urmson, ''Aristotle's Ethics'' (New York, 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Greek schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], debated the conditions of the good life. Epicurus taught that the greatest good was pleasure and freedom from pain. The Epicureans emphasized the quiet enjoyment of pleasures, especially mental pleasure, free of fear and anxiety. The Stoics thought the greatest good not pleasure but reason and everything in accord with reason, even if painful. Hence they praised the life of reason lived in accordance with nature.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Stephens, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/ Stoic ethics] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of Ancient Greek ethics then is the role of the virtuous life in achieving eudaimonia, or the good life; and Aristotle, Epicurus and the Stoics all argued that virtue was necessary for happiness, albeit in different ways and with different conceptions of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Morality of Happiness''. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
A passage of the [[Torah]], "[[Golden Rule#Judaism|Love your neighbour as yourself]]"&lt;ref name="njps"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=Jewish Publication Society 1917|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the writers of the [[New Testament]] and made part of the theological centerpiece of Christian ethical stance. In the New Testament Jesus teaches that all the commandments of [[Halakha|Jewish religious law]] could be summarized in the two rules, "[[Great Commandment|Love God and love your neighbour]]" (Mark 12:28-31). This is illustrated with the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], which praises action to help any human in need.

==Natural law ethics==
{{Main|Natural law}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a synthesis of Biblical and Aristotelian ethics called [[natural law]] theory, according to which the nature of humans determines what is right and wrong. For example, murder is wrong because life is essential to humans so depriving someone of it is inherently an evil. Education is needed for humans, and is their right, because their intellectual nature requires developing. Natural law theory remains at the heart of Catholic moral teaching, for example in its positions on [[contraception]] and other controversial moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;J. Finnis, ''Fundamentals of Ethics'' (Oxford, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic practice of compulsory [[Confession (religion)|confession]] led to the development of manuals of [[casuistry]], the application of ethical principles to detailed cases of conscience, such as the conditions of a [[just war theory|just war]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Jonsen and S. Toulmin, ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kantian ethics==
{{main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]], in the 18th century, argued that right and wrong are founded on [[duty]], which issues a [[Categorical Imperative]] to us, a command that, of its nature, ought to be obeyed. An action is only truly moral if done from a sense of duty, and the most valuable thing is a human will that has decided to act rightly. To decide what duty requires, Kant proposes the principle of [[universalizability]]: correct moral rules are those everyone could adopt.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnson, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/ Kant's moral philosophy] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's philosophy marks a number of important conceptual shifts in philosophical thinking about ethics. Kant argues that questions about happiness should not be a focus in ethical thought, because ethics should be universal while happiness may involve very different modes of life for different individuals. He also believed this approach was necessary if an ethical theory was to avoid becoming 'heteronomous'; that is, locating the source of proper moral motivation outside of properly moral concerns.

==Utilitarianism==
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
In 19th century Britain, [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated [[utilitarianism]], the view that right actions are those that are likely to result in the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Utilitarianism remains popular in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. P. Singer, ''Practical Ethics'' (2nd ed, Cambridge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism provide ethical theories that can support contemporary liberal political developments, and associated enlightenment ways of conceiving of the individual.

==Twentieth century==
The early twentieth century saw many debates on [[metaethics]], that is, philosophical theory on the nature of ethics. Views ranged from [[moral realism]], which holds that moral truths are about mind-independent realities,&lt;ref&gt;R. Shafer-Landau, ''Moral Realism: A Defence'' (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[evolutionary ethics]], which believes ethical practices are merely evolved ways of behavior that led to evolutionary success, to the [[error theory]] of [[J. L. Mackie]], which held that the entire notion of ethical obligation is a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mackie, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (New York, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflections on the [[Holocaust]], such as those of [[Hannah Arendt]], led to a deepening appreciation of the reality of extreme evil. Also in reaction to the Holocaust, [[rights]] theories, as expressed for example in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], asserted the inalienable moral rights of humans to life, education, and other basic goods. Another response to the atrocities of World War II included existential reflections on the meaning of life, leading to approaches to ethics based on "the situation" and personal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Ethics of Ambiguity''. Citadel, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw the revival of casuistry in the form of [[applied ethics]], the consideration of detailed practical cases in [[bioethics]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Martensen, The history of bioethics: an essay review, ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' 56 (2001), 168-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[business ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;T.F. McMahon, A brief history of American business ethics, in R. Frederick, ed, ''A Companion to Business Ethics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2002, pp. 342-52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[environmental ethics]] and other such special fields. The development of new medical technologies such as [[IVF]] and [[stem cell controversy|stem cell]] research produced many new issues requiring ethical debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18737">{{main|Creativity}}
The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''immaculate perception''' has been used in various senses by various philosophers.

* It is a [[nickname]] for [[Plato]]'s theory of knowledge.  It is called this because Plato believed that all knowledge came from past lives, and from one's knowledge of [[The Forms]].
* It was used by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], who referred to it as the necessity of "keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving the images simply as they are."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. (1620). The Great Instauration.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was used by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his text ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.  Nietzsche argued that this kind of perception mere fiction, for it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world.  In particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Michael. ''A Dancer’s Virtue: Human Life in Light of Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence''. Concept XXVIII, 2005. [http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Dancer's%20Virtue.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper 8Ball released a song in March 2012 titled "immaculate perception" featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Yelawolf.

For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

The '''internal measurement''' is one of the measurement theories. From,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kouichirou Matsuno
|year=2000
|title=What is Internal Measurement? (in Japanese)
|publisher=Seidosha
|location=Japan
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; we introduce the definition of the internal measurement. 
The experience consists of "unremitting measurements". These "unremitting measurements" appear only in the experience. In the experience, if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a "measurement which identifies another individual", where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual. Moreover, a "measurement which identifies another individual" is unremitting in the experience. As above a measurement such that if any individual measure another individual then this measurement inherent in "unremitting measurements" is called the internal measurement. This theory is found by Kouichirou Matsuno and 
is developed by [[Yukio-Pegio Gunji]].  

There is a likeness between internal measurement and [[endophysics]]. 
However, they have slight difference, that is, internal measurement have before-after logical asymmetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Ironist''' (n. Ironism) (from Greek: ''eiron'', ''eironeia''), a term coined by [[Richard Rorty]], describes someone who fulfills three conditions:

{{Quotation|
# She has radical and continuing doubts about the [[final vocabulary]] she currently uses, because she has been impressed by other vocabularies, vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered; 
# She realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts; 
# Insofar as she philosophizes about her situation, she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others, that it is in touch with a power not herself. |Richard Rorty|Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p.73}}

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', Rorty argues that [[Proust]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Heidegger]], [[Derrida]], and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Nabokov]], among others, all exemplify Ironism to different extents.

The principle of '''Irreducibility''', in [[philosophy]], has the sense that a complete account of an [[entity]] will not be possible at lower levels of [[explanation]] and which has novel properties beyond prediction and explanation. Another way to state this is that [[Occam's razor]] requires the elimination of only those entities that are unnecessary, not as many entities as could conceivably be eliminated. [[Lev Vygotsky]] provides the following illustration of the idea, in his ''Thought and Language'':

:"Two essentially different modes of analysis are possible in the study of [[psychology|psychological]] structures. It seems to us that one of them is responsible for all the failures that have beset former investigators of the old problem, which we are about to tackle in our turn, and that the other is the only correct way to approach it.

:The first method analyzes complex psychological wholes into "[[wiktionary:element|elements]]". It may be compared to the [[chemical analysis]] of water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], neither of which possesses the properties of the whole and each of which possesses properties not present in the whole. The student applying this method in looking for an explanation of some property of water &amp;mdash; why it extinguishes fire, for example &amp;mdash; will find to his surprise that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire ....

:In our opinion the right course to follow is to use the other type of analysis, which may be called "analysis into units". By "unit", we mean a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole, and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Not the chemical composition of water, but its molecules and their behaviour, are the key to the understanding of the properties of water ..."

In other words: to conserve the properties under investigation, it is necessary to remain within a certain level of complexity. Irreducibility is most often deployed in defence of the reality of human [[subjectivity]] and/or [[free will]], against those who treat such things as [[folk psychology]], such as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].

In “Life's Irreducible Structure”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/polanyi/Polanyi_Life_Structures.pdf|title=Life's Irreducible Structure|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1968|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michael Polanyi|Micheal Polanyi]] argues that higher-order sciences such as biology and other chemical processes can not be explained by the fundamentalist perspective.  Indeed, machines and the humans that make them fall into "boundary conditions" that produce phenomena that itself can not be reduced further. He writes &lt;blockquote&gt;The lowest level is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of words; the third, the joining of words that make sentences; the fourth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and the highest, the composition of the text. The principles of each level operate under the control of the next-higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with a grammar; and the sentences are fitted into a style, which in turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition. Thus each level is subject to dual control: (i) control in accordance with the laws that apply to its elements in themselves, and (ii) control in accordance with the laws of the powers that control the comprehensive entity formed by these elements&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is worth noting that Reductionism has not been ruled out as an explanation of these tipping-point, emergent behaviors.

'''Jesuitism''' is a [[casuistic]] approach to moral questions and problems, so called because it was promoted by some [[Jesuits]] of the 17th century. The earliest known citation is 1622.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Some Jesuit theologians,{{who|date=November 2018}} in view of promoting personal responsibility and the respect of [[freedom of conscience]], stressed the importance of the 'case by case' approach to personal moral decisions and ultimately developed and accepted a [[casuistry]] (the study of ''cases of consciences'') where at the time of decision, individual inclinations were more important than the moral law itself.  A British encyclopedia of 1900 claimed that it was "popularly regarded as an attempt to achieve holy ends by unholy means."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/j/jesuitism.html Nuttall Encyclopædia of General Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]], the French [[mathematician]], religious philosopher and [[Jansenist]] sympathiser, vigorously attacked the moral [[laxism]] of such Jesuits in his famous ''[[Lettres provinciales]]'' of 1656-57.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It is considered suspect by many moral theologians.{{who|date=November 2018}}

'''Julio Cabrera''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] living in [[Brazil]]. He is a retired professor of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Brasília and former head of the department. Previously he taught in Argentina, at the National University of Córdoba, the University of Belgrano and then in Brazil at the Federal University of Santa Maria. Currently, he is a senior associate researcher, by invitation, in the Bioethics Doctoral Program of the University of Brasília. He is best known for his works on "negative ethics" and cinema and philosophy. Other areas of philosophy that he deals with are philosophy of language, logic and Latin American philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/fundacionjaimeroca/docs/juliocabrera] ''Entrevista al Dr. Julio Cabrera'', Serie Entrevistas, Fundación Dr. Jaime Roca, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4175] ''Sem grandes intuiçoes, nao há grande filosofia'', Instituto Humanitas Unisinos, number 379, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/preview.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=K4781131E6] Biogram on Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-i-am.html] J. Cabrera, ''Who I am''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative ethics ==

In his book ''A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Políticas negativas y ética de la libertación. ¿Es posible ser um pessimista revolucionário? (Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Projeto de Ética Negativa'', São Paulo: Mandacaru, 1989 (second edition: ''A Ética e Suas Negações, Não nascer, suicídio e pequenos assassinatos'', Rio De Janeiro: Rocco, 2011). [https://misantropiaemelancolia.wordpress.com/2017/10/24/project-of-negative-ethics/] English translation of the first chapter of ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Ética Negativa: problemas e discussoes''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera (ed.), ''Ética Negativa: problemas e discussoes'', Goiânia: UFG, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Porque te amo, não nascerás! Nascituri te salutant''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J. Cabrera, T. Lenharo di Santis, ''Porque te amo, não nascerás!

Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situação humana, ética e procriação responsável'', Brasília: UnB, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia'', São Paulo: Nankin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (a sort of second volume of ''Cine: 100 anos de filosofia'') and  ''Diálogo/cinema''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J. Cabrera, ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch'', Enl@ce, year 6, number 2, Maracaibo: Universidad del Zulia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)''&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Margens das filosofias da linguagem: conflitos e aproximações entre analíticas, hermenêuticas, fenomenologias e metacríticas da linguagem'', Brasília: UnB, 2003 (reprinted in 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

Cabrera, ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Unijuí: Unijuí, 2010. (second edition in 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14199">{{distinguish|Moore's law|paradox of analysis}}
'''Moore's paradox''' concerns the apparent absurdity involved in asserting a first-person present-tense sentence such as, "It's raining, but I don't believe that it is raining" or "It's raining but I believe that it is not raining." The first author to note this apparent absurdity was [[G. E. Moore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |chapter=Moore's Paradox |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Baldwin |title=G. E. Moore: Selected Writings |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |pages=207–212 |isbn=978-0-415-09853-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 'Moorean' sentences, as they have become known, are paradoxical in that while they appear absurd, they nevertheless:
# Can be true,
# Are (logically) consistent, and moreover
# Are not (obviously) [[contradiction]]s.
The term 'Moore's paradox' is attributed to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Philosophical Investigations |location= |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1953 |others=Section II.x |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who considered the paradox Moore's most important contribution to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Letters to Russell, Keynes and Moore |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=von Wright |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote about the paradox extensively in his later writings, which brought Moore's paradox the attention it would not have otherwise received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volume I |editor1-first=G. E. M. |editor1-last=Anscombe |editor2-first=G. H. |editor2-last=von Wright |others=Translated by G. E. M. Anscombe |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-631-12541-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's paradox has also been connected to many other of the well-known [[paradox#Logical paradox|logical paradoxes]] including, though not limited to, the [[liar paradox]], the [[knower paradox]], the [[unexpected hanging paradox]], and the [[preface paradox]].&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roy A. |last=Sorensen |year=1988 |title=Blindspots |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824981-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no generally accepted explanation of Moore's paradox in the philosophical literature. However, while Moore's paradox remains a philosophical curiosity, Moorean-type sentences are used by logicians, computer scientists, and those working in the [[artificial intelligence]] community as examples of cases in which a knowledge, belief, or information system is unsuccessful in updating its knowledge/belief/information store in light of new or novel information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendricks | first=Vincent F. | last2=Symons | first2=John | title=Where's the Bridge? Epistemology and Epistemic Logic | journal=Philosophical Studies | volume=128 | issue=1 | year=2006 | issn=0031-8116 | doi=10.1007/s11098-005-4060-0 | pages=137–167| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.3026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
Since [[Jaakko Hintikka]]'s seminal treatment of the problem,&lt;ref name="Hintikka"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jaakko |last=Hintikka |year=1962 |title=Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the Two Notions |location=Cornell, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become standard to present Moore's paradox by explaining why it is absurd to assert sentences that have the logical form:
"P and NOT(I believe that P)" or "P and I believe that NOT-P."
Philosophers nowadays refer to these, respectively, as the omissive and commissive versions of Moore's paradox.

Moore himself presented the problem in two ways.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |year=1991 |chapter=Russell's Theory of Descriptions |editor-first=P. A. |editor-last=Schilpp |title=The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell |series=The Library of Living Philosophers |volume=5 |location=La Salle, IL |publisher=Open Court Publishing |pages=177–225 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first more fundamental way of setting the problem up starts from the following three premises:
# It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
# I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
# It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

I can assert that it is raining at a particular time. I can assert that I don't believe that it is raining at a particular time. If I say both at the same time, I am saying or doing something absurd. But the content of what I say—the [[proposition]] the sentence expresses—is perfectly consistent: it may well be raining, and I may not believe it. So why cannot I assert that it is so?

Moore presents the problem in a second, distinct, way:
# It is not absurd to assert the past-tense counterpart, e.g. "It was raining, but I did not believe that it was raining."
# It is not absurd to assert the second- or third-person counterparts to Moore's sentences, e.g. "It is raining, but ''you'' do not believe that it is raining," or "Michael is dead, but ''they'' do not believe that he is."
# It is absurd to assert the present-tense "It is raining and I don't believe that it is raining."

I can assert that I ''was'' a certain way, e.g. believing it was raining when it wasn't, and that you, he, or they, ''are'' that way but not that I ''am'' that way.

Subsequent philosophers have further noted that there is also an apparent absurdity in asserting a first-person ''future-tense'' sentence such as "It will be raining, and I will believe that it is not raining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Luc |last=Bovens |year=1995 |title='P and I Will Believe that not-P': Diachronic Constraints on Rational Belief |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=104 |issue=416 |pages=737–760 |doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when it does not specify an exact time for when the belief is mistaken, the proposition will tend to be true at some point in the future - its negation would imply that "Every time I believe it's not raining, it will not be raining", which is unlikely since human beliefs are often mistaken.

Many philosophers—though by no means all—also hold that Moore's paradox arises not only at the level of [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|assertion]] but also at the level of [[belief]]. One who believes an instance of a Moorean sentence is tantamount to one who is subject to or engaging in [[self-deception]], at least on one standard way of describing it.

==Proposed explanations==
Philosophical interest in Moore's paradox, since Moore and Wittgenstein, has undergone a resurgence, starting with, though not limited to, [[Jaakko Hintikka]],&lt;ref name="Hintikka" /&gt; continuing with [[Roy Sorensen]],&lt;ref name="Sorensen"/&gt; [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=David |last=Rosenthal |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Consciousness |series=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=9 |title=AI, Connectionism and Philosophical Psychology |year=1995 |location=Atascadero, CA |publisher=Ridgeview |isbn=978-0-924922-73-2 |pages=313–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Shoemaker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sydney |last=Shoemaker |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Self-Knowledge |title=The First-Person Perspective and other essays |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-56871-5 |pages=74–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first publication, in 2007, of a collection of articles devoted to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Mitchell S. |editor1-last=Green |editor2-first=John N. |editor2-last=Williams |title=Moore's Paradox: New Essays on Belief, Rationality and the First-Person |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-928279-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several proposed constraints on a satisfactory explanation in the literature, including (though not limited to):
*It should explain the absurdity of both the omissive and the commissive versions.
*It should explain the absurdity of both asserting and believing Moore's sentences.
*It should preserve, and reveal the roots of, the intuition that contradiction (or something contradiction-like) is at the root of the absurdity.

The first two conditions have generally been the most challenged, while the third appears to be the ''least'' controversial. Some philosophers have claimed that there is, in fact, no problem in believing the content of Moore's sentences (e.g. David Rosenthal).  Others (e.g. Sydney Shoemaker) hold that an explanation of the problem at the level of belief will automatically provide us with an explanation of the absurdity at the level of assertion via the linking principle that what can reasonably be asserted is determined by what can reasonably be believed. Some have also denied (e.g. Rosenthal) that a satisfactory explanation to the problem need be uniform in explaining both the omissive AND commissive versions. Most of the explanations offered of Moore's paradox are united in holding that [[contradiction]] is at the heart of the absurdity.

One type of explanation at the level of assertion exploits the view that assertion implies or expresses [[belief]] in some way so that if someone asserts that ''p'' they imply or express the belief that ''p''. Several versions of this view exploit elements of [[speech act]] theory, which can be distinguished according to the particular explanation given of the link between assertion and belief. Whatever version of this view is preferred, whether cast in terms of the Gricean intentions (see [[Paul Grice]]) or in terms of the structure of Searlean illocutionary acts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Searle |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Daniel |last2=Vanderveken |title=Foundations of Illocutionary Logic |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-521-26324-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[speech act]]), it does not obviously apply to explaining the absurdity of the commissive version of Moore's paradox. To take one version of this type of explanation, if someone asserts ''p'' and conjoins it with the assertion (or denial) that he does not believe that ''p'', then he has in that very act contradicted himself, for in effect what the speaker says is: I believe that ''p'' and I do not believe that ''p''. The absurdity of asserting '''p'' &amp; I do not believe that ''p''' is thus revealed as being of a more familiar kind. Depending on one's view of the nature of contradiction, one might thus interpret a speaker of the omissive Moorean sentence as asserting everything (that is, asserting ''too'' much) or asserting nothing (that is, not asserting ''enough'').

An alternative view is that the assertion "I believe that ''p''" often (though '''not''' always) functions as an alternative way of asserting "''p''", so that the semantic content of the assertion "I believe that ''p''" is just ''p'': it functions as a statement about the world and not about anyone's state of mind. Accordingly, what someone asserts when they assert "''p'' and I believe that not-''p''" is just "''p'' and not-''p''" Asserting the commissive version of Moore's sentences is again assimilated to the more familiar (putative) impropriety of asserting a [[contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Kent |last=Linville |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Merrill |last2=Ring |title=Moore's Paradox Revisited |journal=Synthese |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=295–309 |doi=10.1007/BF00485405 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of belief, there are two main kinds of explanation. The first, much more popular one, agrees with those at the level of assertion that contradiction is at the heart of the absurdity. The contradiction is revealed in various ways, some using the resources of [[doxastic logic]] (e.g. Hintikka), others (e.g. Sorensen) principles of [[rational belief]] maintenance and formation, while still others appeal to our putative capacity for [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and the [[first-person authority]] (e.g. Shoemaker) we have over our states of mind.

Another alternative view, due to [[Richard Moran (philosopher)|Richard Moran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Moran |title=Authority &amp; Estrangement: An Essay on Self-knowledge |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-691-08944-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; views the existence of Moore's paradox as symptomatic of creatures who are capable of self-knowledge, capable of thinking ''for'' themselves from a deliberative point of view, as well as ''about'' themselves from a theoretical point of view. On this view, anyone who asserted or believed one of Moore's sentences would be subject to a loss of self-knowledge—in particular, would be one who, with respect to a particular 'object', broadly construed, e.g. person, apple, the way of the world, would be in a situation which violates, what Moran calls, the Transparency Condition: if I want to know what I think about X, then I consider/think about nothing but X itself. Moran's view seems to be that what makes Moore's paradox so distinctive is not some contradictory-like phenomenon (or at least not in the sense that most commentators on the problem have construed it), whether it be located at the level of belief or that of assertion. Rather, that the very possibility of Moore's paradox is a consequence of our status as agents (albeit finite and resource-limited ones) who are capable of knowing (and changing) their own minds.

'''Neo-Aristotelianism''' is a view of [[literature]] and [[rhetorical criticism]] propagated by the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]]&lt;ref&gt;James P. Beasley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ocq0I7PbxiAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Prehistory of Rhetoric and Composition: New Rhetoric and Neo-Aristotelianism at the University of Chicago, 1947--1959]'', ProQuest, 2007, pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others &amp;mdash; which means.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Neo-Aristotelianism.html
Definition from The University of Toronto National Library&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central features were first suggested in [[Herbert Wichelns|Herbert A. Wichelns]]' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Herbert A.|last=Wichelns|author-link=Herbert Wichelns|editor-last=Drummond|editor-first=Alexander M.|title=The Literary Criticism of Oratory|encyclopedia=Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brigance|first=William Norwood|title=A History and Criticism of American Public Address|year=1943|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss.|first=Sonja K|title=. Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Aristotelianism "led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Literary Criticism of Oratory"==&lt;!-- The article Herbert Wichelns links here --&gt;
Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:
* Speaker's personality 
* Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) 
* [[Audience]] 
* Major ideas 
* Motives to which the speaker appealed 
* Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) 
* Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience 
* Arrangement 
* [[Stylistics (field of study)|Mode of expression]] 
* Speech preparation 
* Delivery 
* Effect of the [[discourse]] on the immediate audience and long-term effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichelns|first=Herbert A.|title="The Literary Criticisms of Oratory," in Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" provided "substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyn|first=Mark S.|title="Toward a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism," in Essays on Rhetorical Criticism|year=1968|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Donald C.|title=The Rhetorical Idiom: Essays in Rhetoric, Oratory, Language, and Drama|year=1958|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LargeTribarGotschuchenAustria.JPG|thumb|This apparently impossible object, located in Gotschuchen,  Austria, projects into a [[Penrose triangle]]]]

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Overview==

===Antecedents===
Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato. [...] What Plato represented as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry is resuscitated in the "two cultures" quarrel of more recent times between the humanities and the sciences.|title-link=The Educated Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 245a, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 209a, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 398a, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' 817 b-d and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, T. J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical Sociological Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 |year=2002|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9437">[[File:John Dewey in 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Pragmatic ethics was discussed by [[John Dewey]] (pictured)]] '''Pragmatic ethics''' is a theory of [[normative ethics|normative]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[ethics]]. Ethical pragmatists such as [[John Dewey]] believe that some societies have progressed [[morality|morally]] in much the way they have attained progress in [[science]]. Scientists can pursue [[inquiry]] into the [[truth]] of a [[hypothesis]] and [[belief|accept]] the hypothesis, in the sense that they act as though the hypothesis were true; nonetheless, they think that future generations can advance science, and thus future generations can refine or replace (at least some of) their accepted hypotheses. Similarly, ethical pragmatists think that norms, principles, and moral criteria are likely to be improved as a result of [[inquiry]].

==Contrast with other normative theories&lt;!--'Peircean realism' redirects here--&gt;==
Much as it is appropriate for scientists to act as though a hypothesis were true despite expecting future inquiry to supplant it, ethical pragmatists acknowledge that it can be appropriate to practice a variety of other normative approaches (e.g. [[consequentialism]], [[deontological ethics]], and [[virtue ethics]]), yet acknowledge the need for mechanisms which allow society to advance beyond such approaches, a freedom for discourse which does not take any such theory as assumed.&lt;ref name=Liszka&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2005/Liszka.htm |title= What Is Pragmatic Ethics? |first= James |last= Liszka | accessdate= 2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aimed at [[social innovation]], the ''practice'' of pragmatic ethics supplements the practice of other normative approaches with what [[John Stuart Mill]] called "experiments of living".&lt;ref name=Mill1863&gt;{{harvtxt|Mill|1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatic ethics also differs from other normative approaches ''theoretically'', according to {{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}:&lt;ref name="Lafollette2000"/&gt;

# It focuses on society, rather than on lone individuals, as the entity which achieves morality.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000&gt;{{harvtxt|Lafollette|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dewey's words, "all conduct is ... social." &lt;ref name=Dewey1922&gt;{{harvtxt| Dewey|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It does not hold any known moral criteria as beyond potential for revision.&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; Pragmatic ethics may be misunderstood as [[Moral relativism|relativist]], as failing to be objective, but that is like suggesting that science fails to be objective. Ethical pragmatists, like scientists, can maintain that their endeavor is objective on the grounds that it converges towards something objective (a thesis called '''Peircean realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Almeder1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Almeder |first= R. |year=1983 |title= Scientific Progress and Peircean Utopian Realism |journal= Erkenntnis |issue= 20 |pages= 253–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It allows that a moral judgment may be appropriate in one age of a given society, even though it will cease to be appropriate after that society progresses (or may already be inappropriate in another society).&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; For example, the writings of [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|on slavery]] framed slavery as ultimately immoral, yet temporarily moral until America was ready for abolition.&lt;ref name="HEI"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bateman | first = Newton |author2=Paul Selby |author3=Frances M. Shonkwiler |author4=Henry L Fowkes  | title = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois | publisher = Munsell Publishing Company | year = 1908 | location = Chicago, IL | page = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to pragmatism==
Establishing that this normative theory entails [[pragmatism]] (or vice versa) remains an open challenge. The ''Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory'' refers to this theory as pragmatic and finds it in the writings of [[John Dewey]] (a pragmatist). However, it also finds key concepts in the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]],&lt;ref name=Lafollette2000/&gt; and we can see at least some of its distinguishing characteristics in the concept of [[social gadfly]] attributed to [[Socrates]] in [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.Apol.30e&amp;lang=original | title = Apology 30e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Pragmatic ethics has been criticized as conflating [[descriptive ethics]]  with [[normative ethics]], as describing the way people ''do'' make moral judgments rather than the way they ''should'' make them. While some ethical pragmatists may have questioned the distinction between normative and descriptive truth, the theory of pragmatic ethics itself does not conflate them any more than science conflates truth about its subject matter with current opinion about it.&lt;ref name=Liszka/&gt;

==Moral ecology==
Moral ecology is a variation of pragmatic ethics which additionally supposes that morality evolves like an [[ecosystem]], and ethical practice should therefore include strategies analogous to those of [[ecosystem management]] (e.g. protecting a degree of moral diversity). The term "moral ecology" has been used since at least 1985 to imply a [[symbiosis]] whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches.&lt;ref name=Bellah1985&gt;{{harvtxt|Bellah|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Hertzke1998&gt;{{harvtxt| Hertzke |1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Dean, current scientific evidence confirms that humans do take diverse approaches to morality, and such [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] gives humanity [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] against a wider range of situations and environments (which makes moral diversity a natural consequence of [[frequency-dependent selection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:12763/SOURCE02?view=true |last1 = Dean | first1 = Tim |title= Evolution &amp; Moral Ecology | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15557">'''Praxeology''' or '''praxiology''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɹ|æ|k|s|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; {{etymology|grc|''πρᾶξις'' (praxis)|deed, action||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the study of human [[Action (philosophy)|action]], based on the notion that humans engage in purposeful behavior, as opposed to [[Reflex|reflexive behavior]] like sneezing and unintentional behavior.

French social philosopher [[Alfred Espinas]] gave the term its modern meaning, and its study was developed independently by two principal groups: the [[Austrian school]] created by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and the Polish school created by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ryan |editor1-first=Leo V. |editor2-last=Nahser |editor2-first=F. Byron |editor3-last=Gasparski |editor3-first=Wojciech |date=2002 |title=Praxiology and pragmatism |series=Praxiology: the international annual of practical philosophy and methodology |volume=10 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |pages=7–9 |isbn=0765801671 |oclc=49617735 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
Coinage of the word ''praxeology'' is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his ''Théorie des sciences: Plan de Science intégrale'' in 1882:

{{quote|On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from πραξις, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, [[Mesology]] (from μεσος, environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdeau|first=Louis|title=Théorie des sciences: Plan de Science intégrale|volume=Tome Second|publisher=Librarie Germer Baillière|location=Paris|date=1882|quote=À raison de leur double caractère de spécialité et de généralité, les fonctions doivent constituer l'objet d'une science distincte. Quelques—unes de ses parties ont été étudiées de bonne heure, car ce genre de recherches, dont l'homme pouvait se faire le sujet principal, a présenté de tout temps le plus vif intérêt. La physiologie, l'hygiène, la médecine, la psychologie, l'histoire des animaux, l'histoire humaine, l'économie politique, la morale, etc., représentent des fragments de la science que nous voudrions établir; mais fragments, épars et sans coordination, sont restés a l'état de sciences particulières. Il faudrait les rapprocher et en faire un tout afin de mettre en lumière l'ordre de l'ensemble et son unité. On aurait alors une… science, innommée jusqu'ici et que nous proposons d'appeler Praxéologie (de πραξις, action), ou, en se référant a l'influence des milieu, Mésologie (de μεơος, milieu).|page=463|url=http://iris.univ-lille1.fr/handle/1908/3842|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by [[Clemens Timpler]] in his ''Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum'':

{{quote|There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timpler|first=Clemens|title=Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum|volume=libris IV pertractatam|location=Hanoviae|publisher=Apud Gulielmum Antonio|date=1608|page=388|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_IaPUCZDkdQYC#page/n418/mode/1up|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}|quote=Fuit Aretologia: Sequitur Praxiologia: quæ est altera pars Ethicæ, tractans generaliter de actionibus moralibus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later mentioned by [[Robert Flint]] in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's ''Théorie des sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Flint|title=Philosophy as Scientia Scientiarum|location=Edinburgh|date=1904|pages=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition of the word was first given by [[Alfred Espinas|Alfred V. Espinas]] (1844–1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Jean J.|title=Notes biographiques et bibliographiques sur Alfred Espinas|journal=Review Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|number=3|date=July–September 1967|pages=385–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of [[Efficiency|efficient]] action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] (in 1911), and proposed by [[Knight Dunlap]] to [[John B. Watson]] as a better name for his [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John B.|title=Behaviourism: The Early Years|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, [[Zing-Yang Kuo]] (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Murchison, Carl Allanmore, ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'', Volumes 3–4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} It was also used by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (in 1928 and later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=McDougall|title=The Battle of Behaviorism: An Exposition and an Exposure|date=1928|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Previously the word ''praxiology'', with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, [[Eugene Slutsky]] (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by [[Austrian economics|Austrian economist]] Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (1888–1938) during the [[Second International]] Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar [[Oskar R. Lange|Oscar Lange]] (1904–1965) in 1959, and later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, ''prassiologia'', in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the [[Second World War]] the use of the term ''praxeology'' spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil [[Murray Rothbard]] defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of [[Pierre Massé]] (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges Théodule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, [[Leo Apostel]] (1957), the cybernetician, [[Anatol Rapoport]] (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), [[François Perroux]], economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, [[Raymond Aron]] (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Under the influence of [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], praxeology flourished in Poland. A special "Centre of Praxeology" (''Zaklad Prakseologiczny'') was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first ''Materiały Prakseologiczne'' (''Praxeological Papers''), and then abbreviated to ''Prakseologia''. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French [[statistician]] Micheline Petruszewycz, "A propos de la praxéologie".&lt;ref&gt;In 'Mathématiques et Sciences Humaines', Paris, Centre de mathématique sociale et de statistique-Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, No. 11. Ete, 1965, pp. 11–18, and a rejoinder 'Réponse a un appel' by J. Ostrowski, ''ibid'',, No. 19, Ete, 1967, pp. 21–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including [[Immanuel Kant]]'s works, [[Max Weber]]'s work on [[methodological individualism]], and [[Carl Menger]]'s development of the [[subjective theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selgin|first=George A.|title=Praxeology and Understanding: An Analysis of the Controversy in Austrian Economics|url=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-and-understanding-analysis-controversy-austrian-economics-0|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|volume=2|date=1987|page=22|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austrian economics==
{{Austrian School sidebar |expanded=Theory}}
[[Austrian economics]] relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories.&lt;ref name="rothmeth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|chapter=Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics|title=The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics|date=1976|pages=19–39|chapterurl=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the [[action axiom]] as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. "Praxeology, value judgments, and public policy." ''The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics'' (1976): 89–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, [[Murray Rothbard]] divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual ([[Robinson Crusoe Economy|Crusoe Economics]])
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange ([[Catallactics]], or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. [[Barter]]
:: 2. With [[Money|Medium of Exchange]]
::: a. On the [[Free Market|Unhampered Market]]
::: b. Effects of [[government|Violent Intervention]] with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of [[War]] – Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (e.g., [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]])
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard. [https://www.mises.org/library/praxeology-reply-mr-schuller "Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller"], ''[[American Economic Review]]'', December 1951, pp. 943–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
[[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has argued that, because praxeology rejects [[positivism]] and [[empiricism]] in the development of [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]], it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the [[Scientific method#Characterizations|scientific method]]. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the [[Austrian school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Mayer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response |publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Review |date=Winter 1998 |pages=151–71 |ref=harv|doi=10.1080/08913819808443491|volume=12 |quote=}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton1999"&gt;"Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794–96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ludwig von|last=Mises|title=Epistemological Problems of Economics|edition=3rd|date=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|translator-last=Reisman|translator-first=George|url=https://mises.org/library/epistemological-problems-economics|accessdate={{date|2017-02|04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothmeth" /&gt; Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and "unrepeatable," whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.&lt;ref name="MisesHumanAction"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/09/12/antony-davies/complementary-approaches|title=Complementary Approaches|first=Antony|last=Davies|date={{date|2012-09-12}}|website=Cato Unbound|access-date={{date|2016-12-27}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predeterminism is closely related to [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=ONeill1981&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

==Definitional difficulties==
Predeterminism is difficult to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead to a variety of similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in [[metaphysics]], [[theology]], and the philosophy of [[free will]]. The term ''predeterminism'' suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term [[predetermination]] are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the [[Physicalism|physicalist]] (and often scientific) notion of ''[[causal determinism]]'' to even the theological (and often religious) notion of ''[[predestination]]''.

A [[secular]] example to try to illustrate predeterminism is that a fetus's future physical, emotional, and other personal characteristics as a matured human being may be considered "predetermined" by heredity, [[i.e.]] derived from a chain of events going back long before her eventual birth. However, one of the difficulties with defining predeterminism using this example is that the word ''predetermine'' necessarily implies a conscious being "doing" the determining ahead of time. With regards to predetermined heredity, a conscious being (perhaps a genetic scientist) is presumed to be the one speculating on what the fetus's personal characteristics will turn out to be, for example, based on looking at the genomes of the fetus and its ancestors. If there were not this conscious entity, the scientist, then one could say merely that the fetus's characteristics are ''determined'' by heredity, rather than ''pre''determined. Predeterminism necessarily implies, at the very least, a passive but all-knowing observer, if not an active planner, designer, or manipulator (of the fetus's personal characteristics). This basic scientific idea of hereditary determination, though, already fulfills the definition of [[causal determinism]], a metaphysical concept.

While determinism usually refers to a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events ''before'' they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to a belief in the existence of a conscious being who must determine ''all'' actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming [[omnipotence]], almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably [[supernatural]] and [[omniscient]]. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: [[predestination]]. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in advance, fixed all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinist]]s in [[Christian]] theology.

Likewise, the doctrine of [[fatalism]] already explicitly attributes all events and outcomes to the will of a (vaguer) higher power such as fate or destiny. Furthermore, in philosophic debates about the compatibility of [[free will]] and [[determinism]], some argue that ''predeterminism'' back to the origin of the universe is simply what philosophers mean by the more common term "determinism." Others have suggested that the term "[[self-determination]]" be used to describe actions as merely "determined" by an agent's reasons, motives, and desires.

When various interpretation of the word ''predeterminism'' can be defined even better by other terms, such as the aforementioned determinism, predestination, or fatalism, then the definition of predeterminism itself appears awkward, unclear, and perhaps even worthless in terms of practical or philosophic discussion.

==R. E. Hobart==

R. E. Hobart is the pseudonym of [[Dickinson S. Miller]], a student of [[William James]] who was later one of James' closest personal friends and for some years a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department. Hobart (Miller) criticized the core idea of James' ''The Will to Believe'', namely that it was acceptable to hold religious faith in the absence of evidence for or against that faith. James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy."

Nearly 25 years after James' death, R. E. Hobart published a short article in ''Mind'' in 1934 that is considered one of the definitive statements of [[determinism]] and [[compatibilism]]. It was entitled ''Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It''.&lt;ref name="Hobart"&gt;R. E. Hobart "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart's compatibilism was similar to earlier landmark positions by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]], as refined in the 19th-century compatibilist views of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], and [[F. H. Bradley]]. But unlike them Hobart explicitly did not endorse ''strict'' logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly did endorse the existence of [http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html alternative possibilities], which can depend on absolute [[Randomness|chance]].

He was writing just a few years after the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Indeterminacy principle|indeterminacy]], and also makes passing mention of the ancient "swerve" of the atoms espoused by [[Epicurus]]:

'I am not maintaining that determinism is true...it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

'"We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Hobart supports the existence of alternative possibilities for action and the capability to do otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html Alternative Possibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

And he clearly prefers "determination" to "determinism." Hobart's article is frequently misquoted as "Free Will as Involving Determinism."&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ncN3TuDQ7cC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Free+Will+As+Involving+Determinism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Q3OHYTn66&amp;sig=Rj7QYcAoy8x7oLrfDO9ZtACXhgk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vqu6S7jgEcWqlAfc1-3XBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Free%20Will%20As%20Involving%20Determinism%22&amp;f=false Fischer and Ravizza, Perspectives on moral responsibility], and even in the [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731000518/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippa Foot==

[[Philippa Foot]] is one who misquoted Hobart's title, but who had the same misgivings about determinism.

In 1957 she wrote an article in The Philosophical Review entitled "Free Will As Involving Determinism."

Nevertheless, she criticized arguments that free will requires indeterminism, and in particular the idea that one could not be held responsible for "chance" actions chosen for no particular reason.

Her article begins with the observation that determinism has become widely accepted as compatible with free will.

"The idea that free will can be reconciled with the strictest determinism is now very widely accepted. To say that a man acted freely is, it is often suggested, to say that he was not constrained, or that he could have done otherwise if he had chosen, or something else of that kind; and since these things could be true even if his action was determined it seems that there could be room for free will even within a universe completely subject to causal laws."&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;Philippa Foot "Free Will As Involving Determinism," ''The Philosophical Review'', vol LXVI, (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|439}}

Foot doubted that the ordinary language meaning of saying our actions are "determined" by motives has the same meaning as strict physical determinism, which assumes a causal law that determines every event in the future of the universe.

She notes that our normal use of "determined" does not imply universal determinism.

"For instance, an action said to be determined by the desires of the man who does it is not necessarily an action for which there is supposed to be a sufficient condition. In saying that it is determined by his desires we may mean merely that he is doing something that he wants to do, or that he is doing it for the sake of something else that he wants. There is nothing in this to suggest determinism in [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s sense."&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|441}}

Foot cited Bertrand Russell's view of causal determinism:

"The law of universal causation . . . may be enunciated as follows:...given the state of the whole universe,...every previous and subsequent event can theoretically be determined."

{{Certainty}}
The '''problem of induction''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] question of whether [[inductive reasoning]] leads to [[knowledge]] understood in the [[Justified true belief|classic philosophical sense]],&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#CanIndJus "Can induction be justified?"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

# Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that "all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white", before the discovery of [[black swan]]s) or
# Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the [[laws of physics]] will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |title=''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9662/pg9662.txt |work=Gutenberg Press }}#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem calls into question all [[empirical]] claims made in everyday life or through the [[scientific method]], and, for that reason, the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] said that "induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy." Although the problem arguably dates back to the [[Pyrrhonism]] of [[ancient philosophy]], as well as the [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], [[David Hume]] popularized it in the mid-18th century.

== Formulation of the problem ==
[[File:Buck Creek IN - sunrise.jpg|thumb|Usually inferred from repeated observations: ''"The sun always rises in the east"''.]]
[[File:Vainaja kannethaan.jpg|thumb|Usually not inferred from repeated observations: ''"If someone dies, it's never me"''.]]
In [[inductive reasoning]], one makes a series of observations and [[inference|infers]] a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, [[David Hume]] would even argue that we cannot claim it is "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated this point in ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'':

{{Cquote
| quote = Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
| 2 = 
}}

In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;This story is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient and early modern origins===
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic [[Sextus Empiricus]] first questioned the validity of inductive reasoning, positing that a universal rule could not be established from an incomplete set of particular instances. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite.}}

The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the [[circular reasoning]] of induction. However, Weintraub claims in [[The Philosophical Quarterly]]&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460-470&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''ad infinitum''.}}

Although the [[regress argument|criterion argument]] applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument "is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular." She concludes that "Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction." She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern [[foundationalism]].

The [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]], a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, pg 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dasgupta - A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century Indian skeptic, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa|Jayarasi Bhatta]], also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Balcerowicz, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/ "Jayarāśi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of Jayarāśi's Scepticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[William of Ockham]] connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232-3, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duns Scotus]] however argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings'', trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh:, 1962), 109-10; Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 17th-century [[Jesuits]] argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 223-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume &lt;!--'Hume's scepticism about induction' and 'Hume's skepticism about induction' redirect here--&gt;===
Few philosophers are as associated with induction as [[David Hume]]. He described the problem in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', §4, based on his [[epistemology|epistemological]] framework. Here, "reason" refers to [[deductive reasoning]] and "induction" refers to [[inductive reasoning]].

First, Hume ponders the discovery of [[causality|causal relations]], which form the basis for what he refers to as "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another",&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually happen with the balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.

Next, Hume ponders the justification of induction. If all matters of fact are based on causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must be shown to be valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" and the proposition "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects".&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers to come up with a (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be [[begging the question]]. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.

In this way, the problem of induction is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived by induction, but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#JusInd The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction===
{{main|New riddle of induction}}
[[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled "The New Riddle of Induction". Goodman proposed the new [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast'' (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, "will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/grue.html Goodman’s original definition of grue]&lt;/ref&gt;) observed to be green before a certain time ''t'', or blue if observed after that time. The "new" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time ''t'' we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

– Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time ''t'').

– Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate "grue" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after ''t'', will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

Goodman, however, points out that the predicate "grue" only appears more complex than the predicate "green" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of "grue" and "bleen" (where bleen is blue before time ''t'', or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider "green" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are "entrenched" in our language.

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] offers a practical solution to this problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Nicholas Rescher]]|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: Quine (1969), ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'', Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim that only predicates that identify a "[[natural kind]]" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. [[Roy Bhaskar|R. Bhaskar]] also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the  possibility  of  a  reason for the predicate,  located  in  the  enduring  nature  of  something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Realist Theory of Science|last=Bhaskar|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-45494-0|location=New York|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green [[beryl]], made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===
{{See also|David Hume#Induction_and_causation|l1=David Hume on the problem of induction}}
Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the ''Enquiry'', titled "Skeptical solution of these doubts". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and "without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses."&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
[[David Stove]]'s argument for induction, based on the [[statistical syllogism]], was presented in the ''Rationality of Induction'' and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late [[Donald Cary Williams]] (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book ''The Ground of Induction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Cary Williams | title=The Ground of Induction | location=New York | publisher=Russell and Russell | year=1947 }}, {{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ |title=Donald Cary Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset "matches" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or "representative" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stove, ''The Rationality of Induction'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biting the Bullett: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inacessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taking into account by [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] by considering that to be built a concept must be reapplied, what demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction &lt;ref&gt;"One form of Skepticism about Induction", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) ''The Justification of the Induction''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently - ''contra'' Hume - some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, what would make some inductive procedure always possible.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa: ''Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy'', Appendix to Ch. V, CSP, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification "begs for an authoritarian answer". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', section 43&lt;/ref&gt; Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so  there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| accessdate = 27 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=Critical rationalism: A restatement and defense |date=1994 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a [[justificationism|justification]] for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bullemore, [https://www.academia.edu/4154895/Some_Remarks_on_the_Pragmatic_Problem_of_Induction "Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction"], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CGJung.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Synchronicity''' ({{lang-de|Synchronizität}}) is a concept, first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Jung furnished several different definitions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard D. Beitman (2009) "Coincidence Studies: A Freudian Perspective..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle," "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism." He introduced the concept as early as the 1920s but gave a full statement of it only in 1951 in an [[Eranos]] lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, Ann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0g8chpSOI3AC&amp;printsec=frontcover "Who Owns Jung?"], Karnac Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1-85575-403-7}}. Cf. page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Jung published a paper "Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge" (Synchronicity&amp;nbsp;– An Acausal Connecting Principle)&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in a volume which also contained a related study by the physicist and Nobel laureate [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|title=Religion, Science, and Synchronicity|author=Roderick Main|year=2000|work=Harvest: Journal for Jungian Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208041508/http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|archivedate=2006-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sometimes critical of Jung's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metanexus Institute]] Charlene P. E. Burns (2011) [http://www.metanexus.net/essay/wolfgang-pauli-carl-jung-and-acausal-connecting-principle-case-study-transdisciplinarity Wolfgang Pauli, Carl Jung, and the Acausal Connecting Principle: A Case Study in Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Events connected by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of causality, which does not generally contradict the [[Axiom of Causality]].

Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick /&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of synchronicity as extending beyond mere coincidence (as well as the paranormal generally) is widely rejected in the academic and scientific community.

==Description==
[[File:Schéma synchronicité in English.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity]]
Jung coined the word "synchronicity" to describe "temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events." In his book ''[[Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle]]'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |edition=first Princeton/Bollingen paperback|date=1973 |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle |page=8|location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation| How are we to recognize acausal combinations of events, since it is obviously impossible to examine all chance happenings for their causality? The answer to this is that acausal events may be expected most readily where, on closer reflection, a causal connection appears to be inconceivable.}}

In the introduction to his book, ''Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal'', Roderick Main wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The culmination of Jung's lifelong engagement with the paranormal is his theory of synchronicity, the view that the structure of reality includes a principle of acausal connection which manifests itself most conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult, flawed, prone to misrepresentation, this theory none the less remains one of the most suggestive attempts yet made to bring the [[paranormal]] within the bounds of intelligibility.  It has been found relevant by psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of spiritual experience and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of the paranormal.}}

In his book ''Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"/&gt;
{{quotation|...it is impossible, with our present resources, to explain [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], or the fact of meaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of the causal explanation as well, for "effect" cannot be understood as anything except a phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect, but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of this quality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term "synchronicity" to designate a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.}}

Synchronicity was a principle which, Jung felt, gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; It described a governing dynamic which underlies the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic [[paradigm]] was a significant move away from [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] towards an underlying philosophy of [[double-aspect theory]]. Some argue this shift was essential to bringing theoretical coherence to Jung's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2014). Evolving Attitudes. ''International Journal of Jungian Studies'', 6.3, 243–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this [[phenomenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at Jung's presentation of his work on synchronicity in 1951 at an [[Eranos]] lecture, his ideas on synchronicity were evolving.  On Feb. 25, 1953, in a letter to Carl Seelig, the Swiss author and journalist who wrote a biography of Albert Einstein, Jung wrote, "Professor Einstein was my guest on several occasions at dinner. . . These were very early days when Einstein was developing his first theory of relativity [and] It was he who first started me on thinking about a possible relativity of time as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than 30 years later the stimulus led to my relation with the physicist professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity /&gt; 

Following discussions with both [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Jung believed there were parallels between synchronicity and aspects of [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Igor V. Limar |title=Carl G. Jung’s Synchronicity and Quantum Entanglement: Schrödinger’s Cat ‘Wanders’ Between Chromosomes |url=http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/view/376  |journal=NeuroQuantology |volume= 09 |page=313 |year=2011 |archiveurl = https://www.academia.edu/1248055/Carl_G._Jung_s_Synchronicity_and_Quantum_Entanglement_Schrodinger_s_Cat_Wanders_Between_Chromosomes |archivedate = 2011-06-30| issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2018}} 

Jung believed life was not a series of random events but rather an expression of a deeper order, which he and Pauli referred to as ''[[Unus mundus]]''. This deeper order led to the insights that a person was both embedded in a universal wholeness and that the realisation of this was more than just an intellectual exercise, but also had elements of a spiritual awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Revelations of Chance: Synchronicity as Spiritual Experience|date=2007|publisher=The State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the religious perspective, synchronicity shares similar characteristics of an "intervention of grace". Jung also believed that in a person's life, synchronicity served a role similar to that of dreams, with the purpose of shifting a person's egocentric conscious thinking to greater wholeness.

==Examples==
[[File:Cetonia-aurata.jpg|thumb|''[[Cetonia aurata]]'']]
In his book ''Synchronicity'' Jung tells the following story as an example of a synchronistic event:
{{Quote|text=My example concerns a young woman patient who, in spite of efforts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible. The difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably "geometrical" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab — a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer (''Cetonia aurata''), whose gold-green colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, "Here is your scarab." This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=C.G. |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1969 |publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 |pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French writer [[Émile Deschamps]] claims in his memoirs that, in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete – and in the same instant, the now-senile de Fontgibu entered the room, having got the wrong address.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Deschamps, Oeuvres completes : Tomes I–VI, Reimpr. de l'ed. de Paris 1872–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote, after describing some examples, "When coincidences pile up in this way, one cannot help being impressed by them – for the greater the number of terms in such a series, or the more unusual its character, the more improbable it becomes."&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung  Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|left|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli]]In his book ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory'' (1966), George Gamow writes about [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was apparently considered a person particularly associated with synchronicity events. Gamow whimsically refers to the "[[Pauli effect]]", a mysterious phenomenon which is not understood on a purely materialistic basis, and probably never will be. The following anecdote is told:
{{Quotation|It is well known that theoretical physicists cannot handle experimental equipment; it breaks whenever they touch it. Pauli was such a good theoretical physicist that something usually broke in the lab whenever he merely stepped across the threshold. A mysterious event that did not seem at first to be connected with Pauli's presence once occurred in Professor J. Franck's laboratory in Göttingen. Early one afternoon, without apparent cause, a complicated apparatus for the study of atomic phenomena collapsed. Franck wrote humorously about this to Pauli at his Zürich address and, after some delay, received an answer in an envelope with a Danish stamp. Pauli wrote that he had gone to visit Bohr and at the time of the mishap in Franck's laboratory his train was stopped for a few minutes at the Göttingen railroad station. You may believe this anecdote or not, but there are many other observations concerning the reality of the Pauli Effect! &lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory, George Gamow, p. 64, Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc. New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Causality]], when defined expansively (as for instance in the "mystic psychology" book ''[[The Kybalion]]'', or in the [[plato]]nic [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]-style [[Axiom of Causality]]), states that "nothing can happen without being caused." Such an understanding of causality may be incompatible with synchronicity. Other definitions of causality (for example, the [[David Hume#Causation|neo-Humean]] definition) are concerned only with the relation of cause to effect. As such, they are compatible with synchronicity. There are also opinions which hold that, where there is no external observable cause, the cause can be internal.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologies of Mind: The Collected Papers of [[John Maze]], edited by Rachael Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also pointed out that, since Jung took into consideration only the narrow definition of causality – only the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]] – his notion of "''acausality''" is also narrow and so is not applicable to [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] and [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal]] causes as understood in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] or [[Thomism|Thomist]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;James Arraj (1996) ''The Mystery of Matter: Nonlocality, Morphic Resonance, Synchronicity and the Philosophy of Nature of St. Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.innerexplorations.com/catchmeta/mys8.htm ch. 8. Synchronicity and Formal Causality]''&lt;/ref&gt; The final causality is inherent&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mansfield, (1995), ''Synchronicity, Science and Soul-Making: Understanding Jungian Synchronicity Through Physics, Buddhism, and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; in synchronicity (because it leads to [[individuation]]) or synchronicity can be a kind of replacement for final causality; however, such [[finalism]] or [[teleology]] is considered to be outside the domain of modern science.

==Explanations==

===Religion===

Many people believe that the Universe or God causes synchronicities. Among the general public, divine intervention is the most widely accepted explanation for meaningful coincidences.&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Mathematics===

Jung and his followers (e.g., Marie-Louise von Franz) share in common the belief that numbers are the archetypes of order, and the major participants in synchronicity creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Number and Time: Reflections Leading toward a Unification of Depth Psychology and Physics. |last=Von Franz |first=M.L. |year= 1974 |publisher=Northwestern University Press|}}&lt;/ref&gt;This hypothesis has implications that are relevant to some of the “chaotic” phenomena in nonlinear dynamics. [[Dynamical systems theory]] has provided a new context from which to speculate about synchronicity because it gives predictions about the transitions between emergent states of order and nonlocality.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, G. B. (2005). The self, the symbolic and synchronicity: Virtual realities and the emergence of the psyche. ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 50, 271–284. https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8774.2005.00531.x&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is not part of mainstream mathematical thought.

===Quantum Physics===

According to a certain view, synchronicity serves as a way of making sense of or describing some aspects of quantum mechanics. It argues that quantum experiments demonstrate that, at least in the microworld of subatomic particles, there is an instantaneous connection between particles no matter how far away they are from one another. Known as quantum non-locality or [[Quantum_entanglement|entanglement]], the proponents of this view argue that this points to a unified field that precedes physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics.|last=Stapp |first=H.P. |year= 2015 |publisher=Springer Verlag  |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with archetypal reasoning, the proponents argue that two events can correspond to each other (e.g. particle with particle, or person with person) in a meaningful way. 

Synchronicity can also be seen in [[David Bohm]]'s theory of [[implicate order]]. According to Bohm's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wholeness and the implicate order.|last=Bohm |first=David |year= 1980 |publisher=Routledge   |location=London, UK|}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory, there are three major realms of existence: the explicate (unfolded) order, the implicate (enfolded) order, and a source or ground beyond both. The flowing movement of the whole can thus be understood as a process of continuous enfolding and unfolding of order or structure. From moment to moment there is a rhythmic pulse between implicate and explicate realities. Therefore, synchronicity would literally take place as the bridge between implicate and explicate orders, whose complementary nature define the undivided totality.

===Probability theory===

Mainstream mathematics argues that statistics and probability theory (exemplified in, e.g., [[Littlewood's law]] or the [[law of truly large numbers]]) suffice to explain any purported synchronistic events as mere [[coincidence]]s.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;John Navin, interview with [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]], (2014), [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2014/02/18/why-coincidences-miracles-and-rare-events-happen-every-day/3/ Why Coincidences, Miracles And Rare Events Happen Every Day], [[Forbes]].com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lane &amp; Andrea Diem Lane, 2010, [http://www.integralworld.net/lane15.html DESULTORY DECUSSATION Where Littlewood’s Law of Miracles meets Jung’s Synchronicity], www.integralworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; The law of large numbers, for instance, states that in large enough populations, any strange event is arbitrarily likely to happen by mere chance. However, some proponents of synchronicity question whether it is even sensible in principle to try to evaluate synchronicity statistically. Jung himself and von Franz argued that statistics work precisely by ignoring what is unique about the individual case, whereas synchronicity tries to investigate that uniqueness.  

Among some psychologists, Jung's works, such as ''The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche'', were received as problematic. Fritz Levi, in his 1952 review in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (New Swiss Observations), critiqued Jung's theory of synchronicity as vague in determinability of synchronistic events, saying that Jung never specifically explained his rejection of "magic causality" to which such an acausal principle as synchronicity would be related. He also questioned the theory's usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bishop|first = Paul|title = Synchronicity and Intellectual Intuition in Kant, Swedenborg, and Jung| publisher = The Edwin Mellen Press

===Psychology===

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], [[confirmation bias]] is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, and avoids information and interpretations that contradict prior beliefs. It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and represents an error of [[inductive inference]], or is a form of [[selection bias]] toward confirmation of the hypothesis under study, or disconfirmation of an alternative hypothesis. Confirmation bias is of interest in the teaching of [[critical thinking]], as the skill is misused if rigorous critical scrutiny is applied only to evidence that challenges a preconceived idea, but not to evidence that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/timvangelder/publications-1/heads-i-win-tails-you-lose-desire-s-hold-over-reason/HeadsIWin.pdf Tim van Gelder, "Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in psychology and sociology, the term [[apophenia]] is used for the mistaken detection of a pattern or meaning in random or meaningless data.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter. "From Haunted Brain to Haunted Science: A Cognitive Neuroscience View of Paranormal and Pseudoscientific Thought", ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by J. Houran and R. Lange (North Carolina: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. Publishers]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, such as Robert Todd Carroll of the Skeptic's Dictionary, argue that the perception of synchronicity is better explained as apophenia. Primates use pattern detection in their form of intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201828 Pattern recognition of behavioral events in the nonhuman primate]&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to erroneous identification of non-existent patterns. A famous example of this is the fact that human face recognition is so robust, and based on such a basic archetype (essentially two dots and a line contained in a circle), that human beings are very prone to identify faces in random data all through their environment, like the "man in the moon", or faces in wood grain, an example of the visual form of apophenia known as [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html|title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher=New York Times|first=Elizabeth | last=Svoboda | date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Charles Tart]] sees danger in synchronistic thinking: 'This danger is the temptation to mental laziness. [...] it would be very tempting to say, "Well, it's synchronistic, it's forever beyond my understanding," and so (prematurely) give up trying to find a causal explanation.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tart]],  [http://www.roma1.infn.it/rog/group/frasca/b/synchtart.html Causality and Synchronicity – Steps Toward Clarification], (1981), [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], vol. 75, pp. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyway, synchronicity cannot be attained to by mere intellectual means. It is an autonomous phenomenon that is not invented by the intellect, but rather, experienced. synchronicity is a self produced image spontaneously blossoming from the psyche as a whole that simultaneously reflects and effects what is going on within the very psyche that produced it. It has also been argued that [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology's]] theory of synchronicity is equivalent to intellectual [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transactionalism''' is a philosophical approach that addresses the fundamental nature of social exchange or human transaction; that all human exchange is best understood as a set of transactions within a reciprocal and co-constitutive whole. A transactionalist demands that all human exchange, including learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpbeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=transactionalism+zoology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_heb31M_UAhUX3mMKHb2wDMsQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=interaction%20and%20transaction&amp;f=false|title=Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development|last=Kolb|first=David A.|date=2014-12-17|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780133892505|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is best understood as a transactional whole shaped and defined by a set of experiences in an ecology that are all-at-once biological, socio-linguistic, and intellectual; "man is an information-processing, organizing, open-energy system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study (paperback)|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2017-03-18|publisher=Independently published|year=|isbn=9781520829319|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=99|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention must be paid to organizing acts within, and as-if always, a reciprocal and co-constitutive, exchange whether it be in buying and selling, teaching and learning, in a marital contract, or a social situation in-person or online.

== Definition ==
Stemming from the Latin ''transigere'' ("˜to drive through", "to accomplish"), the root word "transaction" is not restricted to the economic sense of ''buying and selling'' or merely a [[financial transaction]]. A much larger field of exchange is employed such as, "any sort of social interaction, such as verbal communication, eye contact, or touch. A 'stroke' [of one's hand] is an act of recognition of a transaction" as employed in psychology with [[transactional analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disorders.org/relationships/transactional-analysis/|title=Transactional Analysis|work=Disorders.org - Find Therapists, Counselors, and Treatment Centers|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It not only examines exchanges, or "transactions," between borrower and lender, but encompasses any transaction involving people and objects whether it involves "borrowing-lending, buying-selling, writing-reading, parent-child, and husband-wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|page=|pages=33|language=English|chapter=Transactionalism Viewed Historically|orig-year=1969|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [https://www.influenceecology.com/distinctionary/transaction/ transaction], then is "a creative act, engaged in by one who, by virtue of his participation in the act – of which he is always an ''aspect'', never an ''entity'' – together with the other participants, be they human or otherwise environmental, becomes [,] in the process [,] modified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=75|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dewey offered a sophisticated, yet [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to understanding man as an organism-environment purposefully designed to correct the "fragmentation of experience" often found in other philosophical approaches found in [[Subjectivism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] and [[Skepticism]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Transactionalism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

He asserted that human life is not organized into separate entities, as if the mind (emotions, feelings, creativity, imagination) and the world outside it (raw and manufactured goods as well as social roles and institutions such as family, school, and media) are irreconcilable, leading to the question "How does the mind know the world?"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/10.4135/9781506335193.n4|title=Pragmatism and the Philosophical Foundations of Mixed Methods Research1|last=Biesta|first=Gert|pages=95–118|doi=10.4135/9781506335193.n4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor J. Phillips]] (1927–2016), American professor emeritus in educational foundations and inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/Retirees/documents/newsletters/May-2016.pdf|title=BGSU (Bowling Green State University) Retirees Association Newsletter, Vol. 21|last=|first=|date=May 2016|work=|access-date=2016-07-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bowling Green State University]] from 1963 to 1996, wrote a comprehensive review of the historical, philosophical, psychological, and educational development of transactionalism in his 1966 dissertation "Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study" republished in 2013 by Influence Ecology.  Phillips traced transactionalism's philosophical roots to Greek historians [[Polybius]] and [[Plato]], 17th century polymath and architect of the scientific revolution Galileo, as well as the architect of modern western philosophy, [[René Descartes]].

Galileo's contributions to the scientific revolution rested on an understanding of transactionalism from which he argued Aristotelian physics was wrong, as he wrote in ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' (1632):&lt;blockquote&gt;"In that case, if it is denied that circular motion is peculiar to celestial bodies, and affirmed to belong to all naturally movable bodies, then one must choose one of two necessary consequences. Either the attributes of generable-ingenerable, alterable-inalterable, divisibleindivisible, etc., suit equally and commonly all world bodies – as much the celestial as the elemental – or Aristotle has wrongly and erroneously deduced, from circular motion, those attributes which he has assigned to celestial bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html|title=Galileo Galilei {{!}} Calendars|website=www.webexhibits.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The philosophy abandons self-actional and interaction-al beliefs or suppositions as problem-solving in an objective world where co-operative exchange creates value in learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt; and the foundation of transactional competence, how objects including people behave.  Galileo deviated from the then current Aristotelian thinking, which was defined by mere interactions rather than co-constituetive transacting among people with different interests who may be solving competing intentions or conditions of life.

=== Modern antecedents ===
Trevor Phillips also outlined the philosophy's more recent developments found in the American philosophical works of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] ([[symbolic interactionism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|edition=2|location=|pages=54|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; pragmatist [[William James]], educational philosopher [[John Dewey]],&lt;ref name="Pronko 229–254"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pronko|first=N.

Bentley|Arthur Bentley]].

Several sources credit anthropologist [[Fredrik Barth]] as the scholar first to apply the term 'transactionalism" in 1959.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/barth_fredrik.htm|title=Barth, Fredrik - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts|website=www.anthrobase.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444332094_chunk_g978144433209423_ss1-50|title=Transactionalism or Transactional Analysis : Concise Dictionary of Social and Cultural Anthropology : Blackwell Reference Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blackwellreference.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a critique of structural functionalism, Barth offered a new interpretation of culture that did not portray an overly cohesive picture of society without attending to the "roles, relationships, decisions, and innovations of the individual."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|title=Transactionalism - Dictionary &amp; Encyclopedia|website=www.encyclopedia69.com|access-date=2016-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727225546/http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|archivedate=July 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are transacting with one another at multiple levels of individual, group, and environment. Barth's study appears to not fully articulate how this is happening all-at-once as opposed to as if separate entities interacting (interactional):&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he "environment" of any ethnic group is not only defined by natural conditions, but also by the presence and activities of other ethnic groups on which it depends. Each group exploits only a section of the total environment [perhaps in keeping with the idea of a "transactional whole"], and leaves large parts of it open for other groups to exploit (p. 1079).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1956|title=Ecologic Relationships of Ethnic Groups in Swat, North Pakistan|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1079–1089|doi=10.1525/aa.1956.58.6.02a00080|jstor=666295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Using examples from the people of the [[Swat District|Swat district]] of North [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and, later, in 1966, organization among Norwegian fishermen, Barth set out to demonstrate that social forms like [[kinship]] groups, economic institutions, and political alliances are generated by the actions and strategies of the individuals who deploy organized acts against a context of social [[Theory of constraints|constraints]]. "By observing how people interact with each other [through experience], an insight could be gained into the [interactional] nature of the competition, values and principles that govern individuals' choices."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This insight would be interactional at best and not transactional—reciprocal and co-constituetive transactions at the levels of individual, group, and environment (including man-as-organism and its ecological situations).

Some scholars argue transactionalism is a theory rather than philosophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7hEAAAAIAAJ|title=Models of Social Organization|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1966-01-01|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barth's contribution was initially criticized for paying insufficient attention to cultural constraints on individualism though it influenced the qualitative method known as [[symbolic interactionism]] used in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsiAAAAAMAAJ|title=Transaction and meaning: directions in the anthropology of exchange and symbolic behavior|last=Kapferer|first=Bruce|last2=Issues|first2=Institute for the Study of Human|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Institute for the Study of Human Issues|isbn=9780915980048|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pragmatic and philosophical approach, transactionalism is recognizable in the theory of the "[[The Sociological Imagination|sociological imagination]]" by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] (1959), in which personal troubles are linked to public issues. In other words, the ''transactional whole'' is not readily apparent at the level of individuals who at that level operate in a self-actional manner when larger forces of sociality, history, biology, and culture are all-at-once at work as part of a global dynamic. Humans are never outside this dynamic current; operating the system in some self-actional or even interactional way.

=== 21st century applications ===

==== Transactional competence ====
Modern architects of the philosophy are John Patterson and Kirkland Tibbels, co-founders of Influence Ecology, acquired, edited, and published, Phillips' dissertation (as is) in 2013. With a foreword written by Tibbels, a hardback and Kindle version was published under the title ''Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monograph is an account of how human [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] came to be viewed less as the behavior of static and/or mutually isolated entities, and more as dynamic aspects of events in the process of problem-solving, and thereby becoming or satisfying, the unavoidable and inescapable conditions of human life.

==== Transactional leadership (LAP) ====
In a new model of [[Organizational behavior|organizational management]] known as the "leadership-as-practice" Dewey and Bentley's [[Knowing and the Known]] categories of action—self-action, inter-action, and trans-action brings transactionalism into the C-suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=171|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transactional leadership practice is defined by its "trans-actors" who "enact new and unfolding meanings in on-going trans-actions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; situated in contrast to an older model leadership defined by self-actional (self-actors) and inter-actional (inter-actors) practices. In the latter, actors and situations often remain unchanged. In Leadership-as-Practice, Joseph A. Raelin distinguishes between a "[[Deliberate practice|practice]]" that extends and amplifies the meaning of work and its value vs. "practices" that are habitual and sequential activities evoked to simplify everyday routines. A transactional approach—leadership-as-practice—focuses attention on "existing entanglements, complexities, processes, [while also] distinguishing problems in order to coordinate roles, acts, and practices within a group or organization."  Said another way, "trans-action attends to emergent becoming"—a kind of seeing together--"rather than substantive being (Tsoukas and Chia 2002)" among the actors involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=snippet&amp;q=inter-action&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics: transactional (vs. self-actional or interactional) ===
The transactional view of metaphysics—studying the nature of reality or what is real—deals with the inseparability of what is known and how humans inquire into what is known—both ''knowing and the known''.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of Aristotle, humans have shifted from one paradigm or system of "logic" to another before a transactional metaphysics evolved with a focus that examines and inquires into solving problems first and foremost based on the relationship of man as a biological organism (with a brain and a body) shaped by its environment. In the book ''Transactionalism'' (2015), the nature of reality is traced historically from ''self-action'' to ''interaction'' to ''transactional'' competence each as its own ''age of knowing'' or [[episteme]]''.''

The pre-Galilean age of knowing is defined by ''self-action'' "where things [and thereby people] are viewed as acting on their own powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'', Dewey and Bentley wrote, "The epistemologies, logics, psychologies and sociologies [of our day] are still largely [understood] on a self-actional basis."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The result of Newtonian physics'', interaction'' marks the second age of knowing; a system marked especially by the "third 'law of motion'—that action and reaction are equal and opposite".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The third [[episteme]] is ''transactional'' competence''.''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An historical and interpretive study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=2013|isbn=|location=Ojai, CA.|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With origins in the contributions of Darwin, "man's understandings are finite as opposed to infinite. In the same way, his views, goals, commitments, and beliefs have relative status as opposed to absolute."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=92|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dewey and Arthur Bentley asserted this competence as "the right to see together, extensionally and durationally, much that is talked about conventionally as if it were composed of irreconcilable separates."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; We tend to avoid considering our actions as part of a dynamic and transactional whole, whether in mundane or complex activities; whether in making an invitation, request, or offer or in the complex management of a program or company. We tend to avoid studying, thinking, and planning our moves and moods for a comprehensive, reciprocal, and co-constitutive—in other words, ''transactional''—whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing and the known.|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur F.|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1949|isbn=978-0837184982|location=Boston|pages=104|quote=Referencing Arthur F. Bentley, Inquiry into Inquiries. Boston: The Beacon Press, 1954, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transactional whole includes the organized acts including ideas, narratives, people as resources implementing ideas, services, and products, the things involved, settings, and personalities, all considered in and over time. With this competence, that which ''acts'' and is ''acted upon'' become united for a moment in a mutual or ethical exchange, where both are reciprocally transformed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; contradicting "any absolute separation or isolation"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=74–5|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; often found in the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] thinking and categorization of [[Western thought]].

Dualistic thinking and categorization often lead to over-simplification of the transactional whole found in the convenient but ineffective resorting to "exclusive classifications." Such classifications tend to exclude and reify man as if he has dominion over his nature or the environment.

In his seminal 20th century work ''Physics and Philosophy'', [[Werner Heisenberg|Warner Heisenberg]] reflects this kind of transactionalist thinking: "What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” The together-at-once reality of man as organism-environment is often overlooked in the dualistic thinking of even major philosophers like Descartes who is often referenced for his "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" philosophy. Of a transactionalist approach, Heisenberg writes, "This was a possibility of which [[René Descartes|Descartes]] could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation of the world and I impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJjuAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=questioning|title=Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|date=2007-05-08|publisher=HarperCollins|year=|isbn=9780061209192|location=|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dualistic thinking prevents man from thinking. "In the spirit of [Charles Sanders] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], transactionalism substitutes continuity for discontinuity, change and interdependence for separateness."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=80|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in problem solving, whenever we "insert a name instead of a problem," when words like "soul," "mind," "need," "I.Q." or "trait" are expressed as if real, they have the power to block and distort free inquiry into what is known in fact or as fact in the transactional whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=81|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nature of change and being, "that which ''acts'' and that which is ''acted upon''" always undergo a reciprocal relationship that is affected by the presence and influence of the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  We as human beings, as part of nature as an [[organism]] "integral to (as opposed to separate from, above or outside of) any investigation and inquiry may use a transactionalist approach to expand our personal [[knowledge]] so as to solve life's complex problems.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=45|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of ''transactionalism'' is not to discover what is already there, but for a person to seek and interpret senses, objects, places, positions, or any aspect of transactions between one's Self and one's environment (including objects, other people, and their symbolic interactions) in terms of the aims and desires each one needs and wants to satisfy and fulfill. It is essential that one simultaneously take into account the needs and desires of others in one's environment or ecology to avoid the self-actional or self-empowerment ideology of a rugged and competitive individualism. While other philosophies may discuss similar ethical concerns, this co-constitutive and reciprocal element of problem-solving is central to transactionalism.

To put it simply, "to experience is to transact; in point of fact, experience is a transaction of organism-environment."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In other words, what is "known" by the knower (or organism) is always filtered and shaped by both internal and external moods and narratives, mirrored in and through our relationships to the physical affordances and constraints in our environment or in specific ecologies.

The metaphysics of transactional inquiry is characterized in the pragmatic writing of William James who insists that "single barreled terms," terms like "thought" and "thing," actually stop or block inquiries into what is known and how we know it. Instead, a transactional orientation of ‘double-barreledness’ or the "interdependence of aspects of experience" must always be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=69|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; James offers his readers insight into the "double-barreledness" of experience with an apt proposition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem [the thing] or is it a feeling in our mind [the thought]? Practically we treat it as both or as either, according to the temporary direction of our thought. The ‘experienced’ and the ‘experiencing,’ the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing,’ are, in actuality, only names for a single fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=70|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=53|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is real then, from a transactionist perspective, must be constantly reevaluated relative to man as organism-environment in a co-constituitive and reciprocal dynamic with people, personalities, situations, aims, and given the needs each party seeks to satisfy.

=== Epistemology: truth from inquiry ===
Transactionalists are firmly intolerant of "anything resembling an 'ultimate' truth -- or 'absolute' knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=101|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolution of psychology about the nature of man, transactionalists reject the notion of a mind-body split or anything resembling the bifurcation of what they perceive as the circuitry in which our biological stimulus-response exists. Examples transactionalists reject include the self-acting notions of Aristotle who posited that "the soul -- the psyche -- realized itself in and through the body, and that matter and form were two aspects involved in all existence." Later, the claims of French philosopher René Descartes, recognized as the father of modern Western philosophy, were examined and defined as "interactional". Descartes suggested  stimulus-response as the realm where the mind controls the body and the body may influence the rational mind out of the passion of our emotions.

Transactionalists recognize Cartesian dualism as a form of disintegrating the transactional whole of man "into two complete substances, joined to another no one knows how."&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream of Descartes|last=Maritain|first=J.|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1944|isbn=|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/pineal-gland/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lokhorst|first=Gert-Jan|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body as a physical entity, on the one hand, and the soul or thought, on the other, was regarded in a Cartesian mindset as "an angel inhabiting a machine and directing it by means of the pineal gland"&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"/&gt; This tranactionalists reject.

Man has the propensity to treat the mind and thought or the mind and body as abstractions and this tendency to deny the interrelatedness or coordinated continuity results in misconceptions in learning and inaccurate thinking as humans move and thrive with an ecology.  Accurate thinking and learning begins and is constantly developed through action resulting from thought as a repetitive circuit of experience known in psychology as deliberate practice. Educational philosopher Trevor Phillips, now deceased, frames this tendency to falsely organize our perception: "[W]e fail to realize that we can know nothing about things [or ourselves] beyond their significance to us," otherwise we distort our "reality" and treat things we perceive within it, including our bodies or mind, as if concrete thereby "denying the interconnectedness of realities" (plural).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists suggest that accurate (or inaccurate) thinking is rarely considered an unintended consequence of our propensity for abstractions.

When an individual transacts through intelligent or consequential actions circumscribed within the constraints and conditions of her/his environment in a reflexive, repetitive arc of learned experience, there is a "transaction between means and ends" (see reference below). This transactional approach features twin aspects of a larger event rather than merely manipulating the means to an end in our circumstances and situations. For instance, a goal can never be produced by abstraction, by simply thinking about or declaring a promise to produce a result. Nor can it be anticipated or foreseen (an abstraction at best) without a significant "pattern of inquiry," as John Dewey later defined and articulated, into the constraints and conditions that happen and are happening given the interdependence of all the people and objects involved in a simple or complex transaction. The nature of our environment affects all these entities within a transaction. Thus, revealing the limiting and reductive notion of manipulating a psychology around stimulus and response found in Aristotilian or Cartesian thought.

A transaction is recognized here as one that occurs between the "means and ends;" in other words, transactional competence is derived from the "distinctions between the how, the what (or subject-matter), and the why (or what for)." This transactional whole constitutes a reciprocal connection and a reflexive arc of learned and lived experience.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=105|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a transactional approach one can derive a certain kind of value from one's social exchange. Value in knowing how, what, and why the work done with your mind and body fulfill on the kinds of transactions needed to live a good and satisfying life that functions well with others. Truth from actual inquiry is foundational for organism-environment to define and live by a set of workable ethical values that functions with others.

=== Ethics: reciprocal and co-constitutive ===
While ''self-interest'' governs the ethical principles of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], here the principle is that man as an organism is in a ''reciprocal, constitutive'' relationship with her/his environment. Disabusing the psychological supposition of our "skin-boundedness" (discussed further below), transactionalism rejects the notion that we are apart from our environment or that man has dominion over it. Man, woman, and child must view life and be viewed in the undifferentiated whole of ''organism-environment''. This reciprocal and co-constitutive relationship is what sets Transactionalism apart from other philosophies.

What John Dewey meant by "reciprocal" was that:&lt;blockquote&gt;... consequences have to be determined on the grounds of what is selected and handled as means in exactly the same sense in which the converse holds and demands constant attention if activities are to be intelligently conducted.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/John-Dewey-Arthur-Bentley-Correspondence/dp/B000OKT5RA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473454738&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ratner+and+altman|title=John Dewey and Arthur F.

Whether the environment is natural or man-made, whether discussing biology, sociology, culture, linguistics, history and memory, or economics and physics, every ''organism-environment'' is ''reciprocal, constitutive, socially-conditioned and'' constantly in flux demanding our ethical attention to conditions and consequences as we live life. [[John Dewey]] and [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], like [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] before them, were out to distinguish an ethical "living" logic rather than a static one.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Both rejected the supposition that man had dominion over or governed behavior in his/her environment embracing a presupposition of transactionalism; we are ''reciprocal, co-constitutive, socially-conditioned, and motivated'' "together-at-once" as we seek solutions to living a good life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=intradermal+psychological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe_q8yzG&amp;sig=4yqwJ_qzHyBZ425LEo-G26PNg38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieno3d_a_RAhWEZCYKHflKDdEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intradermal%20psychological&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transactionalists reject the "localization" of our psychology as if "skin-bound."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Bentley wrote, "No creature lives merely under its skin." In other words, we should not define and distinguish experience in and from the subjective mind and feelings. Conversely, we cannot rely solely on external circumstances or some static or inherited logic. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] said of followers of Aristotle in seeking ethical knowledge that one should "come with arguments and demonstrations of your own...but bring us no more texts and naked authorities, for our disputes are about the sensible world and not a paper one."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Humans are always transacting, "together-at-once,"&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=%22because+without+the+context,+the+action+would+not+be+the+action+it+is.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe-h8BEM&amp;sig=8AeBPz3oIbZXhHlQp8t3uZzOU8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc0pynpLDRAhVKylQKHVD2BjYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22because%20without%20the%20context,%20the%20action%20would%20not%20be%20the%20action%20it%20is.%22&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of, shaped by, and shap-ing the experience we call "knowledge" as an ''organism-environment''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley were intrigued by, and ultimately questioned, "the significance of the concept ‘skin’ and its role in philosophical and psychological thought."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They offered a biological or natural justification that came to define a transactionalist approach. The known and what is known are both a function of man having "evolved among other organisms" within natural selection or evolution.

Man's most intellectual and advanced "knowings" are not merely outgrowths of his own doing or being. The natural evolution of things outside our knowingness creates the very context in which our known and knowings arise. We are not inventing what is known outside or, in a vacuum beyond, who we are and who we are is an organism-environment together-at-once.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  We are not creatures separated by skin with an internal world of the mind and body "in here" separate from an environment of objects and people "out there". Human beings intelligently live, adapt to, and organize life in a reciprocal, co-constitutive experience that is what Dewey and Bentley term "trans-dermal".

A "trans-dermal" experience demands knowledgeable and accurate inquiry into the conditions and consequences of each transaction where the organizing of ideas and acts (knowledge), is itself a transaction which grows out of the problem-solving and creative exploring within the universe of social situations in which we exist. Dewey and Bentley wrote, "truth, or for that matter falsity, is a function of the deliberately striven for consequences arising out of inquiry."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Our behavior and acts in knowing, or transacting, must be considered "together" and "at-once" with its conditions and consequences for any ambitious movement or fulfillment to occur alone and among other people in any setting with objects and constructd inherited from others known and unknown over time. Transacting demands study, a slowing down of our movement, and the development of a transactional competence in order to fulfill certain needs or solve problems while functioning among others.

In Dewey's final days, wrote Phillips, he emphasized the twin aspects of attending to both the means and the ends of any transaction: "It is…impossible to have an end-in-view or to anticipate the consequences of any proposed line of action." A "trans-dermal" consciousness is, therefore, key to moving ethically. To move, experience life, or transact in a principled manner, considering the reciprocal and co-constituitive nature of organism-environment becomes an [[wikt:object lesson|object lesson]] governing both social behavior as well as in transacting from a trans-dermal view with objects or other bodies.

==== Trans-dermal experience ====
The work of Australian educational philosopher [[Vicki L. Lee]] further elucidates and breaks down what is "trans-dermal" experience—how it works and why it matters—based on her work in the [[philosophy of cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philpapers.org/s/Vicki%20L.%20Lee|title=Works by Vicki L. Lee - PhilPapers|website=philpapers.org|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[educational philosophy]], and [[radical behaviorism]] about which she has published extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=1987-01-01|title=The Structure of Conduct|journal=Behaviorism|volume=15|issue=2|pages=141–148|jstor=27759127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This complex paradigm is clearly evidenced by Lee in this thickly described example:   &lt;blockquote&gt;Acts are more than movements. ...Our discriminations depend on movements and their contexts seen together-at-once or as an undifferentiated whole. In discriminating watering the garden from hosing the driveway, we see the bodily movements and their occasion and results. We see the garden, the watering implement, and so forth, as much as we see the body's activities. The notion of together-at-once emphasizes that we do not see movements and contexts separately and then infer the action. Rather the context is internal to the action, because without the context, the action would not be the action it is.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A basic presupposition of the philosophy of transactionalism is to always consider that that which is known about the world (extra-dermal) is "directly concerned with the activity of the knower" which is merely from some sense of "skin-boundedness" (intra-dermal). The known and the knower, as Dewey and Bentley examined in detail in their collaborative publication, must always be considered "'twin aspects of common fact."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Behavior, movement, and acts are not merely a function of the mind, of wishful or positive thinking or belief in external forces, nor can it be determined ethically from the philosophers of the past or knowledge written in a book. It is our ability to transact trans-dermally—to be and become ecologically-fit as an organism-environment—that begets truthful inquiry into living a good and satisying life, functioning well among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Philosophy and Women's Studies Professor Shannon Sullivan explores and applies "transactional knowing through embodied and relational lived experience"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=182842|title=Living Across and Through Skins|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|date=2001|website=Indiana University Press|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a feminist epistemology developed out of the pragmatist tradition.

=== Politics: Cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry ===
The branch of philosophy recognized as "politics" concerns the governance of community and group interaction, not merely that of the state as conceived when thinking of a local or national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|last=Blackburn|first=Simon|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191799556|edition=3|location=http://www.oxfordreference.com|pages=s.v., "politics, philosophy of"|language=English|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Laws of Motion'' (1920), physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] articulated the modern conception of "transaction" used here—one that is not exclusive to an economic context limited to only the opposition of a buyer-seller in a trade or other analougous uses. Unlike its use in commercial affairs, there is a radical departure from any tendency to perceive buyer-seller (as well as organism-environment) as opposing or separate forces. In a transactionalist approach, Maxwell (as well as others) view the former and latter as "two parts of the same phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XXq9qgnWtbMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=j+maxwell+clerk+1920&amp;ots=0o8xj9QN40&amp;sig=BNp7vIN-FKXs47N2YQHYP6KT96g#v=onepage&amp;q=transaction&amp;f=false|title=Matter and Motion|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486668956|location=|pages=27|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley apply this notion of 'transactional' to learning more than any other context. In the educative process, acting without knowing is a separation of the same phenomenon enjoined in inquiry. Without inquiry acting does not work. Acting and knowing cooperate to provide knowledge to an organism-environment which must essentially involve inquiry into things that have happened and are happening: &lt;blockquote&gt;Knowledge – if the term is to be employed at all – is a name for the product of competent inquiries, and is constituted only as the outcome of a particular inquiry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is not "a process taking place, or as a status located in or at an animal organism."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Knowledge arises from inquiry and the testing of that inquiry to insure the fitness of not only the solution but the organism-environment. While a human being is central or "nuclear" to its organism-environment,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it must abdicate any sense of dominion over the socio-biological cosmos of which human being is part and never outside of. Each situation—and this transactionalists assert is radical—must be examined and determined by a construction of moves and action based on the capacity of that organism to fulfill its intentions and thrive (or not). Dewey and Bentley later insisted that knowing "as inquiry, [is therefore] a way, or distinct form, of behavior."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Transactionalists define politics in this philosophy as a cooperative, genuine interaction between all participating parties whether buyer-seller, student-teacher, or worker-boss given that we are biological and social subjects&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry/%5BJohn_Dewey%5D_Logic_-_The_Theory_of_Inquiry_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry"|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.org|publisher=|page=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved not merely in "transacting" for our own advantage or gain. "[S]ocial phenomena cannot be understood except as there is prior understanding of physical conditions and the laws of their [socio-biological] interactions," wrote [[John Dewey]] in ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; He added further, "Inquiry into [social phenomena], with respect both to data that are significant and to their relations or proper ordering, is conditioned upon extensive prior knowledge of physical phenomena and their laws. This fact accounts in part for the retarded and immature state of social subjects." Thus, cooperation and knowing as inquiry is foundational to governing communal affairs of any kind including economic trade and the educative process.

In our existing models of formal education, we bifurcate what Dewey viewed as indispensable. We, as a rule, segregate "utility and culture, absorption and expression, theory and practice....in any educational scheme"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=165|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, progressive educator [[Elsie Ripley Clapp]] distinguished a similar commitment to "cooperative transaction of inquiry" in her vision that enjoined community and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001449588|title=The use of resources in education|last=Clapp|first=Elsie Ripley.|date=1952-01-01|publisher=Harper|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii-xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence, meaning that which is acquired through inquiry and testing, allows man to foresee consequences and take control of his actions without dogma or beliefs (that might be wrong) derived from past experience or expectations.  If the study of politics in philosophy is a "study of force," of knowing "what actions are permissible" given that man is an organism-environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/FiveBranchesMain.html|title=Branches of Philosophy|last=Landauer|first=Jeff|last2=Rowlands|first2=Joseph|date=2001|website=www.importanceofphilosophy.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; then transactionalists assert that cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry are vital to functioning among others.

''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' noted that Dewey was critical of the classical neoliberal stance that the asbtract individual precedes a conception of society or social institutions. Dewey maintained that social institutions were not a "means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for 'creating' individuals" (''Reconstruction in Philosophy'', ''MW''12, 190-192). In this way, classical liberalism seems to exemplify ‘the most pervasive fallacy of philosophical thinking’ (‘Context and Thought’, ''LW''5, 5). Transactionalism is a radical form of governing that resists the tendency to "divide up experienced phenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate existences, independent both of the analysis and of each other."&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Festenstein|first=Matthew|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent thinking is anti-dualistic, accurate, forethought taking into account other people, communities, and cultures that stems from a "deliberate control of what is done with reference to making what happens to us and what we do to things as fertile as possible of suggestions (of suggested meanings)." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Transactionalism.html?id=JbC_nQEACAAJ|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor Joseph|date=1967-01-01|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=175|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, intelligent thinking is a means for trying out the validity of those suggestions. The political governing of thinking towards dualisms and bifurcation as well as the "false conception of the individual" is what Dewey argued limited man's free, meaning "liberal", thought and action. All of this served as the core reasoning behind Dewey's development of an experimental philosophy that offset elite distortions regarding a public and transactional interest in education and learning.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Individual as co-constitutive, organism-environment ====
Transationalist psychologists and educational philosophers reject the ideologies precipitated from Western ideologies of "[[Do It Yourself (disambiguation)|do-it-yourself]]" or the "if it's up to me, it will be" mentality that leads to entitlement and the naiveté of slogans like "follow your passion" that deny any consideration of our trans-dermal condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influenceecology.com/category/podcast/|title=Podcast Archives – Influence Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=Influence Ecology|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-07|quote=#20: Joanna Burgraf - Worst Advice Ever: Follow Your Passion by Influence Ecology / December 19, 2016 Joanna Burgraf is a Chicago-based senior lead for an award-winning creative services team managing ten brands at Enova International, a company using technology to develop innovative financial products.

Transactionalist psychologists and philosophers replace once sought-after [[Existentialism]] as a remedy to feelings of alienation with a trans-dermal orientation to living. Rather than applying a theory or approach that emphasizes the individual as a "free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=existentialism&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|title=existentialism - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; subjects are invited to co-create as an organism-environment functioning among all other organism-environments, including the conditions and consequences of objects and personalities, in order to intelligently structure existence in and amongst it all.

Based on studies by transactionalist psychologists [[Adelbert Ames Jr.|Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] (known for The Ames Demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weipeng Liu (YouTube Channel)|title=Ames' Window|date=2009-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc_LqIaO2b8|accessdate=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[William Howard Ittelson]], [[Hadley Cantril]], along with [[John Dewey]], the biological role of perception is key to understanding transactionalism. Perceiving is viewed as "part of the process of living by which each one of us, from his own particular point of view, creates for himself the world within which he has his life’s experiences and through which he strives to gain his satisfactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Perception.html?id=yFEAAAAAMAAJ|title=Perception: A Transactional Approach|last=Ittelson|first=William Howard|last2=Cantril|first2=Hadley|date=1954-01-01|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum total of these assumptions was recognized as the "assumptive world."&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=146|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptive world stems from all that we [[experience]], all the things and events we assess and assign meaning to, which function as a ''contextual whole'' also known as a ''transactional whole''. Dewey also referred to the assumptive world as a "situation" (where organism and environment are inseparable) or as a "field" in which behavior, stimulus, and response are framed as if a ''reflexive circuit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To the modern transactionalist, experiences alter perceptual processes, and in the act of altering them, the purposing aspect of perception is either furthered or its fulfillment interfered with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=189|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through action, through movement, that man is capable of bringing forth a value-satisfaction to his or her experience.  Man's capacity to "sense value in the quality of his experience" was registered through his serial expectations and standards stemming from previous transactions throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=144–5|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of value is therefore derived from one's behavioral inquiry within an assumptive world. "Knowledge is a transaction that develops out of man's explorations within [that] cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists reject the notion that any truth is inherently settled or beyond question. The consequences of any inquiry will be dependent on the ''situation'' or transactional whole in which man as an organism-environment finds him- or her-self.

To clarify the theory of valuation for man, John Dewey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To declare something ''satisfactory'' [vs. satisfying] is to assert that it meets specifiable conditions. It is, in effect, a judgment that the thing 'will do'. It involves a prediction; it contemplates a future in which the thing will continue to serve; it ''will'' do. It asserts a consequence the thing will actively institute, it ''will''  do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[ John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=104|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, transactionalism is a move away from the conclusion that knowledge depends on an independent knower and something to be known.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The reality of a particular situation depends, transactionally speaking, on the interpretation place[d] upon the situation by a particular person. Interpretation is possible only through the accumulation of experience which, in effect, is what is meant by “assumptions”.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Without the hitches and mistakes one encounters in the welter of daily living, the nature of the assumptive world would never arise into consciousness.  The assumptive world, initially highlighted in the 25 experiments in perception known as The Ames demonstrations, becomes the seeming reality of our world.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Man’s transactions of living involve, in sum, capacities, and aspects of his nature operating together. To transact is to participate in the process of translating the ongoing energies of the environment into one’s own perceptual awareness, and to transform the environment through the perceptual act.  Value-satisfaction arises when the inadequacies of man's assumptive world are revealed or invalidated.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Thereby, the consequences of any transactional experience determines what is valuable or what will do vs. that which is satisfying but will not do.  The good life, for the transactionalist, consists of a unity of values, achieved by means of reflective thought, and accepted in the full light of their conditions and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=106|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To transact is to act intelligently with an aim in mind while avoiding the tendency to surrender one's awareness to complacency or indifference that stems from mere information or untested knowledge. Without action, a person can fool herself, distort her sense of satisfaction or value on behalf of consequences she or others prefer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=161|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through action, the individual perceptions and the shared perceptual common sense of an assumptive world are validated and modified.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Richard L|year=1987|title=Analogue Transactions with Adelbert Ames|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/doi/abs/10.1068/p160277|journal=Perception|volume=16|issue=3|pages=277–282|doi=10.1068/p160277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; We predict and refine our conditions of life yet "any standard set for these value qualities is influenced by the individual’s personal biological and life history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=160|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalism is a creativee process that takes into account the unique biology and biography of persons involved.

==  Generational significance ==
The importance of the study of transactionalism arose in the late 1960s in response to an "alienation syndrome"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|page=27|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; among youth of that generation. As the counter-culture challenged and reassessed society's "philosophical-psychological complex, its ''[[Weltanschauung]]'',"&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/paltow|title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics|last=Palmer.|first=Gary B.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; their political and social alienation sparked protests against the war and the draft as well as historic racial rebellions in various U.S. cities.  The [[Long hot summer of 1967]] and the counterculture movement named the [[Summer of Love]] also in 1967 reflected the antipathy of young people who questioned everything. American society's norms and values were perceived as denying dignity to all. Riots of the period were studied in a report by the U.S. [[Kerner Commission]] and scholars began to study the patterns of alienation expressed by youth in the sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisner|first=Victor|date=1969-02-01|title=Alienation of Youth|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x/abstract|journal=Journal of School Health|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=81–90|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x|issn=1746-1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zack|first=John J.|date=1970-06-01|title=The Alienation of Youth|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=16|issue=6|pages=56–59|issn=0008-350X|pmc=2281733|pmid=20468522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Marvin E.|date=1969-03-01|title=Two Categories of Political Alienation|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/3/288|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.2307/2575027|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watts|first=William A.|last2=Lynch|first2=Steve|last3=Whittaker|first3=David|date=1969-01-01|title=Alienation and activism in today's college-age youth: Socialization patterns and current family relationships.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cou/16/1/1/|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|language=English|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1037/h0026683|issn=1939-2168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polk|first=Kenneth|date=1969-10-01|title=Class, Strain and Rebellion Among Adolescents|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/2/214|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=214–224|doi=10.2307/799867|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth sought a kind of [[existentialism]] expressed by a need to be "true to oneself." This current of alienation unfortunately veered away from a relevant understanding of the transactional whole taking into account the reciprocal and co-constitutive nature of man as an organism-environment fulfilling important conditions of life with others all the time. It resembles the famous line from ''[[Devotions upon Emergent Occasions]]'', written by English poet John Donne -- "No man is an island". Transactionalism presented an alternative to the limitation and unintended outcomes of the alienation syndrome.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Benefits and applications==
Designed to account for all aspects of experience—subjective and objective—transactionalism requires a slowing down in assessing all the facts involved with the how, what, when, where, and why as we move to transact with others. It demands and requires always considering how a transaction with another and one's self (e.g., a parent or spouse spending additional hours socializing at the gym) is or is not beneficial to all involved in a transaction (e.g., other members of the family). The costs may be in time, attention, or money or in a condition of life (e.g., family, career, sleep). Transactionalism requires an interdependence of thought, study, and action.

A transactionalist must account for one's biology and cognition ([[metaphysics]]); the ways knowing reality ([[epistemology]]); the reciprocal, co-constitutive, relationship (or [[ethics]]) between our social self and the interactions constrained by both our natural and man-made environment. We as human beings live in distinct sociological patterns with people, material and immaterial culture shaped by specific and ever-changing times and places further articulated by increasing migration and globalization. Transactionalism insists that one attend to the political distribution of goods and services along with the ways its value has and is exchanged and changing among people and groups ([[politics]]) as well as how persons are socialized to understand what it means to live a good life as well as fulfill those conditions over time ([[aesthetics]]).

Transactionalism offers more than existentialism offered with its aim of being "true to oneself." The alienation that results from its orientation to the self at the expense of societal norms and values, even in small groups, often leads to naiveté, despair, frustration, agitation, and even indifference, at the expense of consciously organizing one's acts, while functioning among others, to fulfill one's unique and necessary interests in living a good and satisfying life. Transactionalism counters the naive  "do as I see fit" mentality of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] regardless of other's needs and concerns, which inevitably leads to negative consequences and outcomes over time. Transactionalism depends upon the "integration of man and his surroundings."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Phillips' dissertation documented the evolution of a "transactional approach;" one that rests on the fact that we are [[Biological basis of personality|biological]], [[Linguistic performance|linguistic]], and that we must transact considering a trans-dermal experience of our thoughts, behavior, and exchange on every level imagined while ethically functioning with others well.

A series of podcasts exemplify the application of a transactional approach to a diverse array of professionals from various countries .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/influence-ecology/id1146278689|title=Influence Ecology by Influence Ecology on iTunes|website=iTunes|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Universalism|expanded=all}}
'''Universalism''' is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application or applicability.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A community that calls itself ''universalist'' may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner. It is centered around the belief in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For example, some forms of [[Abrahamic religions]] claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and "feel inclusive"{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--"claim universal value" is very different from "feel inclusive". What does the latter even mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'/&gt;

[[Christian Universalism]] is focused around the idea of [[universal reconciliation]]. Also known as universal salvation, it is a doctrine stating that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Otis Ainsworth Skinner (1807-1861), ''A Series of Sermons in Defense of the Doctrine of Universal Salvation'', Page 209, It is not part of mainline Christian doctrine either Catholic or Protestant. "Repentance is a means by which all men are brought into the enjoyment of religion, and we do expect any man will be saved while he continues in sin. However, Unitarian Universalism holds a universal salvation, because is, "we expect all men will repent."&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in Universalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the [[Rig Veda]] states, "Truth is one; sages call it by various names."&lt;ref&gt;[https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/harmony-of-religions/ Vedanta Society of Southern California ''Harmony of Religions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism has had an influence on modern day [[Hinduism]], in turn influencing western modern spirituality.{{sfn|King|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Unitarian Universalism]] emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality, and also focuses on the universal principles of most religions. They accept all religions in an inclusive manner.

==Philosophy==
===Universality===
{{Main|Universality (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, universality is the notion that universal facts can be discovered and is therefore understood as being in opposition to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). ''Anti-Racism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain religions, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe.

=== Moral universalism ===
{{Main|Moral universalism|Moral particularism}}
Moral universalism (also called ''moral objectivism'' or ''universal morality'') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] position that some system of [[ethics]] are applied [[universality (philosophy)|universally]]. That system is inclusive of all individuals,&lt;ref name=PhilPages&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm#unvby |title=A Dictionary of Philosophical Terms and Names |work=Philosophy Pages |first=Garth|last=Kemerling |date=November 12, 2011 |quote=According to [http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/kant.htm Immanuel Kant] and [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/h.htm#hare Richard Mervyn Hare]...moral imperatives must be regarded as equally binding on everyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other distinguishing feature.&lt;ref name=Gowans&gt;{{cite web |quote=Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that moral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or universal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes are justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false ones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and well-informed person. |first=Chris|last=Gowans |title=Moral Relativism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/ |date=Dec 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral universalism is opposed to [[moral nihilism]] and [[moral relativism]]. However, not all forms of moral universalism are [[moral absolutism|absolutist]], nor do they necessarily [[value monism]]. Many forms of universalism, such as [[utilitarianism]], are non-absolutist. Other forms such as those theorized by [[Isaiah Berlin]], may [[value pluralism|value pluralist ideals.]]

==Religion==

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
In Bahá'í belief, a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]]. As a result, the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose. In this view, there is unity among the founders of world religions, but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paradise and Paradigm: Key Symbols in Persian Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1999 |page=292 |last=Buck |first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this universal view, the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="Stockman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Stockman |title=Sourcebook of the World's Religions |isbn=1-57731-121-3 |publisher=New World Library |year=2000 |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Beversluis|chapter=The Baha'i Faith |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people with regard to race, colour or religion.&lt;ref name="Smith138"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockman" /&gt; Hence the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.&lt;ref name="Smith138" /&gt;

The teaching, however, does not equate unity with uniformity; instead the Bahá'í writings advocate the principle of ''unity in diversity'' where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards, and the inevitability of, [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="Smith-peace"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=peace |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is [[universal reconciliation]] – that all humans will eventually be saved. They will eventually enter God's kingdom in Heaven, through the grace and works of the lord [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=What Is Christian Universalism? |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal [[Hell]] does not exist, and that it was not what Jesus had taught. They point to historical evidence showing that some early fathers of the church were universalists, and attribute the perpetuating idea of hell to eternal mistranslation.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/ The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Amirault |url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html |title=The Fate of the Wicked |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they argue that an eternal hell is both unjust, and against the nature and attributes of a loving God.&lt;ref&gt;Guild, E.E. 'Arguments in Favour of Universalism'. http://www.tentmaker.org/books/InFavorCh20.html
http://godfire.net/eby/saviour_of_the_world.html
http://www.godfire.net/Hellidx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are generally compatible with the fundamentals of Christianity{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* [[God in Christianity|God]] is the loving Parent of all peoples, see [[Love of God]].
* [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] reveals the nature and character of God, and is the spiritual leader of humankind.
* Humankind is created with an [[immortal soul]], which death can not end—or a [[Christian mortalism|mortal soul]] that shall be resurrected and preserved by God. A soul which God will not wholly destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/TheBibleHell.html ''The Bible Hell'']. TentMaker.org. "The immortal soul is not meant, but the life. As though Jesus had said: "Fear Not those who can only kill the body, but rather him, who ''if he chose could'' destroy the soul"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian views on sin|Sin]] has negative consequences for the sinner either in this life or the [[afterlife]]. All of God's punishments for sin are corrective and remedial. None of such punishments will last forever, or result in the permanent destruction of a soul. Some Christian Universalists believe in the idea of a Purgatorial Hell, or a temporary place of purification that some must undergo before their entrance into Heaven.&lt;ref name="Scott2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Van Scott |title=The Encyclopedia of Hell: A Comprehensive Survey of the Underworld |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1EnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240 |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-4668-9119-7 |page=240 |chapter=Purgatorial Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the [[Universalist Church of America]], adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, the reality of sin and [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/prof.html |title=See section entitled "Five Principles of Faith" |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalist writers such as [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T.

Origen and Clement both included the existence of a non-eternal Hell in their teachings. Hell was remedial, in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering into Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanrock.net/2015/05/20/purgatorial-hell-faq/ |title=Purgatorial Hell FAQ |publisher=StanRock.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first undisputed documentations of Christian Universalist ideas occurred in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe as well as in colonial America. Between 1648-1697 English activist [[Gerrard Winstanley]], writer [[Richard Coppin]], and dissenter [[Jane Leade]], each taught that God would grant all human beings salvation. The same teachings were later spread throughout 18th-century France and America by [[George de Benneville]]. People who taught this doctrine in America would later become known as the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyatt |first1=Neal |last2=Dwyer |first2=Tierney V |last3=Dwyer |first3=Tierney V |year=2008 |title=Unitarian Universalism: A Research Guide |url=|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=3|pages=210–214 |doi=10.5860/rusq.47n3.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''[[apocatastasis|apocatastas]]'' came to be related by some to the beliefs of [[Christian Universalism]], but central to the doctrine was the restitution, or restoration of all sinful beings to God, and to His state of blessedness.  In early [[Patristics]], usage of the term is distinct.

====Universalist theology====
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
{{religious text primary|section|date=February 2012}}
Universalist theology is grounded in history, scripture and assumptions about the nature of God. [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Whittemore]] wrote the book "100 Scriptural Proofs that Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/ScripturalProofs.html |title=100 Scriptural Proofs That Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoting both Old and New Testament verses which support the Universalist viewpoint.

Some Bible verses he cites and are cited by other Christian Universalists are:
# 1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;ref name="Tent"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Wicked|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html|work=tentmaker.org|publisher=Tentmaker|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Tentmaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "For as in Adam '''ALL''' die, so also in Christ shall '''ALL''' be made alive." ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]; emphasis added)
# 2 Peter 3:9
#* "'''The Lord''' is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, '''not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# 1 Timothy 2:3–6&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who '''wants all men to be saved''' and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for '''ALL''' men—the testimony given in its proper time." (NIV; emphasis added)
# 1 John 2:2
#* "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." (NIV)
# 1 Timothy 4:10&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the '''Savior of all people, especially of those who believe'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# Romans 11:32&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all." (NIV)

====Mistranslations====
Christian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as giving rise to the idea of Eternal Hell, and the idea that some people will not be saved.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tentmaker1"&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html "Eternal" Punishment (Matthew 25:46) Is NOT Found In The Greek New Testament.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carm.org/look-word-aionion A look at the word "aionion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Greek word is the origin of the modern English word [[aeon]], which refers to a period of time or an epoch.

The 19th century theologian [[Marvin Vincent]] wrote about the word ''aion'', and the supposed connotations of "eternal" or "temporal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Aion''', transliterated '''''aeon''''', is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. [...] Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of ''endless'' or ''everlasting''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=Marvin|title=Note on Olethron Aionion (eternal destruction)|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/vincent.html|work=Word Studies in the New Testament|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Ken Vincent writes that "When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, "aion" became "aeternam" which means "eternal".&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"/&gt;

====New Thought====
{{Main|New Thought}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
[[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Divine Science]] are denominations within the New Thought movement. Each teaches that there is a common thread of truth at the heart of all religions. New Thought is an ever-evolving belief system which will incorporate ''Truth'' where ever it is found, hence the name ''New Thought''. ''All is God, But God transcends all''.

====Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a theologically liberal religion characterized by a "free and responsible search for truth and meaning".&lt;ref&gt;(The 4th principle of Unitarian Universalism)[http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml UUA.org Seven principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists do not share a [[creed]]; rather, they are unified by their shared search for [[spiritual growth]] and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not a result of obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian Universalists draw from all major world religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Rastafarianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many different theological sources and have a wide range of beliefs and practices.

While having its origins in Christianity, UU is no longer a Christian church. As of 2006, fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=James Ishmael |title=Zen Master Who? |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |year=2006 |page=187 |isbn=0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief, whereby members may describe themselves as [[Humanism|humanist]], agnostic, [[deist]], [[atheist]], pagan, Christian, [[monotheist]], [[pantheism|pantheist]], [[polytheist]], or assume no label at all.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) was formed in 1961, a consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]], established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America,&lt;ref name="harvard1"&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1866. It is headquartered in [[Boston]], and mainly serves churches in the United States. The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] became an independent body in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;CUC-UUA Tradition. Canadian Unitarian Council [http://cuc.ca/who_we_are/cuc-uua_transition.htm Growing Vital Religious Communities In Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-religious Universalism=====
Universalism is not only a set of values, but a worldview to which any can subscribe if they observe and believe in the universality of the human experience—and that of all sentient life—and work to uphold the principles, ethics, and actions that safeguard these fundamental things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/unitarianuniversalism.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many Universalists may be attracted to the logic of universally applicable principles, rather than any belief or dogma. Human unity, solidarity, and the perceived need for a sustainable and socially conscious global order are among the tendencies of non-religious Universalist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/u-u.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Author David Frawley says that Hinduism has a "background universalism" and its teachings contain a "universal relevance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haindavakeralam.com/pluralism-and-universalism-within-hinduism-david-frawley-hk5500 ''Pluralism and Universalism Within Hinduism''] "Hindu teachings were also denigrated accordingly and the deeper philosophies of Hinduism were often ignored, especially their universal relevance. For conversion purposes it was easier to define Hinduism in a limited way as a local phenomenon only. Yet the universality of Hindu teachings continued, though few outside of India understood this until recent years. This background universalism of Sanatana Dharma affords Hinduism a synthetic tendency, an ability to incorporate within itself a diversity of views and approaches, including at times those from groups outside of Hinduism or even opposed to Hinduism. Because of this syncretic view, sometimes Hinduism is equated with a blind universalism that accepts without discrimination anything that calls itself religious or spiritual, as if differences of spiritual teachings did not matter in any way. While this may be true of some Hindus, the Hindu tradition also contains a lively tradition of free debate on all aspects of theology, philosophy and metaphysics, showing differences as well as similarities, and not simply equating all teachings as they are. A good example of this is the debates between the dualistic and non-dualistic schools of Vedantic philosophy, but many other examples exist as well. The different sects within Hinduism have always been free to disagree, though each sect has its particular guidelines and there is an overall respect for Dharma."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] is also naturally [[Religious pluralism|religiously pluralistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation "Hinduism Basics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously."&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: "As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 211. {{ISBN|0-87395-831-4}}, which translates the same passage as "They who, in whatever way, take refuge in Me, them I reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) {{ISBN|1-884852-04-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions, it also has a wide range of diversity within it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation ''Hinduism Basics'' "It is a richly diverse family of philosophies, traditions, and practices that have been followed primarily throughout Asia for thousands of years."]&lt;/ref&gt; There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://veden-akademie.de/index.php?article_id=154&amp;clang=1 "Shat-darshana: The Philosophical Schools of Sanatana Dharma"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple unorthodox or "hetrodox" traditions called [[darshanas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearias.com/indian-philosophy-schools/ ''Indian Philosophy: Orthodox and Heterodox Schools'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Universalism====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu reform movements}}
''Hindu Universalism'', also called ''Neo-Vedanta''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neo-Hinduism'',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and [[orientalism]]. It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith|year=2007|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|isbn=1934145009|page=416|author=Editors of Hinduism Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} For example, it presents that:
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Rigveda 1:164:46) "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti" - Truth is one; sages call it many names&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Maha Upanishad: Chapter 6, Verse 72) "[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]" - The entire world is a one big family&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Badlani |first=Hiro |title=Hinduism: Path of the Ancient Wisdom |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8NrQhyxH-GgC |isbn=978-0-595-70183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was [[Ram Mohan Roy]], who established the [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Ghazi|2010}} Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]]{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Veneration for all other religions was articulated by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]:
{{quote|After long study and experience, I have come to the conclusion that [1] all religions are true; [2] all religions have some error in them; [3] all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism, in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives. My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith; therefore no thought of conversion is possible.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, ''All Men Are Brothers: Life and Thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi as told in his own words'', Paris, UNESCO 1958, p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation, regarding Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{Citation not found}}

===Islam===
{{Further|Ummah|Divisions of the world in Islam|People of the Book|Dhimmi|Dawah|}}
{{Original Research|date=June 2018}}
Islam recognizes to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Quran]] identifying Jews, Christians, and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandaeans]]) as "people of the Book" (''ahl al-kitab''). Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include [[Zoroastrians]], and later even Hindus, as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion, but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews, Christians, and [[Sabians]] as People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone|first=Patricia|title=God's Rule: Government and Islam: Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political Thought|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13291-6|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2015}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lapidus|first1=Ira M.|title=Ira M.

There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism. According to the most inclusive teachings, common among the [[liberal Muslim movements]], all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation. For example, Surah 2:62,256 states that:&lt;ref&gt;1. S. A. Rahman, Punishment of Apostasy in Islam, Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} {{quote|Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve...let there be no compulsion in religion}}

However, the most exclusive teachings disagree. For example, the [[Salafi]] refer to Surah 9:5,29:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} {{quote|Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters [''mushrikun''] wherever ye find them, and take them, and besiege them, and lay in wait in every stratagem of war. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the ''Zakat'', then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful [...] Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture [i.e. people of the book] as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the ''jizya'' readily, being brought low [in submission].}}

The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought, traditionalist and reform-minded, and branches of Islam, from the reforming [[Quranism]] and [[Ahmadiyya]] to the ultra-traditionalist [[Salafi]], as is the doctrine of abrogation (''[[Naskh (tafsir)|naskh]]'') which is used to determine which verses take precedence, based on reconstructed chronology, with later verses superseding earlier ones. The traditional chronology places Surah 9 as the last or second-to-last surah revealed, thus, in traditional exegesis, it gains a large power of abrogation, and verses 9:5,29,73 are held to have abrogated 2:256&lt;ref name="Ibn Kathir 2000 6608"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail (1301-1373)|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Aziz (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)|year=2000|publisher=Maktaba Darussalam|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|isbn=978-1-59144-020-8|page=6608|edition=English Abridged|editor=Sheikh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ahadith also play a major role in this, and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith, with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections, generally along with the [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]. Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions, the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely, from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith, to the Salafi, or ''ahl al-hadith'', who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on religious pluralism}}
{{See also|Noahidism}}
Judaism teaches that God [[Jews as the chosen people|chose the Jewish people]] to be in a unique covenant with God, and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the [[Torah]] with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations. This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as [[Noahidism|Noachides]], and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God, as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polish |first1=David |year=1985 |title=Covenant-Jewish Universalism and Particularism |journal=Judaism |volume=34 |issue=3 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An on-line organization, the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by [[Steven Blane]], who calls himself an "American Jewish Universalist Rabbi", believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism, stating that "God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world, and we have much to learn and share with each other. We can only accomplish [[Tikkun Olam]] by our unconditional acceptance of each other's peaceful doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Universalism|url=http://www.jsli.net/jewish-universalism|work=Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===

{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

}}
In [[Sikhism]], all the religions of the world are compared to rivers flowing into a single ocean. Although the [[Sikh gurus]] did not agree with the practices of [[fasting]], [[idolatry]] and pilgrimage during their times, they stressed that all religions should be tolerated and considered on equal footing. The Sikh scripture, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], contains the writings of not just the Sikh guru themselves, but the writings of several Hindu and Muslim saints, known as the ''[[Bhagat]]s''. 

The very first word of the Sikh scripture is "Ik", followed by "Oh-ang-kar". This literally means that there is only one god, and that one is wholesome, inclusive of the whole universe. It further goes on to state that all of creation, and all energy is part of this primordial being. As such, it is described in scripture over and over again, that all that occurs is part of the divine will, and as such, has to be accepted. It occurs for a reason, even if its beyond the grasp of one person to understand.

Although Sikhism does not teach that men are created as an [[image of God]], it states that the essence of the One is to be found throughout all of its creation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As was said by Yogi Bhajan, the man who is credited with having brought Sikhism to the West:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all". (Sri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhdharma.org/about-the-siri-singh-sahib-yogi-bhajan/|title=About the Siri Singh Sahib – Sikh Dharma International|website=www.sikhdharma.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]] said himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/There_is_no_Hindu_and_no_Musalman|title=There is no Hindu and no Musalman - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm|title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People|website=www.sikhs.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/gurunanakforchildren/chapter4/#No%20Hindu,%20and%20no%20Muslim|title=Guru Nanak (for Children) - No Hindu, and no Muslim|last=Munde |first=Amarpreet Singh|website=www.gurmat.info|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this, Guru Nanak meant that there is no distinction between religion in God's eyes, whether polytheist, monotheist, [[pantheist]], or even atheist, all that one needs to gain salvation is purity of heart, tolerance of all beings, compassion and kindness. Unlike many of the major world religions, Sikhism does not have [[proselytism|missionaries]], instead it believes men have the freedom to find their own path to [[salvation]].

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
Some varieties of Zoroastrian (such as [[Zurvanism]]) are universalistic in application to all races, but not necessarily universalist in the sense of universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Porter Berkey ''The formation of Islam: religion and society in the Near East'' 2003 p28 "This is not to say that there was no universalist dimension to Zoroastrian religious life; but what universalism there was derived directly, and to a greater degree than in the case of Rome and Christianity, from the explicit connection between religion and the state."&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2015}}

==Critics==
In his book ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God'', the Australian philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] noted that whilst in the past a miracle performed by Jesus had served as proof to Christians that he was the 'one true God', and that a miracle performed by another religion's deity had served as a (contradictory) proof to its own adherents, the universalist approach resulted in any such miracle being accepted as a validation of all religions, a situation that he characterised as "Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Mackie |author-first1=J. L. |title=The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=November 1982 |isbn=978-0198246824|quote="It is no longer 'The heathen in his blindness…', but rather 'We worship the same god, but under different names and in different ways’. Carried far enough, this modern tendency would allow Christian miracles to support, not undermine, belief in the supernatural achievements of stone-age witch doctors and medicine men, and vice versa. It is as if someone had coined the slogan, Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raphael - Cardinal and Theological Virtues.jpg|thumb|400px|''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' by [[Raphael]], 1511]]

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]]. 

The four classic cardinal  virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by up to ten virtues,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
[[File:Maat.svg|thumb|upright|[[Maat]], to [[ancient Egypt]]ians, personified the virtue of [[truth]] and [[justice]]. Her feather represents truth.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, M. (2004), Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During Egyptian civilization, [[Maat]] or Ma'at (thought to have been pronounced *[muʔ.ʕat]), also spelled māt or mayet, was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], [[balance (metaphysics)|balance]], [[Natural order (philosophy)|order]], [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. Maat was also personified as a goddess regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], who symbolized [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]], lies, and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Norman Rufus Colin Cohn| title = Cosmos, Caos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-300-05598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Assmann]], Translated by Rodney Livingstone, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8047-4523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Personification]] of virtue ([[Greek Language|Greek]] ''Ἀρετή'') in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesos]], [[Turkey]]]]

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in [[Meno]], when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, without being miserly.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* [[justice|Iustitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius| Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chivalric virtues==
In the 8th Century, upon the occasion of his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] published a list of knightly virtues:

Love God
Love your neighbour
Give alms to the poor
Entertain strangers
Visit the sick
Be merciful to prisoners
Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
Redeem the captive
Help the oppressed
Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
Render righteous judgement
Do not consent to any wrong
Persevere not in wrath
Shun excess in eating and drinking
Be humble and kind
Serve your liege lord faithfully
Do not steal
Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious traditions ==

===Judaism===
{{main article|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31). Wisdom is also celebrated in the [[Book of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/7#27007022|title=Wisdom, Chapter 7, Verse 22|last=|first=|date=|website=USCCB Bible|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main article|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Islam===
{{main article|Islamic views on virtue}}
In Islam, the [[Qur'an]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue. [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The [[hadiths]], his reported sayings, are central to the Islamic understanding of virtue.

Virtue is defined in [[hadith]]. It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Piety/virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about Piety/virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety/virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

For Muslims fulfilling the human rights are valued as an important building block of Islam, According to Muslim beliefs Allah will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of humans and injustice with others will only be pardoned by the humans and not by Allah.
===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], attainment of [[enlightenment]] is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All [[Jains]] are supposed to take up the five vows of [[ahimsa]] (non violence), [[satya]] (truthfulness), [[asteya]] (non stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non attachment and [[brahmacharya]] (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the [[Tirthankaras]]. Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint and straightforwardness. These vows assists the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/bliss-of-wisdom/जैन-धर्म-के-पाँच-मूलभूत-सिद्धांत-bfc9b756d509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main article|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

While [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and their descendants opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main article|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

{{distinguish|Wilderness}}

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;
